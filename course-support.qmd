title: "Course support"
---

Most of you will need help at some point, and we want to make sure you can identify where that is so that you don't get too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.

## Lectures and labs

If you have a question during the lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so asking will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

## Help from humans

### Office hours

The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours during the times posted on the home page to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered in person, so office hours are a valuable resource. I encourage each and every one of you to take advantage of this resource! Make a pledge to stop by during office hours at least once during the first three weeks of class. If you have no questions, stop by and say hi and introduce yourself. You can find a list of everyone's office hours [here](/course-team.html).

My office hours will start in Week 1, TA office hours will start in Week 2.

### Ed Discussion

Have a question that can't wait for office hours? Prefer to write out your question in detail rather than asking in person? The course discussion forum, Ed Discussion, is the best venue for these! There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on before asking a new question. If you know the answer to a question that is posted, I encourage you to respond!

You can access this tool on the course website toolbar -- just click on the lifesaver icon.

## Email

Please refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go to Ed Discussion), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g., illness, accommodations, etc.). For such matters, you may email Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel at [mc301\@duke.edu](mailto:mc301@duke.edu).

If there is a question that's not appropriate for the public forum, you are welcome to email me directly. **If you email me, please include "STA 199" in the subject line.** Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to STA 199 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.

## Academic support

There are times you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team. In those instances, I encourage you to visit the Academic Resource Center. The [Academic Resource Center (ARC)](https://arc.duke.edu) offers free services to all students during their undergraduate careers at Duke. Services include Learning Consultations, Peer Tutoring and Study Groups, ADHD/LD Coaching, Outreach Workshops, and more. Because learning is a process unique to every individual, they work with each student to discover and develop their own academic strategy for success at Duke. Contact the ARC to schedule an appointment. Undergraduates in any year, studying any discipline can benefit! Contact [theARC\@duke.edu](mailto:theARC@duke.edu), 919-684-5917.

## Assistance with Zoom or Canvas

For technical help with Canvas visit [go.canvas.duke.edu/get-help/](https://go.canvas.duke.edu/get-help/). For technical help with Zoom contact the Duke OIT Service Desk at [oit.duke.edu/help](https://oit.duke.edu/help). You can also access the self-service help documentation for [Zoom](https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0029318/) and [Canvas](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/tkb-p/student).

Note that we will be using Canvas minimally in this course (primarily for announcements and the grade book). All assignment submissions will take place on Gradescope and GitHub, and conversations will take place on Ed Discussion.

Zoom will be used for online office hours and as a backup option should we need to hold the course online instead of in person.
