These are suggested answers.
This document should be used as a reference only; it's not designed to be an exhaustive key.
:::

**Demo:** Replace "Your Name" above with your actual name.
Then, render the document to inspect the changes.
Once you confirm you're happy with the changes, commit your changes (with an appropriate commit message) by staging **ALL** of the changed files, and push them to GitHub.
In your browser, navigate to your GitHub repository and confirm that the changes are reflected there.

The dataset we will explore is in the data folder and it's called `income-inequality.csv`.
It contains data on income inequality, measured by the GINI coefficient for different countries and years.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient):

> A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same.
> In contrast, a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values, where a single individual has all the income while all others have none.

In this dataset we have two Gini coefficients: one for income inequality before taxes and another for income inequality after taxes.
These two values allow us to explore how much countries redistribute income.
In addition, since we have data for multiple years, we can also explore how income inequality has changed over time.

## Packages

For this application exercise, we'll use the **tidyverse** package.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
library(tidyverse)
```

**Demo:** Run the code cell above and inspect the message printed in the Console.

## Data

Let's load the data.

```{r}
#| label: laod-data
income_inequality <- read_csv("data/income-inequality.csv")
```

And take a look at the first 10 rows.

```{r}
#| label: view-data
income_inequality
```

The variables in the dataset are:

-   `country`: Country name
-   `country_code`: Country code
-   `year`: Year
-   `gini_pre_tax`: Gini coefficient before taxes
-   `gini_post_tax`: Gini coefficient after taxes

**Demo:** And take a look at the structure of the data as well with the `glimpse()` function.

```{r}
#| label: glimpse-data
glimpse(income_inequality)
```

**Demo:** Render, commit (with an appropriate commit message), and push your changes to GitHub.

**Your turn:** replace the blank below with the number of rows in the `income_inequality` data frame based on the output of the chunk below.
Then, replace it with "inline code" and render again.
Then, commit (with an appropriate commit message) and push your changes to GitHub.

The `income_inequality` data frame has `{r} nrow(income_inequality)` observations.
Each observation represents a country in a given year.

## Income inequality over time in a country

Let's explore income inequality over time in a country.

```{r}
#| label: plot-single
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.3
income_inequality |>
  filter(country == "Denmark") |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = contains("gini"),
    names_to = "gini_type",
    values_to = "gini_coefficient"
  ) |>
  mutate(
    gini_type = if_else(gini_type == "gini_pre_tax", "Pre-tax", "Post-tax"),
    gini_type = fct_relevel(gini_type, "Pre-tax", "Post-tax")
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gini_coefficient, color = gini_type)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1)
```

**Your turn:** Create a similar plot for another country of your choice by by modifying the code in the code cell labeled `plot-single` above.
Then, render, commit (with an appropriate commit message), and push your changes to GitHub.

*Hint:* Open the data frame in the data viewer by clicking on its name in the Environment pane to see the list of countries.

## Income inequality over time in many countries

Now let's explore income inequality over time in many countries.

```{r}
#| label: plot-many
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.8
income_inequality |>
  filter(country %in% c("United States", "Sweden", "South Africa")) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = contains("gini"),
    names_to = "gini_type",
    values_to = "gini_coefficient"
  ) |>
  mutate(
    gini_type = if_else(gini_type == "gini_pre_tax", "Pre-tax", "Post-tax"),
    gini_type = fct_relevel(gini_type, "Pre-tax", "Post-tax")
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gini_coefficient, color = gini_type)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~country, ncol = 1)
```

**Your turn:** Change as many countries as you like except for the United States by modifying the code in the cell labeled `plot-many` above.
You can replace country names like we did before or add or remove them.
Then, render to see your changes.
Discuss your findings with your neighbor -- Why did you choose those countries?
How do the income inequalities of these countries compare?
Finally, commit your changes (with an appropriate commit message), and push your changes to GitHub.
