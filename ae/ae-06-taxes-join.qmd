title: "AE 06: Sales taxes + data joining"

## Getting started

### Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for this analysis.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false
# add code here
```

### Data

The data are available in the `data` folder:

-   `sales-taxes.csv`

-   `us-regions.csv`

```{r}
#| label: load-data
# add code here
```

And let's take a look at the data.

```{r}
#| label: glimpse
# add code here
```

## Joining

Join the sales tax data with region data and save the joined data frame as a new data frame, not overwriting either data frame that goes into the join.

```{r}
#| label: join
# add code here
```

Calculate the average sales tax of states in each region.
What is surprising in the output?

```{r}
#| label: region-means-take-1
# add code here
```

Identify the state with `NA` for region.

```{r}
#| label: identify-na
# add code here
```

Apply a fix for the `NA` in region, and calculate the mean sales taxes for regions again.
Display the results in ascending order of mean sales tax.

```{r}
#| label: region-means-take-2
# add code here
```
