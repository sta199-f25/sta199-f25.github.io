::: wooclap

Put the folllowing tasks in order to scrape data from a website:

::: wooclap-choices
- Use the SelectorGadget identify tags for elements you want to grab
- Use `read_html()` to read the page's source code into R
- Use other functions from the **rvest** package to parse the elements you're interested in
- Put the components together in a data frame (a tibble) and analyze it like you analyze any other data

# From last time

## A new R workflow {.smaller}

-   When working in a Quarto document, your analysis is re-run each time you knit

-   If web scraping in a Quarto document, you'd be re-scraping the data each time you knit, which is undesirable (and not *nice*)!

-   An alternative workflow:

    -   Use an R script to save your code
    -   Saving interim data scraped using the code in the script as CSV or RDS files
    -   Use the saved data in your analysis in your Quarto document


# Scraping from many pages

## Packages

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest) # for web scraping
library(knitr) # for pretty tables
```

## Columns and words

::: question
What additional information do we need to produce the table below?
:::

```{r}
#| include: false
chronicle_article <- read_csv("data/chronicle-article.csv")
```

```{r}
#| label: chronicle-article-word-counts
#| echo: false
chronicle_article |>
  mutate(n_words = str_count(article, " ") + 1) |>
  group_by(column) |>
  summarize(avg_n_words = mean(n_words), n_articles = n()) |>
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c("Column", "Avg. # words/article", "# articles"),
    digits = 0
  )
```

## Start with the URL for an first article

```{r}
#| message: false
chronicle <- read_csv("data/chronicle.csv")

article_url <- chronicle |>
  slice_head(n = 1) |>
  pull()

article_url
```

## Read in the page

```{r}
article_page <- read_html(article_url)

article_page
```

## Identify the elements you want

```
.article-content
```

![](images/14/article-content.png){fig-align="center"}

## Parse the elements you want - 1 {.smaller}

```{r}
#| eval: false
article_page |>
  html_elements(".article-content")

## Parse the elements you want - 3 {.smaller}

```{r}
article_page |>
  html_elements(".article-content") |>
  html_text2() |>

## Wrap in a function

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|4-7"
parse_article_page <- function(url) {
  article_page <- read_html(url)

  article_page |>
    html_elements(".article-content") |>

    str_remove_all("\n")
}
```

## Functions in R {.smaller}

```{r}
#| eval: false
function_name <- function(argument_1, argument_2, ...) {
  # what the function does
}
```

. . .

For example:

```{r}
multiply_by_3 <- function(x) {
  3 * x
}
```

<br>

. . .

```{r}
multiply_by_3(2)
multiply_by_3(10)
```

## Revisit: `parse_article_page()` {.smaller}

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|4|5|6|7"
# fmt: skip
parse_article_page <- function(url) {    # define a function with one argument, url

  article_page |> # start with the page
    html_elements(".article-content") |> # extract element w/ selector .article-content
    html_text2() |>                      # extract text from element (and clean it up)
    str_remove_all("\n")                 # remove all newline characters, return result

  kable()
```

## Update column names {.smaller}

```{r}

```

## Update digits {.smaller}

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|10"

# Privacy

## "Your" data

-   Every time we use apps, websites, and devices, our data is being collected and used or sold to others.

-   More importantly, decisions are made by law enforcement, financial institutions, and governments based on data that directly affect the lives of people.

## Privacy of your data {.smaller}

::: question
What pieces of data have you left on the internet today?
Think through everything you've logged into, clicked on, checked in, either actively or automatically, that might be tracking you.
Do you know where that data is stored?
Who it can be accessed by?
Whether it's shared with others?
:::

## Sharing your data {.smaller}

::: question
What are you OK with sharing?
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
-   Name
-   Age
-   Email
-   Phone Number
-   List of every video you watch
-   List of every video you comment on
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
-   How you type: speed, accuracy
-   How long you spend on different content
-   List of all your private messages (date, time, person sent to)
-   Info about your photos (how it was taken, where it was taken (GPS), when it was taken)
:::
:::
:::

## What does Google think/know about you?

::: question
Have you ever thought about why you're seeing an ad on Google?
Google it!
Try to figure out if you have ad personalization on and how your ads are personalized.
:::

## Your browsing history

::: question
Which of the following are you OK with your browsing history to be used towards?
:::

::: incremental
-   To predict your age for serving you targeted ads
-   To predict your race/ethnicity for serving you targeted ads
-   To score you as a candidate for a job
:::

## Who else gets to use your data?

::: question
Suppose you create a profile on a social media site and share your personal information on your profile.
Who else gets to use that data?
:::

::: incremental
-   Companies the social media company has a connection to?
-   Companies the social media company sells your data to?
-   Researchers?

## OK Cupid data breach

- In 2016, researchers published data of 70,000 OkCupid users—including usernames, political leanings, drug usage, and intimate sexual details

- Researchers didn't release the real names and pictures of OKCupid users, but their identities could easily be uncovered from the details provided, e.g. usernames

## OK Cupid data breach

## OK Cupid data breach

>Some may object to the ethics of gathering and releasing this data. However, all the data found in the dataset are or were already publicly available, so releasing this dataset merely presents it in a more useful form.

# Misrepresentation

## Misrepresenting data science results {.smaller}

Some common ways people do this, either intentionally or unintentionally, include:

::: incremental
-   Claiming **causality** where it's not in the scope of inference of the underlying study

-   Distorting **axes and scales** to make the data tell a different story

-   Visualizing **spatial areas instead of human density** for issues that depend on and affect humans

-   Omitting **uncertainty** in reporting

## Causality - TIME coverage

-   **Volunteers** were **asked** about their physical activity level over the preceding year.
-   Half exercised less than about 150 minutes per week, half exercised more.
-   Compared to the bottom 10% of exercisers, the top 10% had lower rates of esophageal, liver, lung, endometrial, colon, and breast cancer.
-   Researchers found no association between exercising and 13 other cancers (e.g. pancreatic, ovarian, and brain).

**Data:** Risk scores assigned to \>7,000 people arrested in Broward County, FL + whether they were charged with new crimes over the following 2 years.

. . .

**Results:**

::: incremental
-   20% of those predicted to commit violent crimes actually did.
-   Algorithm had higher accuracy (61%) when full range of crimes taken into account (e.g. misdemeanors). ![](images/14/propublica-results.png)
-   Algorithm was more likely to falsely flag black defendants as future criminals, at almost twice the rate as white defendants.
-   White defendants were mislabeled as low risk more often than black defendants.

How can an algorithm that doesn't use race as input data be racist?

## Predicting ethnicity {.xxsmall}

[Improving Ecological Inference by Predicting Individual Ethnicity from Voter Registration Record](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/race.html) (Imran and Khan, 2016)

> In both political behavior research and voting rights litigation, turnout and vote choice for different racial groups are often inferred using aggregate election results and racial composition.
> Over the past several decades, many statistical methods have been proposed to address this ecological inference problem.
> We propose an alternative method to reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from voter registration records.
> Building on the existing methodological literature, we use Bayes’s rule to combine the Census Bureau’s Surname List with various information from geocoded voter registration records.
> We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using approximately nine million voter registration records from Florida, where self-reported ethnicity is available.
> We find that it is possible to reduce the false positive rate among Black and Latino voters to 6% and 3%, respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate above 80%.
> Moreover, we use our predictions to estimate turnout by race and find that our estimates yields substantially less amounts of bias and root mean squared error than standard ecological inference estimates.
> We provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology.
> The open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology.

## Parting thoughts {.smaller}

- At some point during your data science learning journey you will learn tools that can be used unethically

- You might also be tempted to use your knowledge in a way that is ethically questionable either because of business goals or for the pursuit of further knowledge (or because your boss told you to do so)

::: question
How do you train yourself to make the right decisions (or reduce the likelihood of accidentally making the wrong decisions) at those points?
