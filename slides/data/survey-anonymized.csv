"Yes, I have taken a high school statistics course",A little — I’ve written a few lines or done small exercises,"Java: Pretty comfortable

C++: Used to be super fluent, but pretty rusty now (haven't touched it for a while)

Python: Pretty comfortable, although I learned it through actual experience rather than systematic learning, so I'm very comfortable with a few libraries but might fumble elsewhere

R: Learned it in my stats class last year, somehow became the designated programmer for all project assignments, so I am pretty comfortable with it as well",Team based learning,NA
