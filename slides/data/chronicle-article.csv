The United States is a frat. And I can’t unsee it.,Noor Nazir,2025-10-07T10:00:00Z,Oct,7,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/the-united-states-is-a-frat-and-i-cant-unsee-it-20251007.html,"Fraternities thrive on exclusivity. At Duke, that posture may be tolerable, even expected. But once you’ve seen how Greek life operates (gatekeeping at the door, bending rules for insiders, punishing outsiders) it’s hard not to notice the same logic playing out on a national scale. The United States, too, runs like a frat: immigration represents the rush process, the Constitution and the insiders who decide when those rules apply and when they don’t.The First Test: Do You Belong?Immigration is America’s bid night. Who gets past the door and who gets turned away, reveals who the frat thinks deserves to wear its letters. In the late 1800s, the Chinese Exclusion Act was the ultimate “you don’t belong here.” It was the equivalent of a fraternity cutting pledges at the door, not because of merit, but because of appearance.Historian Andrew Gyory argues in “Closing the Gate: Race, Politics, and the Chinese Exclusion Act,” that the 1882 Chinese Exclusion law wasn’t just about jobs or economics — it was about racial scapegoating weaponized in a crisis. In the recession of the 1870s, white workers blamed Chinese laborers for stealing jobs and depressing wages. Politicians ran with it, branding Chinese immigrants as “coolies” (a slur) who threatened white labor. This act suspended immigration, denied naturalization and subjected exempt merchants and students to humiliating interrogation. The same script is running today. Just as Chinese laborers were scapegoated during the 1870s downturn, today’s immigrants are painted as threats to American workers. Trump says migrants “steal jobs” and “drive down wages,” while ignoring the actual structural causes of inequality. Wealth-based hurdles for H-1B visas, restrictions on asylum work permits: all built on the same assumption that keeping immigrants out will magically protect American jobs. The target changes, but the logic does not: protect the insiders, keep the outsiders desperate.It’s not “No Asians allowed” anymore; it’s “You can only enter if you can pay the toll.” The words have shifted — “merit,” “abuse,” “national security” — but the message hasn’t. Some people belong. Others don’t. Gatekeeping at the border bleeds into gatekeeping the Constitution itself. Once you’re in though, it may not be what you expect it to. Inside the HouseOnce you’re in, the house makes the rules. Fraternities are notorious for setting the tone of how members act, who they associate with and even how they speak. The U.S. works the same way: once you’re past the border, culture and politics dictate what’s acceptable and what’s excused.Trump’s infamous Access Hollywood tape was brushed off as “locker room talk.” Anyone who’s been in a frat knows exactly what that means: a culture where misogyny isn’t condemned; it’s normalized as tradition. And Trump isn’t an outlier. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently scolded generals for being “fat” in the halls of the Pentagon. He said, “It's completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon and leading commands around the country and the world.”What starts as frat culture seeps into governance. The overlap isn’t just metaphorical anymore. It’s literal.The Second Test: Will You Submit?Every frat has rules, but everyone knows they bend when it suits those in charge. National bylaws formally ban hazing and restrict alcohol, yet incidents from Penn State and Bowling Green prove those rules are selectively enforced. They are college kids, not U.S. government officials. So, no. No leeway here. The Constitution is supposed to be America’s house bylaws, but we’re watching them get bent the same way fraternity brothers bend their codes of conduct. The Fifth Amendment says: “No person shall … be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” No person. Not no citizen. Yet under Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, Venezuelan migrants have been deported straight into El Salvador’s prisons — without hearings, charges or convictions. That’s not due process. That’s rule by decree.The First Amendment is also under attack. Student activists like Rümeysa Öztürk have been detained by ICE for nothing more than co-writing an article. Visas revoked, scholars deported — not because of crime, but because of speech. This amendment also doesn’t specify “citizens,” it specifies “the people.”The Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause is hanging by a thread. Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship — blocked in court but revealing in intent — openly defies the guarantee that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States… are citizens.” If the president of the United States feels free to ignore the Constitution’s plain text, what comes next?The Third Test: Will You Stay Silent? I don’t deny a country, or a club, has the right to control its borders or rules. Sovereignty matters. Rules are necessary. But we have slipped into what I call selective constitutionalism: rules enforced for some (Second Amendment) and not others (Fifth Amendment). Viktor Orbán’s Hungary is the case study: elections still happen, but rules are bent until liberal democracy is hollowed out and only the shell remains. A common rebuttal is: “Trump just says things, he doesn’t mean them.” That’s a lie we tell ourselves to stay comfortable. When I say something outrageous, it’s just words. When a president says the same thing, it becomes marching orders. Presidential words are not idle. They are policy.Even when I disagree with a law — like the Second Amendment — I still believe in respecting due process. If Biden abolished gun rights tomorrow by executive order, I would oppose it. Because the process matters. Without it, the rule of law is gone.I use this metaphor because it shouldn’t be foreign to any of us: if you’ve witnessed the selectivism that exists in Greek life at Duke, or seen rules bent to protect a brother, you’ve seen the same logic, when scaled up, applied to our nation's Constitution. What’s tolerable as a flawed college club becomes catastrophic when it defines a nation.When rules are bent long enough, they don’t snap. They disappear. In a frat, that leaves chaos. In a country, it leaves tyranny.Noor Nazir is a Trinity junior. Her columns typically run on alternate Tuesdays. "
The problem with censorship and discourse at Duke,Harrison Walley,2025-10-07T10:00:00Z,Oct,7,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/the-problem-with-censorship-and-discourse-at-duke-20251007.html,"In the wake of the tragic assassination of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration has attempted to crack down on what they consider to be “hate speech.” How the administration defines hate speech is arbitrary, given that United States Attorney General Pam Bondi has backtracked on her promise to “target you… If you are targeting anyone with hate speech.” Less arbitrary than Bondi’s shifting definition is the unconstitutionality of the matter, as, according to the Supreme Court, the government is unable to punish hate speech.It is disturbing to me that the country’s top legal advisor fundamentally misunderstands the First Amendment. The Trump administration is willing to silence political opponents on the left over their speech on the matter, as evidenced by their designation of Antifa (“anti-fascists”) as a terrorist group. Universities are facing intense censorship as well, as the administration attempts to stifle what they perceive as a liberal agenda. In this context, I find it crucial to turn to the question of how censorship actually functions at Duke. In doing so, the path towards meaningful discourse to counter censorship becomes clear.Vocal Republicans at Duke have been quick to call out both the institutional censorship and self-censorship that take place on campus. To their point, there is problematic institutional censorship at Duke. Whether it is purposeful or not, Duke’s faculty leans heavily towards the center-left. Our events frequently feature left-leaning speakers, which is not quite institutional (student and faculty-led organizations host many of the events, rather than Duke itself), but it further highlights the predominance of the left on campus.Institutional censorship poses a challenge for students who dissent from the prevailing views. As many Republicans argue, it also creates a Democratic echo chamber, a metaphorical bubble in which Democrats reinforce their preconceived notions because they face minimal opposition. Such an echo chamber leads to an overall increase in campus polarization, further pushing opinionated students away from dissenting viewpoints. While some students may prefer to live in this echo chamber, it is almost certainly not good for us. Exposure to different perspectives is crucial to fostering a cross-aisle understanding that is currently lacking in this environment created at Duke.Self-censorship is more complicated. We should expect that Republicans, who represent the minority at Duke, are often afraid to speak their minds on campus. I would certainly be hesitant to announce a potentially controversial stance publicly. While self-censorship may sound like it is entirely self-imposed, I would argue otherwise. Self-censorship is a byproduct of a community that is either ostensibly or genuinely intolerant of different perspectives. As such, self-censorship is a reality of campus life at Duke. Though we may anticipate such aversion from a psychological standpoint, it should never be acceptable.While it may seem that Democrats on campus enjoy a lesser degree of censorship than their Republican counterparts, I cannot say that there is no censorship for Democrats on campus. This censorship primarily manifests as self-censorship, but recent rhetoric from the Trump administration also raises alarms. I will be the first to admit that self-censorship among Democrats at Duke likely does not manifest in nearly the same capacity as it does among Republicans at Duke, but it is a problem nevertheless. The more troubling and exigent threat to free speech seems to be a wave of censorship for Democrats that may be coming under the Trump administration, an issue that exacerbates Duke’s already shaky policies on speech on campus. Protests are currently on the chopping block in the wake of anti-Trump and pro-Palestine movements across the nation. Universities have received a list of demands, accompanied by the threat of federal funding freezes for non-compliance. Seemingly fearful of prolonged confrontation, Duke has remained relatively silent in their own battle against these cuts. The long-feared “woke liberal agenda” is being punished, which seems antithetical to the Trump administration’s supposed goal of “ending” censorship. Duke’s inaction — it’s cowardice, even — is making the already unsettling possibility of the curtailment of free speech even more profound.The differences between Republican and Democratic experiences with censorship at Duke are significant, yet these experiences are inextricably linked. It is a shame that, like so many political subjects, censorship has become an opportunity to blame the other party for their encroachment on free speech. This blame-game mentality precludes us from making broader connections. Censorship is censorship, and people from both ends of the political spectrum should be wary of it. The ongoing practice of censorship also makes future censorship more tolerable; therefore, even if the average Duke student is not currently troubled by censorship, they should be aware of its potential to grow under the current administration.As someone who often agrees with the political majority on campus, I still repeatedly find myself fearful to share my opinions. I can only imagine how the political minority on campus feels. Our community, as long as we continuously fear judgment from the other party, will always struggle to address censorship at its roots. Productive discourse is a promising method to counteract censorship, but the current environment is toxically oriented against these kinds of productive conversations.Within this environment, Duke University must act as a protector of free speech and take a hard-line stance against censorship. Universities should be the hubs of free speech, conflicting ideas and the ability to learn from debate. So, as the Trump administration continues to threaten free speech, Duke has an obligation to its students and faculty to actively resist. Although the University should be the primary guardian of free speech, the student body is similarly obligated to defend and exercise our First Amendment Rights. Political groups at Duke designed to spur debate are not doing enough. I expect that the majority of members of the College Republicans at Duke will not, in good faith, interact with the majority of members of the Democrats at Duke in a political capacity. Organizations at Duke should promote genuine dialogue based on listening, rather than arguing. Regularly scheduled roundtables, low-stakes debates and even community-building efforts among ideologically dissimilar groups are crucially lacking at Duke. While institutional censorship may be more difficult to address, we can mitigate self-censorship by making it evident that nobody will be punished for their thoughts. Without a degree of established comfort in sharing our opinions, there will never be a shift away from self-censorship. This is where I find our current debates to be faulty; we listen to the opposing viewpoint to fight, not to learn. It is impossible to believe that we can have effective debates when the sole goal is to intellectually dominate our opponent without regard for the rationale behind their arguments. As long as discourse is incomplete on campus, censorship will always be something that we are forced to accept. With free speech being threatened, voices across campus will be silenced. The rejection of censorship, which begins with the promotion of free speech and open discourse, is vital for the well-being of political life at Duke. The solution to censorship lies in our hands, and I hope that the Duke administration, Duke organizations and Duke students will embrace it. Harrison Walley is a Trinity sophomore.

The 'Duke Difference' we actually need,Gabrielle Mollin,2025-10-06T14:30:00Z,Oct,6,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/the-duke-difference-we-actually-need-20251006.html,"A week ago, hundreds of Duke students filled Page Auditorium to hear Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg speak. He outlined a bright, strategic vision for American politics in the Trump era, but what stuck with me most was his commentary on universities. Embedded in his larger point on the importance of working across ideological divides, Buttigieg hailed universities as ideal locations for this sort of dialogue. He’s right. While many lambast universities (especially private, elite universities like Duke) as glorified breeding grounds for groupthink and conformity, I’ve come to see them as micro communities that simultaneously mirror and resist American political culture. I don’t resist the narrative that universities play an integral role in the polarization we feel as a nation — they do — but I also see a pathway for universities to become the very places where polarization is challenged. Duke students should lead the way. Of all the symptoms of America’s deepening political polarization, one stands out: the lack of exposure to diverse perspectives​​. Americans’ misperceptions on the demographics and policy positions of the opposing party accelerate polarization. In other words, polarization thrives because most Americans rarely encounter people unlike themselves, instead relying on misperceptions and stereotypes to make sense of the other side. Online, we can unfollow or block those with opposing viewpoints.Offline, many of us never leave the communities we grew up in. In fact, polling estimates that 11% of Americans have never left their home state, 54% have visited 10 states or less and 40% have never left the country. Americans’ tendency to remain within the comfort of like-minded communities has fueled a national crisis — but it presents an opportunity for Duke. We can combat polarization by ""actively pursuing learning"" outside our social network. Few environments are better suited to this than a college campus, especially one like Duke. With representation from every state, 87 nations and 22% of students eligible for Pell Grants, Duke’s Class of 2028 points to progress in broadening campus perspectives, even as questions remain about how far such measures go in reshaping the student experience. And while campus may overrepresent the left, students still have the chance to engage with people of different backgrounds in ways most Americans rarely can.Beyond demographics, Duke’s community is privileged with access to various speaker events across the political spectrum, a magazine committed to civil discourse and even a formal Provost’s Initiative on Pluralism, Free Inquiry and Belonging. As a student here, you have the opportunity to engage with so many people who may not share the same values or politics as you. That opportunity is a stark contrast to the way most Americans live and we shouldn’t waste it. I say all of this not to praise Duke for its commitment to diversity and free speech on campus (which has a long way to go), but to remind students that the difficult task of expanding your worldview will never be as easy as it can be here at Duke. Few spaces beyond this campus offer a chance to live and learn among people of such depth and diversity. Duke’s greatest resource isn’t just its name, its funding or its alumni network; it’s the people. Even if it feels like many students came from the same Northeast boarding school or almost everyone leans left, there is always something, or someone, new to hear. Even the most connected student on campus likely still has people they can learn from. So, I challenge Duke to make the “Duke Difference” more than just a comedic slogan. Let’s push back on the narrative that universities promote political censorship and virtue signaling. Instead, let’s prove we can create a culture of curiosity and care for the differences of people around us. Whether that looks like reaching out to a classmate who shared something we disagreed with or stepping into campus spaces we rarely inhabit, we should strive to make the most of what Duke has to offer by authentically engaging its students. We don’t have to give in to the polarization and culture war that engulfs our national politics; we can attempt to create our own campus culture where people look beyond themselves and their closest circles. We won’t fully eliminate disagreement, nor should we. But we can learn, grow and form a better community outcome than the ease of sameness that undermines American culture. Duke sets us up to do this, and our nation needs us to want it. If we fail to rise to that challenge, we’ll waste one of the best opportunities a university like Duke has to offer.Gabrielle Mollin is a Trinity senior.

Death ain’t nothin’ but a robber,Luke A. Powery,2025-10-06T10:00:00Z,Oct,6,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/death-aint-nothin-but-a-robber-20251006.html,"Some phone calls you never forget. I was 13 years old when I received a call from a friend about another friend. We were all around the same age. His first words were: “Luke, Susan is dead. Susan is dead.” That was 38 years ago, yet I still remember it. Why would I ever want to forget? Death is on my mind because, once again, it has pierced my heart. A friend, colleague, scholar, professor, musician and Black sacred music guru, Dr. W. James Abbington, recently died. He was recently appointed as the first Joseph B. Bethea Chair in Black Church Studies at Duke Divinity School, after having served for many years as a professor at Emory University. Dr. Abbington is the most recent instance of someone I knew well and loved who has, as a spiritual says, met “the robber.” The news of any death is a stirring reminder of all the deaths of loved ones we’ve experienced over time. I’m sure you know people, or people who know people, who have died as well. We’re connected — whether we like it or not — through the experience of death. Perhaps a friend, a family member, a neighbor, a work colleague or a classmate is no longer here on Earth. Death touches all of us. As surgeon Atul Gawande writes in his eloquent book “Being Mortal,” “Death, of course, is not a failure. Death is normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things.” Death is ubiquitous, so get used to it. In his autobiography, “With Head and Heart,” the Rev. Howard Thurman begins with an experience he had after his first year in seminary. He was a 24-year-old assistant to the pastor at First Baptist Church of Roanoke, VA, and felt an “ambivalence” about his life and calling. While the church’s pastor, Dr. James, was on vacation, Thurman was thrust into a situation in which a dying man needed pastoral care. On his first night on duty alone, the head nurse of a local hospital called the parsonage looking for Dr. James. She asked Thurman, “Are you a minister?” because the dying man was looking for one. Despite his hesitancy, Thurman replied, “Yes, I am a minister.” He arrived at the hospital, and after he prayed with the man at his bedside and the man thanked him, Thurman said, “He died with his hand in mine.” This experience touched Thurman so much that he chose to frame his life story, his autobiography, through this lens. Maybe he wants the reader to get a glimpse of just how close we all are to death and dying. Through this lens of mortality and death, I encourage people to plan their funerals or memorial services ahead of time. Choose the songs you would like sung, the music you desire to be played and who you want to speak. My friend and colleague, Sanyin Siang, executive director of the Coach K Center on Leadership and Ethics at Duke’s Fuqua School of Business, encourages others to write their own obituaries as an exercise in self-reflection on how they want to be remembered as a person. These practices — planning your funeral and writing your obituary — are helpful, constructive ways to face death and your mortality head-on.Because death is inevitable and we are touched by it in so many ways as human beings, you may hear conversations about how to die well. This is important and good. But, also critical in the face of death, is to ponder how to live well, even today.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel.

Hazing ban forces Greek life leaders to get creative,Monday Monday,2025-10-06T04:00:00Z,Oct,6,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/hazing-ban-forces-greek-life-leaders-to-get-creative-20251006.html,"Editor's note: The piece below is satire.Last week, Duke updated its hazing policy, expanding protections for its students in the way that it normally does: when forced to be in compliance with federal law. In a recent statement to student organizations, Duke University President Vincent Price said in an Instagram story, “oh my god i'm cryinggg, y'all do too muchh, actually stop this time fr tho 😭😭😭”. Despite this, not all students are ready to adhere to the new policies.This isn’t the first time that Duke has made student organizations into potential enemies; Whitney Pink, president of Durham’s Sigma Delta Kappa sorority, told me, “The first straw was Duke saying we couldn’t use the paper bag test to admit new members anymo- oh, you were talking about disaffiliation? Yeah, that was also messed up. Not letting freshmen rush goes against our values; no matter your grade, if you love SDK, you can be a Sigma. The BMI thing is just a formality.” Pink wouldn’t elaborate on what she meant here.The new hazing policies have taken many by surprise. SDK’s rush chair, Clawdia White, told me, “I mean, it’s not like we can just stop hazing them… So we’ve had to change how we do rush this year. Life hack — just keep the pledges in the house basement during rush and don’t let the ones who aren’t having fun leave.”As of writing this article, The Chronicle has been made aware of at least three different student organizations following White’s rush format. Rush at Durham’s Alpha Gamma (AG) fraternity house has pledges take shots until they meet the criteria for legal blindness and then puts them in a boxing match à la Fight Club. “Hazing gets a bad rap, but it’s honestly what turns pledges into brothers — and young men need brothers now more than ever. Those policies wouldn’t have happened if Duke thought men’s mental health matters,” Bruce Ski, president of AG, tells me as we watch a freshman pass out in his own vomit, “Wait, guess what you think the first time most men receive flowers is.”Other community leaders are already looking at innovative solutions to adapt to the new guidelines that help deconstruct fraternity hazing’s reputation of toxic masculinity and insularity. Durham’s Lambda Pi chapter, in collaboration with four other “Durham” Greek Life organizations, released a statement yesterday saying, “In light of the new hazing policies, our new rush events will have pledges write analyses of the works of the incomparable Angela Davis.” Lambda Pi’s president, Mike Shard, told our sources, “The reason you’ll see student organizations taking these policies so seriously is because they have a reputation to uphold. The idea of a fraternity engaging in illegal activity is unthinkable. The last thing we would want to do is not stop when someone says no over and over again.”Finally, I spoke to an anonymous Duke official, who said, “At least people will go to QuadEX stuff now, so that’s cool.” However, in the interest of honest reporting, it should be noted that The Chronicle’s fact-checkers determined this claim to be false. Monday Monday is back and is busy verifying claims against hazing by frequenting every frat house for “research purposes.”"
Duke’s hold on Durham,Lucas Barilovits,2025-10-04T10:00:00Z,Oct,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/dukes-hold-on-durham-20251004.html,"Duke is undeniably one of the top universities in the world and a leader in life-saving research that boasts billions in endowment. Duke donates millions to charity and flaunts a carefully curated image of community partnership; In 2023, Duke paraded “nearly $24 million” in community contributions. That sounds amazing, yet Duke controls over $787 million in assessed property (about 2% of the county and 3% of the city).As a nonprofit, most of that is exempt — hence Duke paid $2 million in property taxes in 2024 versus the $11 million they would pay if taxable (and that, even, is a low-end estimate, according to Durham county officials). Duke consistently profits from its historical power and non-profit status. By sheltering its wealth behind nonprofit status, Duke saves millions that would otherwise support Durham’s public schools and other services - profits for the university, and more losses for the city’s poorest residents.This Duke-Durham gap is not simply a result of Duke's neglect. Rather, it’s exploitation framed as philanthropy. Duke has crushed Durham for generations by reinforcing redlining, aligning with the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) and sustaining local slave owning dynasties. In the 19th century, Durham became a hotspot for tobacco farms and slave plantations due to its rich soil, climate and central location. In the 1910s, wealthy white Duke faculty started congregating around what is now East Campus in northwest Durham, away from the poorer minorities who lived primarily in southeastern Durham — the start of the ivory tower. In 1924-25, the beginning of the creation of Duke's modern map started with the West Campus land purchases. The university used a shadow real-estate agent, hiding to keep prices low and avoid community backlash against another white-only expansion, to quietly assemble roughly 60 properties. J.B. Duke even threatened to move the college to Charlotte if the deals lagged. Dr. Pauli Murray — a Black scholar and Durham native — described her own hometown as one of “rigid legal segregation.” Starting in 1925, white Durham real estate tycoons, using racist but legal deeds and zoning restrictions, continued to segregate Durham. In 1926, a deed was published for Hope Valley, outlining the rules for the block.The seventh rule? “The premises shall not be occupied by negroes or persons with negro blood; provided that this shall not be construed to prevent the living upon the premises of any negro servant whose time is employed for domestic purposes by the occupants of the dwelling house, together with the family of such servant” (Bull City 150). So, who lived in this exclusive area, which was later recognized as a first-grade “A” level block by the HOLC in 1937? Durham’s own oligarchy of slave owners; and wealthy white Duke faculty. When federal graders mapped Durham in 1937, an area by the future West Campus scored an A in part for the ""presence of physicians"" there, while historically Black neighborhoods like Hayti were redlined as ""hazardous."" If you go to Hope Valley today, who will you run into? Duke faculty, still profiting on the racism set forth for them by the Duke faculty 100 years ago, with the help of HOLC and previous slave owners. These effects continue today; from 2014–2019, Black residents were ~37% of Durham’s population but 69% of jail admissions and 78% of occupied bed-days — disparities rooted in the very lines Duke helped draw a century ago (deed restrictions, redlining and campus land deals) that are still touted as what ‘keeps us safe’ today. Duke’s expansion reinforced the already radical racial exclusion. Whatever the intent, the outcomes cannot be disputed: the records show exclusionary maps, restrictive covenants, tax-sheltered growth and neighborhood displacement.21st century Duke continued to honor open white supremacy for almost two decades: Duke’s East Campus Carr Building honored Julian S. Carr, who infamously bragged in 1913 about whipping a Black woman at a Confederate monument dedication — until trustees removed his name in 2018. If the point was progression, why name the building ‘Classroom Building’? Name it instead for Pauli Murray, Durham’s own black civil-rights lawyer and writer, or another Black Durham historical figure. Say, clearly, what and who you want to represent, rather than just burying your shameful racist past. Duke does not need to keep hiding from its history. What it needs is to give back what it took from the people of Durham: equitable housing and schools, fair wages and real partnerships with the people it displaced. Duke may not have started the drowning in abuse of black people and other minorities in North Carolina, but it has been the rope tied to their ankles for the last 100 years. Duke has massive tax exemptions and could easily donate PILOTs to differing aspects of Durham’s economy — housing, DPS, rehabilitation centers, etc. — and pay traditional income tax. Yet they choose not to do so.Duke, what is more important to you, your endless wallet continuing to expand, or trying to rebuild the community you helped destroy?

The world needs more Jane Goodalls,Leo Goldberg,2025-10-03T10:00:00Z,Oct,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/the-world-needs-more-jane-goodalls-20251003.html,"Recently, I was surprised to find myself so profoundly affected by the death of someone I have never met. On Wednesday, October 1st, it was announced that Jane Goodall, the iconic British primatologist and conservationist who inspired millions, passed away at age 91. With the departure of Goodall, who dedicated her life to studying, protecting and advancing public knowledge of chimpanzees, the world has lost a truly extraordinary and monumental human being. Rarely has there been an individual who has contributed as much to advance a particular field of study, while simultaneously serving humanity with as much wit, grace and humility.Goodall is someone I have personally admired for years. As a kid, I distinctly remember watching a famous video of her and a team of experts releasing a chimpanzee named Wounda back into the wild after nursing it back to health.Upon being released, Wounda emerged from her cage and took in her surroundings. She is momentarily overwhelmed, quickly realizing the time has come to return to her natural habitat. Before departing, though, she turns to Goodall. In one of the most remarkable moments ever recorded in nature, she lurches forward and embraces Goodall in an emotional and heartfelt hug. In that instant, the boundary between human and animal seems to disappear.Goodall was a person who possessed an uncommon dedication to improving the conditions of humans and animals alike. She was an unrelenting proponent of the truth through enlightenment and discovery, and advanced the notions of empathy and curiosity without the slightest air of sappiness or superiority. Her soul was one of the few in this world that was truly incorruptible. It is for that reason that her death matters so greatly.At the risk of sounding fatalistic or cliché, we live in a world that is deeply and increasingly cynical. More and more, positions of power across the world are being filled by careless, narcissistic, self-aggrandizing individuals. The disregard for decency, human life and mutual respect has become standard practice. In our own country, those with power, politically and economically, Republican and Democrat, gleefully treat masses of ordinary people as raw material in order to gain greater power and save face. Admittedly, I, too, write far more pessimistic opinion pieces than optimistic ones. It is much easier, after all, to complain about what is wrong than to exalt what is right. Perhaps it is the job of opinion columnists and journalists to criticize the world in this way, but it is also imperative, every once in a while, to honor that which is good. Goodall began her career out of a genuine desire to learn more about the world and carried with her an insatiable curiosity throughout. She did so always in the spirit of advancing the wonders of science, to which we owe so much in our society. Shamefully, that spirit is being actively undermined today. As we speak, there is a concerted campaign from the venal, mindless leaders of our country to disregard and discredit science. The press conference held a couple of weeks ago by our president and his festering polyp of a health secretary, which spewed the most egregious nonsense about medicine and autism, is just the most recent example. Greater and greater numbers of Americans are willing to discard skepticism and science for junk theories and pseudo-science, which provide easy explanations to complicated problems. Ignorance is being glorified while empirical research is being dismantled. Goodall, more than anything, illustrated the glories of science and its potential to improve our world, and emphasized that our lack of knowledge offers the humbling opportunity to discover. It was through this emphasis and public advocacy that countless children were inspired to pursue scientific fields. Goodall’s intellectual inquisitiveness about the world is a legacy too important to abandon, and we cannot concede the arena of public figures to those who discourage and belittle science, all the while risking jeopardizing an entire future generation of young scientists.While originally beginning her career with the strict purpose of studying the behavior of chimpanzees, Goodall eventually expanded her mission to include the protection of the natural world, too. As the Jane Goodall Institute remarked, she “went into the forest to study the remarkable lives of chimpanzees — and she came out of the forest to save them.” Having spent virtually her whole career immersed deep in nature, Goodall witnessed first-hand the horrors of poaching, deforestation and other forms of environmental destruction.As our news cycle has become inundated with a constant flood of crises, from government shutdowns, to genocide and war, we collectively seem to have forgotten (perhaps in a deliberately engineered fashion) that there is a global environmental catastrophe occurring as we speak. Entire ecosystems are being destroyed, species are being wiped out and large swathes of the Earth are being rendered uninhabitable by abnormal, human-induced climactic shifts. As this happens, our self-absorbed leaders once again trash the Earth for their own gain, encouraging further drilling and environmental degradation while arrogantly denying the existence of human-caused climate change at all. If there is one thing Goodall taught us, it is that humans have no right to destroy the Earth they share with thousands of other species.Most amazing of all, though, is the way Goodall managed to empower our humanity by reinforcing the idea of our kinship with other animals. Her work with chimpanzees was revolutionary in discovering that we are much closer to apes than we originally thought. Chimps craft tools, communicate, fight and express emotions in a remarkably similar fashion to humans, and such observations vastly emboldened the idea of the equal, rather than hegemonic, position we occupy in relation to other animals. It is a wonderfully humbling thing to think about. Forget being created in the image of God, or endowed with original sin. We humans are, at the end of the day, an imperfectly evolved species of primate who share 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees. We possess similar deficiencies to our fellow primates in dealing with conflict, regulating emotions and properly upholding our obligations to one another and to other creatures. We anger too easily, disregard the humanity of those we deem different and prefer revenge and distrust to forgiveness and solidarity. At the same time, we possess immense capacities for wonder, love, excitement and discovery. We are moved by art and music, bond intensely with friends and loved ones and are enthralled when we learn new information. It is an incredible thing, as Goodall illustrated, to recognize this innate imperfection that we share with every other species, and to know that the only truly reliable means we have of dealing with such a condition is to embrace a shared humanity and constantly seek ways to collectively improve ourselves, all while knowing we are bound to make mistakes in doing so. In Goodall’s absence, upholding such an idea is the least we can do to live up to the monumental legacy she left us. No human is better than any other human, or animal, which is ultimately what we are, and we would do well to honor Goodall by remembering our inseparable and obligatory connection to the miraculous world we have the privilege of sharing with millions of other creatures.

We’ve grown the future of botany here. Why are we cutting its roots?,Kaylee McKinzie,2025-10-02T14:00:00Z,Oct,2,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/weve-grown-the-future-of-botany-here-20251002.html,"As a Duke undergraduate who took Bio 347L, Plants and People, in spring 2024, I witnessed firsthand the shock and devastation of my professors, Dr. Kathleen Pryer and Dr. Michael Windham, when the University announced it would be closing its 100-year-old herbarium.The news came as an email to Dr. Pryer just before class started. Her normally cheerful demeanor was visibly transformed when she shared the news with the class: “Remember our excursion to the Duke herbarium in last week’s lab? Well, Duke now wants to be rid of it.” Witnessing our professors experience institutional betrayal in real time is a moment I’ll never forget.On our herbarium class visit, we had hands-on experience with specimens collected over 200 years ago. We learned how plant knowledge connects to human uses and discovered the importance of voucher specimens for scientific studies. We saw how herbaria serve as libraries of plant diversity and play a crucial role in documenting disappearing ecosystems. A local high school student showed us how she was using historical herbarium data in a climate change study. She demonstrated that because of warming winters, the pink lady’s slipper orchid, Cypripedium acaule, was flowering at least two weeks earlier now in North Carolina than it was 150 years ago.Finally, we oohed and aahed over original type specimens used to describe a new fern genus (Gaga) honoring Lady Gaga and marveled at how these dried plant specimens yield secrets about plant evolution through their DNA using modern molecular techniques.Why was Duke suddenly no longer interested in providing a safe home for these irreplaceable scientific resources? Why had this decision been made without faculty input and then described as strictly financial? If Duke can so casually dispense of a century-old herbarium, what other “inconvenient” academic resources are at risk?For my gap year, before applying to medical school, I have been interning in the herbarium because staff numbers have been cut and there is no one to help return dozens of research loans to their home institutions before the divestment. Matthew CicaneseRow of cabinets housing over 825,000 specimens inside the Duke Herbarium.In July, I attended the Botany 2025 annual conference in Palm Springs, the premier international gathering for botanical science, where groundbreaking research and visionary leadership are showcased each year. As an “amateur botanist,” I presented a talk about how I have become involved in social media storytelling to transform pending institutional loss into a public engagement opportunity, as part of a project led by Art History professor Dr. Andrew Griebeler.At the Botany 2025 conference final awards ceremony, as the emcee cycled through this year's top awards, I had a jarring moment of realization: every single one of the big award winners shared a common thread.The “Emerging Leader Award” of the Botanical Society of America, which honors creative and influential scholarship, went to Dr. Fay-Wei Li (Graduate School '15), who is currently at Cornell’s Boyce Thompson Institute and will return to Duke in 2026 as a new biology faculty member.The “Asa Gray Award”, the highest honor bestowed by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists, went to Dr. Charlotte Taylor (Graduate School '87), a curator at the Missouri Botanical Garden who has described more than 500 new plant species.The “Peter Raven Award” for outstanding contributions to public outreach and science communication went to Dr. W. John Kress (Graduate School '81), curator emeritus at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History.The common thread in all of these? … Duke and its sustained excellence in botany.As if that weren’t enough, the colloquium that anchored this year’s conference — “Defining Forces in Fern Evolution” — celebrated Dr. Kathleen Pryer and Dr. Michael Windham, Duke professors and current curators of the Duke Herbarium, for their revolutionary contributions to fern biology.Duke isn’t just part of the story of botany. Duke is the story of botany.As a recent Duke Bio graduate attending my first scientific conference, I sat there ashamed that the global scientific community is watching Duke destroy its own legacy — effectively gutting the soul of our botany program by dispersing more than 800,000 specimens and erasing a century of research on biodiversity and climate change carried out right here on campus. The same herbarium that trained this year's most prestigious botanical award winners is being reduced to a budget line item. And still, Duke has offered no clear timeline for divestment. Given the current political and financial situation — it is likely that the herbarium will be warehoused, making the collection inaccessible to the public and eliminating its role as a resource for teaching and research.This outcome exposes a profound failure of institutional leadership: Duke’s administration has provided neither vision nor accountability in stewarding one of its most valuable scientific resources. By contrast, when Stanford made the controversial decision to divest from its herbarium in the 1970’s — a move still considered a black mark on the institution — it at least conducted with scientific integrity. Stanford arranged for the 850,000 specimens at its Dudley Herbarium to be housed at the California Academy of Sciences over a 10-year period, raised funds to support the transfer and ensured that the collection remained accessible to researchers and the public. Duke has offered no such assurances, making its decision appear not just shortsighted, but careless.The extraordinary nature of Duke's decision is reflected in the outrage and dismay with which it was met by natural science leaders from around the world and by Duke's own community. Within days of the closure decision, a petition gathered thousands of signatures from students, faculty and community members urging Duke to recognize the herbarium’s irreplaceable value. The administration’s refusal to engage with this outrage underscored just how little weight was given to voices outside its financial calculus. The irony is that the amount of money required to sustain the herbarium is modest compared to Duke’s overall operating budget. The annual costs of staffing and maintaining the collection pales in comparison to what the University routinely devotes to athletics, marketing, or administrative growth. Duke has chosen to cut back in the wrong areas — a choice characterized by the same kind of top-down decision-making we’ve seen recently, where faculty and student concerns were disregarded in favor of unilateral administrative action.Herbaria are becoming even more valuable with modern scientific tools — not less. These collections contain vital data sources for studying biodiversity, climate change and even genomics. Institutions that fail to safeguard these collections risk discarding resources whose importance only grows with time.Future botanists will examine Duke's herbarium closure not as a case study in “financial necessity”, but as a cautionary tale about institutions that forgot why they existed — much as Stanford’s abandoned herbarium has long stood as a reminder of how divestment decisions can tarnish a university’s reputation. That warning has already echoed far beyond Duke, with headlines featured in the Washington Post, New York Times, Science and more.The Botany 2025 stage was a celebration of Duke’s legacy. But legacy isn’t just what we inherit — it’s what we choose to protect and carry on. Why withdraw support for one of the University’s most irreplaceable scientific resources — especially without faculty input — and distort the facts about the actual costs? This decision reflects a troubling trend of Duke’s business operations increasingly driving academic decisions at the expense of its educational mission. I believe it is our responsibility to say clearly: we’ve grown the future of botany here. Let’s not cut its roots now.Kaylee McKinzie (T'25) was a biology major at Duke."
How Duke introduces you to Duke,Neel Dutta Gupta,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,Oct,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/how-duke-introduces-you-to-duke-20251001.html,"Coming to college, a lot worried me. I was two years out of high school, having forgotten most of my calculus and inorganic chemistry, and I was nervous about being thrown into an environment as rigorous as Duke. But I carried a quiet optimism that this would work itself out — that the studies would come with time. What worried me more than classes, was the possibility that I might not make friends. I don’t know if that’s a universal fear, but it certainly was mine.Now, I’m lucky to have a good group of friends I can rely on — in crisis, in humor and in all that I need. But the transition from worry to comfort isn’t something I can trace to a single instant. It wasn’t a sudden switch from black to white; it was a gradient that deepened across the year.A month ago, I had the opportunity to be an Orientation Leader (OL) for Project Play (the best experiential orientation program at Duke). A good number of my kids on the project asked me how I made friends during my first year. I didn’t have a perfect answer. I’d mention clubs and other activities, but never really had a good idea. Through orientation week, and even afterward, I kept turning the question over.On the surface, it sounds simple: where did I meet the people I’m close to today? I thought about it for a while, even through the first few weeks of school, and eventually I settled on an answer: walking.With that answer, the question shifted from a casual curiosity into something more layered. I realized that the majority of my friendships formed through my movements around campus — by passing people. Chance interactions became conversations, which became lunches, which became friendships. But these moments weren’t purely chance; they were nudged into action by intentional choices Duke has made — paths that cross, spaces that invite conversation, routes that make it easy to see the same faces again.Let’s begin with the first-year experience. First-years live on East Campus, but take the majority of their classes on West. The campus is also exclusively for first-year students, apart from the occasional upperclass RA. Duke creates common lived experiences on East to cultivate friendships as students begin to settle in. Marketplace offers daily meals, with large tables and stalls lending itself to lengthy conversation. Its setup is intentional as well, with high visibility throughout its premises. Running into someone you know is inevitable as chances are that you guys will both be standing in line together at Durham market. The C1, annoying as it is, works toward the same goal. For 15 to 30 minutes, a big slice of the class is crammed into one bus, turning a commute into an impromptu common room. In a sense, you're forced to talk to the person next to you; many of my friends came from simply introducing myself to the person next to me on the C1. Routines begin, plans materialize and you begin to recognize the regulars and the 10:05 a.m. rush. As the year progresses, the rides begin to feel less like wasted time and more like a daily ritual. As we move to West, a lot of the same ideas carry through. Take West Union (WU): it’s a dining hall not really designed for dining. The options are great (there’s a reason Duke shows up in the food rankings) and the space looks good, with high tables, big windows and aesthetic lighting. But there isn’t enough seating for the number of students trying to eat. So we end up mindlessly roaming the premises in an effort to find a seat, creating more of those chance run-ins and pushing overflow outside — straight onto BC Plaza. The bottleneck is annoying, but it keeps everyone visible and in motion.BC Plaza is Duke’s heart: the highest density of friends you’ll see in one place, and on a warm Friday afternoon there’s nowhere else I would rather be. You pass through on the way to almost everything, so you’re bound to bump into someone you know. Clubs are tabling, people are eating, someone’s running a performative male competition and you get pulled into a five-minute chat that becomes lunch. Passing periods turn into mini-reunions; the plaza works like a cycle that keeps feeding you back into the day with one more plan than you had before.In the end, none of this feels accidental. East teaches you what it means to be part of a class — Marketplace lines, C1 rides and late-night walks, making familiarity routine. West keeps that rhythm going: WU roams, BC Plaza walks, and the steady traffic between buildings turns logistics into a pattern of quick hellos and five-minute catch-ups. The design nudges you into visibility, and visibility becomes a habit.What starts as a split campus becomes a single community built in the in-between. You come for classes on West and a home on East, but you stay for the small, repeating moments that stitch the day together — seeing the same faces, feeling like you belong before you notice when it happened.With this in mind, I know how I’ll answer students during O-Week: the best way to make friends at Duke is to be present. Walk the routes, wait in the lines, pass through BC Plaza, stay long enough to say hello even if it makes you late for class. Do what you normally do and the campus will take care of the rest. Most of all, don’t stay in your room; Duke does not work unless you do. Neel Dutta Gupta is a Pratt sophomore."
Why aren’t we all excited to do service?,Ryan Growney,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,Oct,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/why-arent-we-all-excited-to-do-service-20251001.html,"The excitement in the freshman class these first few weeks has been palpable. Each and every person I’ve met has been literally bursting at the seams, sacrificing sleep schedules, pouring hours into conversation and work, signing up for more clubs than you can count on two hands (guilty!). Of course they are: Duke offers a breadth and depth of opportunities to connect and learn far beyond anything most of us have ever experienced. On the bus, walking through the quad, sitting in the dining halls, I’ve heard talk about what is possible — sports, music, research opportunities, preprofessional clubs, career fairs — and everything else you could be excited for. Except, there is one conspicuous hole: service.I have spent a lot of time thinking about service. I went to high school with a talented, curious, passionate group of people, not unlike the Duke community. They had skills: there were coders, authors and talented orators. They had resources: time, a computer, a car, a connection. They had ambitions, a drive to “do” something, make a difference, engage with the important challenges in ways that they could feel valued and grow. At the same time, like many other high schools, mine failed at service. Once a year, we had “day of service” picking up trash at the local beach. It taught us little about the broken systems that resulted in this mess, much less how we could apply ourselves to meaningfully fix it. This didn’t even begin to touch on any of the hundreds of other social or economic challenges that desperately need our attention. My classmates wanted to develop their skills, challenge their perspectives and experience and ideas, but they didn’t know how. There was no pathway towards engaging either our moral ambitions or our professional ones.In a way it makes sense: effective service is hard. It requires grappling with complex social, economic and environmental challenges. It means working across a myriad of programs, each focused on their own role in solving knots of interconnected issues and consequences. It ties together actors across an entire system, identifying and connecting thoughtful solutions and iterating over them to mitigate consequences and address root causes. But that is exactly what my classmates and I wanted. Real service, just like research or starting a company or even passing your midterms, is hard — and that is exactly why it is worth it.It’s time that we, students at Duke, realize that service is a pathway to our goals.It’s time we all let Duke help find or build a service opportunity that can help us achieve our goals. It’s not that Duke doesn’t offer opportunities to do so — on the contrary, there are a number of incredible programs, classes and more that connect us to meaningful skills, experiences and resources. DukeEngage, for example, offers programs across the world, working with local organizations and people doing meaningful work in their communities. Each one ties directly with skills and experiences invaluable to those aspiring towards particular fields. One of the first programs you see navigating to the directory is “Displacement, Dispossession, Population Movement,” where, last year, students interested in Pre-Law, Public Policy and Political Science got to work on the ground to “support asylum cases, advocacy campaigns, access to urban housing and land and a host of other services.” Service-learning classes are no exception, spanning topics from languages to life sciences to engineering to policy. ECON 337S, Social Inequalities and Low-Wage Work, is a perfect example of this. The class focuses on “collaborating with community partners to determine and apply programs for improving the conditions of low-wage workers in Durham,” having students apply the skills they’ve learned to evaluate real-world programs. This class and others give students the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to local organizations and communities while also learning about and engaging with the systems they’re studying in dynamic real-world situations.The Duke Community Affairs Office even has a website called the Partnership Platform, where a digital map exists, covered in vibrant pins that each represent a partner organization in one of dozens of initiatives tackling issues from health to housing to employment to education.All of these opportunities are just that — opportunities. They are spaces for growth, passion, skill acquisition, connection, networking, learning in any situation or area or topic under the sun. So where’s the excitement?The answer to that question is endlessly multifaceted, but I believe the brunt of it stems from a simple misconception. What made my classmates in high school brush off service was that they thought it was something inherently altruistic. They understood service to be something done out of the goodness of our hearts, a valuable resource for others. Even the words we used, “giving back” or “charity,” imply that we are parting with something, losing something we had, with no reciprocal value. The reason we all aren’t excited to do service is because, under this misconception, it isn’t something to be excited about. It is just work to do. I am glad to announce that this is patently untrue.We live in a time where contemporary ideas and technologies enable each of us to shift systems at each of the local, regional and national levels. Our power to tackle social, economic and environmental problems at a global scale is far greater than it ever has been before. When we reach beyond our misconceptions, we can see that this is what service truly is. If there is anything that’s true about the Duke community, it is that we are some of the most skilled, passionate, resourceful, driven people the world has to offer. We, more than almost anybody, have an incredible chance to grapple with, learn about and grow from an evergreen space where intellect, talent, curiosity and ambition can be meaningfully applied today.We each have the rare chance to ask where we want to apply ourselves and our resources for the maximum personal and career growth; we must ask how we want to direct our energy to create the largest possible impact in the world.As we ask ourselves this question in our time at Duke and beyond, we must remember that service is just as powerful an answer as any other.Ryan Growney is a Trinity first-year.

ChatGPT and the environment: Where do we draw the line?,Samantha George,2025-09-29T10:00:00Z,Sep,29,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/chatgpt-and-the-environment-where-do-we-draw-the-line-20250929.html,"These days, you can’t go anywhere without running into AI. With Duke’s recent rollout of its own LLM service (DukeGPT) and free access to ChatGPT to all undergraduate students, the use of AI has been a hot topic on campus. Some of my friends are all for using it, asking ""Chat"" to write up emails or summarize readings. Others use it in less academic manners, searching up recipes or movie recommendations. And some won’t touch ChatGPT with a ten-foot pole.Almost equal to its celebration of AI, Duke has also heavily publicized its Climate Commitment in the past few years, which highlights the University’s dedication to address “the climate challenge with true impact through innovations in education, research, sustainable operations” and to create “sustainable actions that place society on the path toward a resilient, flourishing net-zero world for all.”Personally, I’m no expert in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Coming to conclusions regarding ChatGPT’s accuracy or impacts on our health, like lowering cognitive ability, is certainly beyond my reach. But I am a senior who has spent four years studying in the Nicholas School of the Environment. And recently, as I was sitting in an ecology lecture listening to my professor repeatedly encouraging us to use ChatGPT to complete our assignments, I found myself looking left and right to see if anyone else could sense the growing elephant in the room. Should a school for the environment be promoting the use of AI, a technology known to consume precious resources at vastly high rates? Should a university boasting sustainability and carbon neutrality be encouraging the use of AI at all?The environmental impacts of LLMs, like ChatGPT, are often thrown into the ring in the “to use or not to use” debates. Like that one vegan friend, pledging abstinence due to environmental concerns seems logical. However, the actual details, numbers and direct line between cause and effect, often grow hazy and fizzle out in actual discussion. Nonetheless, since its inception, there’s been an increasing awareness of the dire environmental consequences of ChatGPT, and rightfully so. The power needed to train AI models requires a staggering amount of electricity, increasing demand on our electric grids and increasing carbon dioxide emissions. And the energy demands don’t stop once the model is trained — researchers estimate that each time a model is used, say asking ChatGPT to summarize an email, the command requires five times more electricity than a simple web search. In addition to its electricity demand, AI technology also depletes water resources. While we often think of the software we use as existing in “clouds,” physical data centers power the tech we log onto daily — like ChatGPT — and cold water is used to cool these data centers by absorbing heat from the computing equipment. It’s estimated that two liters of water is needed to cool equipment for every kilowatt hour of energy a data center consumes. Things quickly go from bad to worse when we consider that many of these data centers are located in the south, where water availability is often already a battle. ChatGPT, for example, is hosted in a Microsoft Azure data center in San Antonio, Texas, which has seen drought conditions since 2022.And to really pile on the bad news, extracting the materials needed to maintain AI hardware also often involves mining rare earth metals, like lithium and cobalt, which requires significant water usage and can lead to pollution and environmental degradation; not to mention the human rights violations and poor labor conditions which are often linked to the extraction of these minerals.But I’m not afraid to acknowledge that AI has been used to help the environment, too, by being able to model and predict the impacts of climate change faster than we would ever be able to. The United Nations Environment Program, in particular, has been using AI to monitor methane emissions and track air quality, increasing the speed and scale at which we are able to process data and act on environmental health issues. So, where do we draw the line?When do environmental ethics outweigh convenience and advancement? For me, the fact that our University’s use of ChatGPT applies mostly to things we can typically do on our own quickly defeats the campaign to adopt it fully. Although it may take longer and be more of a pain, we can write our own code, draft our own emails, take our own notes and go back to good old Google searches. We might even be better for it in the long run. It’s impossible to avoid all environmental hypocrisies, but committing some environmental sins doesn’t mean you should give up and give in to them all. I own an iPhone, I fly on airplanes and, every now and then, I enjoy a good burger. But using ChatGPT, a piece of technology known to consume lots of environmental resources with potential impacts on my ability to think critically and creatively — just to save some time on assignments — that’s where I draw the line.The popularity of ChatGPT also offers Duke the perfect opportunity to show its true commitment to the climate. Rather than flashing DukeGPT and ChatGPT promotions on TVs across campus, the University should educate its students on the true costs of the technology and encourage the use of search engines that consume fewer resources. If Duke really cares about our environment, the environment should be included in the conversation.So, I can understand a professor’s desire to adopt new technology, but as I watch ChatGPT fill the screens of students in front of me, I can’t help but grow wary. I’m all for advancement, but sometimes we have to look around the corner and see that some things are really too good to be true. We can’t let AI become another environmental catastrophe we turn a blind eye to in the name of convenience. Samantha George is a Trinity senior. Her column typically runs on alternate Mondays. "
Kitchen talk: Defying a study abroad stereotype,Anna Garziera,2025-09-28T10:00:00Z,Sep,28,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/kitchen-talk-defying-a-study-abroad-stereotype-20250928.html,"If you only knew one thing about me — that I am in my junior year at Duke — you could take a stab at guessing that I am probably studying abroad this fall semester. Your guess would be correct.I arrived at my homestay in Berlin almost a month ago, and things have been up and running. We started our classes at the Duke in Berlin classroom building (the “KöLu”) almost immediately upon arrival, and have since been visiting Berlin neighborhoods, museums, parks, shops, Biergartens and Spätis. Our Duke in Berlin cohort sticks together like glue.This is typical of most study abroad experiences. You get a group of 15 or so college students who have never met each other, force them to spend time together, and after a week, they’re all more or less best friends. Because of this, what is supposed to be an “immersive experience” is not immersive at all.And honestly, it's almost impossible to prevent. The study abroad group gets along well, so they get comfortable hanging out with each other — only with each other. What results is the same Duke bubble, simply relocated to a different country for a semester. But that’s not supposed to be the point.Study abroad students are supposed to become part of the local community. Most study abroad programs have the goal of teaching students the local language well — much better than they would have learned it on campus, without the “immersive” element.Yet this plan usually falls through. You and I have both heard students talk about their study abroad experiences this way: “I had such a great time, it was just amazing. I didn’t learn that much Italian, but…”This is not always the student’s fault. Sure, there may have been opportunities of “immersion” that the student didn’t take. But especially when first learning a language, going about trying to communicate with locals is really difficult. Not only is there the issue of trying to find the right words, but once they have been more or less found, one also falls in the pickle of trying to pronounce them: “Una broo-she-tah per favor.”Getting understood is a challenge. But suppose one succeeds. More often than not, the native will be fed up with them already and reply — eyeroll — in English: “And what would you like to drink?”So now the student is discomforted and intimidated. You better believe they’re not trying again next time.Granted, Italian waiters can be especially short with foreigners. But the point stands. Most students going abroad are still beginners in the language. And as beginners, it’s hard for them to communicate in the “real world.”That is what study abroad programs are supposed to salvage: By creating an intimate, informal setting for the students to practice speaking the local language, the program offers its students a set of training wheels.For us Duke-in-Berliners, this is embodied in the KöLu, our classroom building. During the first day of orientation, we were asked to sign a sort of “oath” in which we promised to speak as much German with each other as we could — especially when in the KöLu kitchen. Through this initiative they called “Kitchen Talk,” the Duke in Berlin directors hoped to get students to practice the language outside their German classes.And I have to say, to some extent, it’s working. While we are all at different levels of German, we greet each other with “Hallo” and “Wie geht es dir?” in the morning. We describe our actions as we move through the KöLu kitchen: “Ich mache einen Kaffee.We’ve even started to create our own German slang. We’ve shortened “Entschuldigung,” which means “Sorry,” to “Shuldi.”But this is not the only way the “immersiveness” of this experience has surprised me so far.Before we left for Germany, we were asked to write an essay explaining how we hoped our homestay experience would be like. This helped the program directors match us with available homestays. I only had two requests: I wanted to be near nature and I wanted to be spoken to only in German.Duke in Berlin delivered. Not only am I situated right by the Schlachtensee. Since the first day, I have been communicating with my host family only in German. (Granted, they do most of the talking, and I do most of the listening. But I am nevertheless learning a lot this way.)We are taking four classes this semester. Two are German language classes and two are electives. The former are conducted in German. Even when we don’t know how to say something, we are supposed to ask “auf Deutsch.” The latter are taught in English. However, our professors are native Germans. It often happens that we chat with them in German before classes begin.This is all to say, I have been speaking more German than I thought I was going to during this semester. It’s been sneaking in here and there, weaving itself into my daily life.Most importantly, my classmates and I are letting it. And it’s paying off. We are progressing fast through the “Der Die Das” syllabus. Even more, we are starting to feel more and more part of our local community, just as the program had intended.We often spend our afternoons at the lake, just like the locals. We swim across the lake, and like them, launch ourselves off the rope swing into the water. We even met a group of high school boys that we get together with sometimes.With this, I echo something that has been said a hundred times before. To my fellow Duke study abroaders: Make the most of this experience. One semester is not a lot, and it’ll be over before you know it. But try to “immerse” yourself to the extent that your program lets you. You’ll get a lot more out of it that way.Anna Garziera is a Trinity junior. Her pieces typically run on alternate Sundays."
Let's talk about political violence,Meena Puram,2025-09-27T10:00:00Z,Sep,27,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/lets-talk-about-political-violence-20250927.html,"Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, there was an unprecedented outcry from students and politicians on both sides of the political spectrum. President Trump and Vice President Vance flew out to Arizona to make statements at Kirk’s memorial service. A resolution to establish a “National Day of Remembrance” for Kirk passed Congress, with 38 House Democrats voting in favor of the motion. And on the day of the event itself, a plethora of major democratic leaders, including Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, have rushed to X to condemn this as an act of political violence, the former saying that it “has no place in our democracy.”While tragic, the irony of both Kirk’s death itself and the strong wave of bipartisan condemnations is astounding. Suddenly, the very politicians who’ve killed tens of thousands of civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan and are currently funding a genocide in Gaza are condemning acts of political violence, while asking us to direct our empathy towards a man who has upheld politically violent ideologies for his entire career. To name a few, Charlie Kirk has famously asserted that gun deaths are“worth it” to protect Second Amendment rights and it’s worth noting how his notorious “Professor Watchlist” caused multiple academics to be racially profiled and harassed for their own political views. This doesn’t even include the ways our current administration — one whose success Kirk played an instrumental role in facilitating — commits acts of violence against working-class people daily through mass deportations, funding cuts for Medicare and proposals to roll back the EPA air and water quality regulations. So why has political violence become such a pervasive talking point because a singular, prominent far-right activist fell victim to it, but not when ordinary people have been victims of it for decades? And why is it that the very people who are adamant that we must have empathy for Kirk never extend that empathy to the people who have consistently been dealt the short end of the policies Kirk spent years defending? Contrary to what many conservative students and activists claim, the issue isn’t an empathy shortage at all. To whom we extend our empathy is, and always has been, extremely contingent on whose suffering makes the national headlines. As a consequence, no matter how hard we try, our empathy will always be selective. Politicians on both sides of the spectrum carry out political violence daily, albeit through means that are less overtly destructive, less documented and far more impersonal to the average Duke student. After all, the prospect of losing health insurance coverage and SNAP benefits may not seem violent when a majority of our student body doesn’t have to worry about the oppressive, ever-increasing cost of simply staying alive. But even when we do see ordinary human suffering projected on media platforms, one that fits our image of how suffering typically looks, we still tend to distance ourselves from what is happening due to a fear of complicity or inadequacy. In her 2003 book “Regarding the Pain of Others,” Susan Sontag explores the paralyzing and numbing effects of being constantly subject to visual representations of war and tragedy. She writes of how our empathy enables us to not feel like “accomplices to what caused the suffering. [It] proclaims our innocence as well as our impotence.” Over the past two years, we’ve seen videos of entire Gaza cities being leveled, of the elderly dying of starvation while waiting in line for food and of parents sobbing over the dead bodies of their children. Now, when I see a video of a Palestinian family asking for engagement or money, it is far too easy for me to scroll. I say this to illustrate just how pervasive political and moral apathy truly is. It is not that any one of us lacks empathy. It is that this world, with all its horrors, simply demands so much of it.While it’s easy to declare our unbridled empathy for everyone who has ever suffered political violence, regardless of their role in perpetuating said violence, it is extremely hard to carry that idea out. Our empathy will always be influenced by the images and information fed to us by major media outlets, as well as the proximity of that tragedy to our everyday lives. As a consequence, this immensely skewed distribution of our empathy ultimately enables our inaction, while absolving us of responsibility to the people for whom our empathy is the deciding factor between living and dying.Perhaps, then, it’s understandable for Duke students to feel incredibly disturbed by an assassination that happened in broad daylight in the middle of a debate on a college campus just like ours. After all, this event served as a testament to our vulnerability against issues previously contained to television screens and news headlines. But for the others, those who’ve been at the receiving end of violent policies their whole lives, the understanding of how political violence permeates the very fabric of American culture is nothing new. And, well, it’s hard to be troubled by the norm. Meena Puram is a Pratt first-year. Her column typically runs on alternate Tuesdays."
What if she wasn't okay?,Nia Mitchell,2025-09-27T09:00:00Z,Sep,27,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/what-if-she-wasnt-okay-20250927.html,"I should have handled the situation differently. It was during the fourth quarter of the Duke/N.C. State game when I saw “Taylor” lying on the grass in a parking lot. Three people were around her — two young women and a young man. By the time my companion parked his car and I went back to check on the situation, there were only two people with her. Later, I realized the third person went to get their car.As I approached, I asked if their friend was okay. They tried to wave me off, saying that she was fine. I asked if she had been drinking. They acknowledged that she had. When I asked how much, the young man replied, “Quite a bit.” At some point, I explained that I am a doctor and was concerned about their friend. They assured me that she was okay, that they were giving her water. I explained that she might need more than water — that she might need medical care because she may have alcohol poisoning. Later, I wished I had explained what alcohol poisoning was and its life-threatening nature. Alcohol poisoning, which is also known as an alcohol overdose, is a potentially fatal condition caused by drinking large amounts of alcohol over a short period of time. The young lady told me that she was Taylor’s roommate, who would be with her through the night. She implied that this was not the first time this had happened. While she may have thought this would reassure me, I found it even more concerning. I leaned down to the young woman lying on the grass. She was able to tell me her name. “I’m Dr. Mitchell. Are you okay?” She gave me a thumbs-up. Her roommate repeated that she would look after her. A small SUV pulled up. I thought about taking a picture of the license plate, but then I thought that would have been too intrusive. I assume it was driven by the third person I initially saw with the group. The young man thanked me several times, remarking that their ride was here. Because she was conscious, and they declined my help, I was not sure what to do. As they were helping Taylor into the car, I weakly offered, “Please make sure you put on your seat belts.”I walked away feeling both concerned and helpless. I felt as though I should have done more, but I did not know what “more” was. Should I have called 911? Should I have given them my phone number in case things got worse? They were young, perhaps too young to drink legally. Maybe they were worried that they would get into trouble for drinking. Maybe I came across as judgmental. Maybe they see getting drunk at a college football game as a rite of passage that could not possibly be life-threatening. I thought about them as I ate dinner. I thought about them as I heard sirens passing by the restaurant and I prayed that those sirens weren’t for Taylor. I thought about them when I woke up in the middle of the night, hoping that Taylor was okay.I appreciate that they were looking out for her. On January 1, Time Magazine published an article titled “Why Gen Z is Drinking Less.” Six months later, on July 2, Newsweek declared that “Gen Z is Drinking More.” Perhaps Gen Z is drinking less. Perhaps, they’re drinking more. However, neither article helped me know what to do when I encountered Taylor and her friends. This is not just a Gen Z problem. Excessive alcohol consumption is a problem that cuts across generations. Just as in decades past, some young people today drink before they’re legally allowed to, and some continue to drink excessively, even after reaching legal age. In any case, across generations, there’s a persistent belief that getting intoxicated at a football game is a normal part of the college experience.But the consequences are anything but normal. In the United States, alcohol poisoning causes over 2,600 deaths each year. That’s just a fraction of the 61,000 deaths attributed to binge drinking, which is defined as consuming four or more drinks for women, or five or more drinks for men, within two hours. I do not have children, but I do have nieces and nephews — the youngest of whom is in his first year at college. I tried talking to my nephew about the dangers of alcohol. I don’t know if he heard me. I hope that if my nephew is obviously intoxicated, his friends look out for him. I also hope that if someone sees him and his friends, they know what to say or what to do to help them.As a physician, I wondered: Where are the guidelines that tell us what to do when we come across someone who is conscious, but obviously intoxicated and possibly impaired? If you live with someone who is, how often should you check on them to make sure they are okay? What is “okay?”I looked, but I did not find any official guidelines. But the University of Virginia’s Gordie Center created a guide, “Helping an Intoxicated Friend”, named after a University of Colorado student who died from an alcohol overdose. According to the website, if you are concerned about a potential case of alcohol overdose, check on the person every ten minutes and remember the acronym: PUBS!* P: Puking while passed outU: Unresponsive to pinching or shakingB: Breathing is noisy, slow, shallow, or has stoppedS: Skin is blue, cold, or clammy. If the person has darker skin, check for pale lips or nail beds.!: If you see even one PUBS sign of alcohol overdose at any time, call 911 immediately.*: If you're unsure, call the National Poison Center.It has been almost a week, and thankfully, there have been no news stories about a young woman overdosing on alcohol. So, in this instance, Taylor’s friends were correct; she was okay. This time. But what if she wasn’t?Taylor, and Taylor’s friends, if you read this, please let me know that you’re okay. Please let me know if there was anything I could have said or done to help you that day. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help you today.Nia Mitchell is an associate professor of medicine."
A tale of two vigils,Kris Sun,2025-09-26T10:00:00Z,Sep,26,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/a-tale-of-two-vigils-20250926.html,"Some nights ago, I joined other fellow community members in front of the Chapel, banded together in somber silence. We were huddled in a circle, the only illumination coming from the candles that emanated across our faces. As I scanned the crowd, I remembered appreciating the diversity of people present. Folks of all different demographics. Students, eyes salted with tears, were still wearing backpacks because they had just come from their studies. Adults, including faculty, whose somber faces hid their anger. Community members, who felt just as much a part of Duke as everyone else present, and just as impacted by the tragedies that violence has wrung upon us. Each person clasped a little trinket in their hand.Vigils are like tattoos: we partake in them because they help us remember something, or someone, in a fashion that gives their memory a little more permanence. I don’t intend to ever get a tattoo, and I had hoped to never have a reason to go to a vigil. But political violence disagreed.In the past week, I attended not one vigil, but two: one in remembrance of Charlie Kirk and the other in honor of the fourteen individuals who’ve died while in ICE custody and the four individuals killed during ICE raids since November 2024. At one vigil, I was given a flag. At the other, a butterfly. These were the little trinkets clutched in every attendee's hands as they mourned the consequences of political violence.Now, I’d like you to reread the introduction twice, first with the lens that the vigil was in remembrance of Charlie Kirk, then with the lens that the vigil was in remembrance of those who died in ICE custody. If you fight your partisan urges enough, you’ll quickly realize that both vigils were broadly similar. These vigils uniquely reflect the culture and clash between politics and loss here at Duke, but they also potentially represent a vast ecosystem for future unity — for those willing to explore it. Let’s re-examine both vigils.The day of Charlie Kirk’s murder was tragically shocking on multiple fronts, as it was coupled with gun violence at Colorado’s Evergreen High School, the killing of Iryna Zarutska a month before and the anniversary of the September 11 attacks the next day. Even before the news of Kirk’s shooting, the Duke College Republicans and Duke Young Americans for Freedom were already in a moment of reflection, preparing for a 3:00 AM descent down Abele Quad to plant 2,977 US flags.When the news broke, the conservative club GroupMes filled with, not hate messages or intolerance, but requests for prayer and urges that people abstain from watching the video. Confirmation of Charlie Kirk’s death led to further urges for togetherness. “We have to show unity tomorrow on behalf of our country. Bring your friends, tell everyone,” a Duke College Republicans leader messaged. This reaction is a far cry from the hostility that modern media has portrayed of conservative voices, who some believed would act in retaliation due to the shooting. Duke’s conservative groups had the same fear, leading to the presence of the Duke Police Department outside the vigil.The vigil itself included a tight-knit circle on the edge of the chapel entrance; visitors squeezed in tight to block the cold and wind, which were constantly snuffing out the candles. The sky was pitch black. There was a cloud of mourning among all attendees, including myself, as we struggled to keep every candle lit. I stood at the very front, next to the speakers. Across from me were nearly 100 people of all different ages and backgrounds, holding lit candles in one hand and the American flag in the other.My intention with these descriptions is not to paint a rose-tinted image, but to point out the humanity that exists when we ignore partisanship. As a liberal individual, I had my own reservations about attending, particularly about whether I would be safe. Instead, I was taken aback by the inclusion that I felt. I attended, clutching my hand-held flag in contemplation of political violence. Speaking of violence, there is no doubt that the actions taken against victims of the recent immigration policy should also be classified as political violence. This theme was one of the primary assertions at the Beyond Borders vigil. Classifying Charlie Kirk’s death as political violence while arguing that the actions of ICE aren’t politically motivated is hypocritical to the same degree as humanizing the victims of ICE while refusing to humanize Charlie Kirk. Indeed, Charlie Kirk was human, as were the eighteen individuals who died to the hands of ICE:Lorenzo Antonio Batrez Vargas, Ramesh Amechand, Chaofeng Ge, Genry Ruiz Guillen, Tien Xuan Phan, Serawit Gezahegn Dejene, Isidro Pérez, Maksym Chernyak, Johnny Noviello, Brayan Rayo Garzón, Jesus Molina Veya, Nguyen Nhon Ngoc, Abelardo Avelleneda Delgado, Silvero Villegas-Gonzales. Roberto Carolos Montoya Valdés, Haime Alanis, Marie Ange Blaise and one other non-publicized individual. These individuals died while in ICE custody or while being chased by ICE. One individual was struck by oncoming traffic while attempting to flee a Home Depot ICE raid, while another fell 30 feet while trying to escape. At least two others died by suicide, and one was shot by an ICE enforcer.The vigil honored these individuals through speeches, songs and performances. Flags — from China, Honduras, Mexico, Vietnam, Ukraine — hung to the side of a centerfold of candles in the shape of a butterfly. Like the Kirk vigil before, the wind continuously signaled to the crowd that the world was grieving too. Emotions ran high, so much so that attendees saw their frustrations turn to tears. When the vigil ended, most people stayed for long afterwards in embrace with other community members.The event’s primary interest wasn’t to target political ideologies so much as it was to target politically driven actions and cultural intolerance. The loss of these individuals is also communal, in the same way that the removal of Luis Alonso Juárez is a loss to the entirety of the Duke community. In a unique moment of unity, one speaker encouraged the crowd to hold hands and chant, “I am strong. We are strong.” I once more clutched a trinket in my hand, a butterfly-stick, in anger.In writing this article, I originally attempted to depict grandiose differences between the two vigils. Instead, I’m struggling to name more than a select few surface-level differences. Yes, they honored vastly different individuals in vastly different situations. Sure, they occurred at slightly different times in slightly different configurations. But the core of both vigils tackled the consequence of immense loss in familiar, community-driven ways. The attendance at both vigils was roughly the same. The only true, valuable difference was who chose to attend.I attended both vigils. I haven’t yet found or recognized anyone who has done the same. The vigils for Charlie Kirk and those who died to ICE gave spaces for the Duke community to reflect on our own political biases, and how these biases may have given way to political violence. The Duke community, therefore, has a commitment to meet these vigils in the middle and take some time to reflect. Instead, few individuals, if any, took the time to attend both vigils, let alone one of them.Our extreme partisanship often feeds on itself in the style of a positive feedback loop. Extreme thoughts lead to more extreme thoughts. And when left to fester, extreme partisanship then leads to political violence. This cycle is what led to the existence of the two vigils in the first place. But political violence doesn’t have to be a part of this loop. As the vigils show, our response to political violence can be through messages of unity. The Kirk vigil could have easily turned into a political rally of like-minded individuals. Instead, the vigil remained diligent, never once blaming political opposition. The speakers emphasized the importance of placing civil discourse above partisan bickering. Similar notions of unity surrounded the attendees of the Beyond Borders vigil.As the Provosts’ Initiative on the Middle East states in their recent opinion piece, “we need to engage in ways that provide different perspectives in a spirit that aims primarily to inform and educate and refrains from negating the basic humanity of individuals.” Honing onto this mindset makes it all the more possible to reason with those whom you disagree with and to contribute towards communal growth through civil discourse. Perhaps it would also encourage more individuals to see the value of both vigils held in the past week.I attended two vigils. But it honestly felt like I attended the same vigil twice. Two times I mourned for similar causes, with similar communities, suffering a similar pain. I wish neither vigil had to happen in the first place. Nevertheless, I have both the butterfly and the flag in my room, hanging alongside one another. They don't look so bad together.Kris Sun is a Trinity sophomore.

Being in the world,Robert Wallace,2025-09-25T10:00:00Z,Sep,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/being-in-the-world-20250925.html,"As Clarissa Dalloway, Virginia Woolf’s eponymous protagonist, strolls down the streets of 1923 London, she is thinking about flowers. She is also thinking about what it means to be in the world. The pre-war, pre-influenza world no longer exists. The streets are crowded, jostling with an assortment of moving vehicles, the clamor of brass bands and barrel organs, and, surprisingly, the droning of an aeroplane that is making letters in white smoke.What do they say?No one knows for sure. The letters are indecipherable. The bafflement the onlookers feel exemplifies the tone of the novel, revealing a kind of collective post-traumatic stress disorder. Millions have died from influenza and war.It was in this wake of terrible tragedy that Virginia Woolf penned her novel in 1925. In her diary, she wrote: “I want to give life & death, sanity & insanity; I want to criticize the social system & to show it at work, at its most intense — But here I may be posing.” What exactly does she mean by “posing?” It’s hard to say, but I believe she was referring to the boldness of what she was striving for, a new way of looking at what it means to be alive, to be human. A kind of reseeing. The audaciousness of her experiment can be seen when she questions her brazenness later in her diary: “Have I the power of conveying the true reality?”This reality, for Virginia Woolf, post-new world, was an earth-shaking shift in storytelling. The narrative choice to move swiftly in and out of a character’s consciousness was groundbreaking. She claimed she had no affection for reality, for she — and all of Europe — had experienced incomprehensible tragedy. Reality could no longer be adequately explained in the normal literary ways. It called for something innovative. How could one explain the changed rules for Eros and Thanatos except by creating something new? More importantly, how to convey what is inside a character’s mind?The characters in ""Mrs. Dalloway"" aren’t satisfactorily talking with each other. They can’t. Speech becomes silence, as Woolf drifts in and out of their minds, unraveling thoughts about, well, everything: the war, loneliness, lost loves, “flimsy nincompoops,” ducks cavorting in a pond. They ruminate, as we all do. About what it means to be alive in the world, to be a conscious being, a self.Several years ago, I was in a coffee shop in Calgary, Alberta. It was a small shop, a few backless chairs and some tall round tables. The barista’s name was John. He said he was named after John Lennon, though I didn’t catch what his middle name was, or his last. Or the reason for his parents’ attachment. He appeared to know many of the customers by name. I sat listening to the banter between John and the customers. It was friendly and honest, and sympathetic.Music was playing in the background. Quiet music. Drums. A little chanting. John started chatting about Lennon the poet, the philosopher.“Living is easy with eyes closed,” he said to one customer.A guy came in and he mentioned that he filmed a recent TED Talk episode. He didn’t name the subject. He started describing where the episode was filmed and he and John tossed back and forth about the location in Calgary, a non-descript spot on a road that I didn’t catch.“I’ve always wanted to attend a TED Talk,” John said.Another guy came in and he began talking about a party that night. And then he started talking about his dad. He said he got up one morning and went out the backdoor to let the cat out and his dad was in the yard digging holes.“What was he doing?” John asked.“Dirt fishing,” the man said.“Dirt fishing?”“Yeah, that’s what my dad called it. He was out there with a metal detector, hoping to find something.”“Did he?”“No. But here’s the thing. He asks me to go with him to the Yukon for a few days, to dirt fish.”John laughed. “Did you go?”The guy laughed back. “Yeah, I did.”“It’s all about connections,” John said. “A road trip with your dad. To go dirt fishing. I love it.”This was what Virginia Woolf tried to do with ""Mrs. Dalloway"". To show us the connections.Some have argued that Clarissa Dalloway wasn’t fully engaged in the world. She, after all, didn’t know the difference between Armenians and Albanians, and, preferred not to think about it. This is a fair judgment of the character; not Woolf herself. Woolf never claimed that her protagonist spoke to feminists. But she — Woolf — surely did, if for no other reason than her novel, her modernist approach to storytelling expresses an artistry that has, I believe, a feminist vision.She cares about her characters, despite their flaws. She cares enough that she is willing to go in and out of her character’s minds, so that we, as readers, get a glimpse of who they are. In doing so, she is claiming the lives of all of us. She is claiming not only the self, but the self of others. This is not only a gift of reality, but of love.So what would Virginia Woolf say about the world, a hundred years after the publication of ""Mrs. Dalloway""? She would be saddened. Saddened that women are losing self-control of their own bodies, that the world continues to harbor men to lead nations by tyranny. Saddened by the decline in individual rights both here and abroad. But she would have written about it, perhaps found a new way to tell the story of today. From the plunge of time, what Virginia Woolf was about, more than anything, was about the self, and connecting with other selves.Robert Wallace is a first year graduate student of liberal studies.

You got rejected from ‘every’ club. Now what?,Katelyn Cai,2025-09-25T10:00:00Z,Sep,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092425-cai-20250925.html,"I quit my business fraternity three months into my freshman fall. To many in the Class of 2029, this may sound unthinkable and, certainly, unwise. I’d snagged a coveted spot that more than 100 other underclassmen had vied for, a fact the fraternity pledgemasters never ceased to mention. Not to mention, this club was a career accelerator, placing members at Meta, McKinsey and Goldman Sachs, corresponding to the Big Three career tracks of tech, business, and finance. Like any stereotypical Duke student, I was an ambitious and effective ladder climber, and I had seemingly managed to scale my newest challenge: Duke’s competitive extracurricular scene. Here, it’s not just business organizations that are competitive. It’s dance, acapella, community service, research, sports, even cultural organizations. No corner of campus is safe from selectivity.It’s been nearly impossible to have conversations with new Dukies without them mentioning just how hopelessly competitive everything seems. If you feel like you’ve just gotten here but Duke’s doors are already closing, let me reassure you: the doors are still wide open. But the anxiety you feel? It’s not just in your head, and you are not alone. Our club process is both cutthroat and intensely curated. Scale & Coin, Delta Sigma Pi, and Duke Consulting Club all had record-high numbers of applicants, while pledge classes have remained largely the same size. These clubs, among others, want you to know they’re selective; they’re selling you on membership by highlighting their selectivity and convincing you that you have won if you get in (and therefore, lost if you haven’t). It’s not just Duke that’s contributing to your stress: our world is in an uncertain place. The job market is worsening, graduate school admissions are getting harder, and it doesn’t help that the federal government is no longer hiring. Add an unhealthy dose of existential dread — the majority of Americans don’t feel like the country is heading in the right direction — and it’s absolutely understandable to feel that stomach-churning mix of stress and impostor syndrome. When I quit three years ago, I felt like a failure. A well-meaning friend told me he was worried my quitting would negatively “impact” the consulting career I didn’t even know if I wanted. But, as a senior, I have no regrets. That was my first step in freeing myself from the pre-professional prison Duke convinced me I had no way out of. My pledgemasters had wanted me to quit dancing, so I could focus on more “productive” activities. Instead, as a freshman, I co-choreographed a piece for ASA’s Converge showcase. Because I was able to surround myself with people outside of the pre-professional bubble, I found the courage to do what I wanted, rather than doing what I thought I needed to do. I could’ve never imagined the shenanigans I’ve gotten up to: creating my own major studying trust in media and institutions, traveling to 12 different countries (on Duke’s dime!), giving campus tours to Singaporean billionaires and chasing down politicians in the halls of Congress. And, if it brings you comfort, I still did snag that prestigious hedge fund internship.College is more than just one long job search, and you deserve to know that you are more than what you do or achieve. If you’re always climbing ladders, you’ll only know how to find the next rung; stop, instead, to admire the view. Celebrate that you’re already at Duke. While you’re here, join the clubs that make you excited. If there aren’t any, make your own. Existing pre-professional clubs represent just one of many well-trodden paths. They were built to help you succeed, and if you choose to join one, you will meet incredible people and develop the skills to do incredible things. But if you didn’t get in (or make the difficult choice to leave), you get to chart your own path. There’s nothing scarier or more exciting than the unknown.But, it’s not as if nobody’s done it before. I’d even venture to say, there’s a whole lot of Duke students who are not a part of clubs that take just 20 new members a semester. And many more that rushed multiple times before getting in. There are more of us on the outs, than the in. Welcome to our own little exclusive club!Katelyn Cai is a Trinity senior. Her column typically runs on alternate Thursdays."
Is Tallman Trask what Duke stands for?,Adam Levin,2025-09-24T10:00:00Z,Sep,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/is-tallman-trask-what-duke-stands-for-20250924.html,"Generally speaking, hitting someone with your car and allegedly calling them a racial slur is frowned upon — illegal even. Not at Duke. What do I mean? On September 3rd, Duke University President Vincent Price announced that Tallman Trask, Duke’s Executive Vice President from 1995-2020, would receive the 2025 University Medal for Distinguished Meritorious Service. This annual award, given to him and Anne Bass (of Bass Connections), is the university’s highest honor. According to Price, he helped rebuild and modernize the physical infrastructure of Duke — remaking buildings like the iconic Western Union. Trask paid painstaking attention to every detail of the campus, including his involvement in the creation of the famed “Duke Brick”, a brick giving the impression of stone, coming in colors like “Brown Tweed,” “Cimarron” and “Light Autumn.” Under his leadership, Duke’s endowment grew substantially, and he took the ostensibly painful yet necessary austerity measures during the 2008 and 2020 recessions. Somewhat ironically, Trask was also one of Duke’s highest-paid employees — and saw his compensation actually increase (by 61%) to $1.6 million at its peak in 2022, 2 years after he retired.However, to put it generously, Price’s explanation of Trask’s legacy is not shared by everyone. Rather, Price and Duke’s administration’s decision to grant Trask this award exemplifies the problematic way Duke views its employees and the Durham community. It represents Duke’s prioritization of financial gain over another, perhaps more important goal of a liberal arts institution: its service to the world and the community around it. Why is Trask viewed so differently among Duke’s employees and the Durham community compared to Duke’s administration? There are a few major reasons:In 2014, Trask was accused of hitting a Duke parking attendant, Sylvia Underwood, with his car after she stopped him while directing traffic at a football game. After hitting her, the mere thought of Underwood, who is black, leaving a dent in Trask’s pristine Porsche fueled a fiery anger within Trask, causing him to — allegedly — call her a “dumb, dumb stupid [n-word].” Importantly, although he maintains that he didn’t call Underwood a slur, several witnesses corroborated key elements of the incident, including his use of the n-word. Trask’s alleged act became part of the grievances for a week-long sit-in by student protestors at the Allen Building in 2016 and led to a civil lawsuit against him. He eventually released an apology, again denying that he called her a slur, nonetheless admitting, in the famously meaningful and powerful jargon of corporate-speak, that his “conduct fell short of the civility and respectful conduct each member of this community owes to every other.” He also privately sent Underwood a much less verbose apology after she filed a police report, writing, “Dear Ms. Underwood, I very much regret the incident before the Elon football game. I should have been more patient and I apologize.” His two-line note, notably less polished, does not capture any remorse for the incident — and feels very much like an obligatory response to a legal situation.If I listened to Trask, however, I honestly wouldn’t worry about that scandal. Trask doesn’t want to “dwell on that episode.” Instead, in possibly the most tone-deaf, ‘I have black friends’ form of an apology, he explained that when he was in high school, his mother interrupted a study session to hand him Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter From Birmingham Jail,” a work he has “returned to several times over the years.” Yes, he said that. No, that is not satire. But that’s not the only controversy Trask has been embroiled in. He played a key role in shutting down the GoTriangle light rail project, a public transportation project 20 years in the making, with $130 million already spent, that would have connected the Durham and Orange County areas. In 2016, he was involved in planning a massive natural gas plant, which was strongly opposed by environmental activists in Durham and at the Nicholas School, and was scrapped just two years later. These scandals merit their own examination, but what Trask will be remembered for most is his legacy of disrespect to Duke’s employees. Beyond the obvious, Trask instituted a system imposing Duke’s financial hardships on its employees, one that lingers today. These changes included a hiring freeze, except for positions deemed essential; no university-paid retirement contributions for a year and a lack of pay and benefits for part-time dining and facilities workers. In fact, “hundreds” of Duke workers were laid off or had their hours zeroed during the pandemic. The sentiments expressed throughout Trask’s career — of the expendability of Duke’s employees, especially part-time workers in the Facilities Management Department (FMD) — were key drivers of the Allen Building Sit-In in 2016. Anastasia Karklina, Trinity ‘14, explained during the protest, “Our presence here has to be contextualized within the larger struggle of black and brown workers at Duke that has been going on for decades.” If it’s any indication of the larger struggle with administration, instead of leaving Trask to defend himself after the incident with Underwood, Duke’s Vice President of Administration, Kyle Cavanaugh, hand-delivered Trask’s poorly written apology note for him.Now, Duke’s choice to memorialize and celebrate Trask further enshrines those sentiments within Duke’s leadership. It’s telling that the administration has chosen to grant him such a high honor at the same time that they are engaged in widespread voluntary and involuntary layoffs of Duke faculty and staff. Even though Duke has taken relatively smaller cuts than other peer institutions, it is aiming to cut budgets by 10 percent. This is happening largely at the expense of employees, while leaving administrators untouched. Even outside of the federally catalyzed budget cuts, Duke’s mistreatment of its employees is endemic. In April, Lee Brodie, a heavy equipment operator who maintains West Campus, explained in The Chronicle that racial discrimination and general labor violations were normalized, and that FMD workers were operating on 2017 wages with a 2025 cost of living. Additionally, Luis Juárez, a beloved C1 bus driver known for his “party bus,” is at imminent risk of deportation, and Duke has refused to sponsor a work visa for him. So Trask’s award is shocking, yes. But surprising? No. Choosing to immortalize Trask as the exemplar of Duke is yet another symbol of the administration’s priorities: aesthetics and financial gain over the well-being of their employees and community. Amid a national crisis of financial, moral and ethical priorities — and when universities like Harvard are demonstrating their willingness to cough up $200 million of their own money to support their research and staff — it’s time for Duke to decide what it really stands for.

The unfed mind devours itself: Duke has an AI problem,Wendy House,2025-09-24T10:00:00Z,Sep,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/the-unfed-mind-devours-itself-duke-has-an-ai-problem-20250924.html,"In May of this year, our Provost, Alec Gallimore, proudly announced a sweeping initiative to integrate — or infect — every square inch of Duke University with AI. From requiring deans and vice provosts togive proof of incorporation of AI into their work, to making ChatGPT complimentary to all students, to creating and disseminating Duke’s very own DukeGPT, the message from the administration is clear: we are welcome, nay, implored to use AI in our academic endeavors. My thoughts are as follows:What the hell are we doing? Have we forgotten what we’re even here for?Last I checked, a university is an institution of higher learning; of tasting a wide array of intellectual delicacies and picking out favorites; of developing critical thinking skills; of doing the reading, the writing, the processing, all for ourselves. In what kind of backwards world is it the place of a university to endorse having your learning digested for you by a machine?Research states unambiguously that reliance on AI is correlated to reduced critical thinking — and that tracks. When you have unrestricted access to a bot that never fails to provide a confident answer (regardless of actual accuracy), it is easy for that to become a crutch. First, you use it to check your answers; next, you use it to check your thinking; next, wittingly or unwittingly, you let it teach you how to think.This phenomenon is plain to see here on campus. For instance, I recently observed a peer in a lecture allow less than five seconds of reflection to pass before switching tabs to paste a query into an AI bot. This classmate was not alone; it’s only natural to take the shortest and easiest route available to you when faced with a problem. Convenience is seductive. It is the solemn obligation of the University to prevent this age-old habit of minimizing labor from diminishing our learning.That’s not to say generative AI (gen-AI) is the devil (pun intended). Some very competent educators support the idea that AI can be applied successfully in the classroom as an aid in asking enriching questions and increasing the interactivity of lessons. Many of the smartest people I know use ChatGPT to study. But, especially in introductory courses, gen-AI makes it too easy to bypass the basics. It feels wonderful to be able to breeze through your homework without the tedium of swapping through eighteen different tabs or, dare I say, actually checking the textbook, but you don’t memorize anything that way. I’m scared that the Duke administration intends to create a generation of young professionals who won’t be able to do their jobs without an AI assistant.The obvious rebuttal to this concern: if AI is here to stay, what, then, is the point of learning anything it can do for us? My response: if you want your job done for you, you do not love your job. Past that, if we allow our basic analytical skills to wither, it will bleed into all other sectors of our lives. We might find ourselves asking ChatGPT for advice on what car to buy, where to live, how to dress, what groceries to pick up. I can’t imagine anything more dystopian.Duke’s Mission Statement proudly asserts that it aims to produce “adults committed to high ethical standards.” You may also be familiar with Duke’s loud self-identification as a pillar of sustainability and hope for a green future. Both these statements become immaculately ironic in the face of Provost Gallimore’s Initiative. The power needs of North American data centers roughly doubled from 2023 to 2024, driven majorly by gen-AI. The ravenous energy appetites of artificial intelligence models cannot be sated at the rate at which they are increasing and with the infrastructure of the US, without heavily relying on fossil fuel combustion. Because AI has never existed with the sophistication it does now, it comes with a laundry list of unique demands. For one, the process of training models involves rapid energy fluctuations, requiring the use of diesel-based generators to buffer; for another, computing equipment needs exorbitant amounts of chilled water to prevent overheating. In sum, what we understand about the environmental implications of AI is that there are many and deleterious. And how does the Provost’s Initiative account for these implications? A vague two-sentence blurb without any even semi-concrete measures of accountability for the amount of Mother Nature’s blood on Duke’s hands. The faculty chair for the “Sustainability in AI” pillar isn’t even specialized in climate science.All of this could be excused as a difference of opinion if I thought this initiative had been carefully considered and was earnestly believed to be the right choice for increasing the wisdom of Duke students. But that doesn’t seem to be the case. When asked why he put forth the initiative, Provost Gallimore said this: “I think it's important that we embrace AI the way we've done it because AI is here to stay.” He goes on to emphasize the inevitability of AI and, to his credit, suggests the use of Duke’s AI during undergrad as good preparation for effective use of similar tools in a professional setting. I take issue with this reasoning. I believe that when you choose to be an active agent in enabling the use of AI by students and faculty, to the point of providing them with a school-specific model, you should have a better reason than “everyone else is doing it” or “it’s going to happen regardless,” and you should certainly ensure that your model isn’t faulty and prone to disseminating misinformative hallucinations. Is that the kind of university we want to be? Is Duke the school that just sits there and takes it? Someone has to draw a line in the sand. Someone has to be the bad guy in order to protect the sanctity of education. Students will use ChatGPT, sure. But there are ways to force us to learn, to rely on ourselves and not a robot. Call me childish, but I think there is something almost spiritually precious about the process of doing things manually— growing our own wisdom, making our own art. This is the essence of humanity. Self-reflection differentiates Homo sapiens from any other member of the animal kingdom. Brought to my mind are the famous words of Gore Vidal: “the unfed mind devours itself.” As I watch my peers increasingly personify AI bots and rely on them for answers, advice and even emotional support, I fear for the fate of the human mind. I propose an addendum to my quoted phrase: the unfed mind devours itself, and the coddled mind atrophies. Wendy House is a Trinity sophomore. Her column typically runs on alternate Wednesdays."
Gonna lay down my sword and shield,Luke A. Powery,2025-09-23T19:15:00Z,Sep,23,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/gonna-lay-down-my-sword-and-shield-20250923.html,"Violence begets more violence. This is what we’ve seen in just the past two years. Acts of violence against politicians and other public figures — from a political activist at a college campus event in Utah to state legislators at home in Minnesota to a CEO on a street in New York City — have injected fear and brutality into our public consciousness. These high-profile murders are, unfortunately, just the tip of the iceberg. Considering only violence at schools, since the start of 2024, there have been more than 300 incidents of gunfire on school grounds, resulting in more than 90 deaths.But, violence isn’t new; it’s an ancient scourge.In the Bible, there is a story about a man named Malchus. The Gospel of John (18:1-12) tells us that Malchus was a slave in service to the high priest of the temple in Jerusalem. A confrontation ensued between the followers of the high priest and the followers of Jesus. The conflict escalated until, “Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was Malchus.”I have an admission to make: I grew up in the church, I’ve been to seminary, I’m a professor in theological education. Yet, I never really paid any attention to this dude. Malchus is mentioned only one time in the Bible, and his name never stood out to me; it’s as though his life didn’t matter to me. But now, I want to put his name in neon lights, engrave it in my brain, place it on a Post-It note on my heart. I want to print it on t-shirts, have it as a screensaver, and text it to friends and family. Please, oh please, remember the name “Malchus.”Malchus represents the many victims of violence today who are not major public figures. He’s already of a lower social status, a slave, and yet he’s the one on whom violence is enacted, which happens so often to those who are vulnerable in society. He is an innocent victim, like people caught in the crossfire at parks or killed just sitting in their classroom to learn. Malchus’s life mattered like every other human being. No one deserves to have an ear cut off, or to be shot and even killed, for their race, religion, politics, sexuality, gender, and so on.To kill is an attempt to be God because, I believe, God is the author of life who makes each of us in his image. A killer attempts to take the role of God by seeming to decide which of the human lives made by God are worthy of continuing. This is even worse when a killer murders in God’s name because it involves falsely claiming twice the authority of God—in the murder itself and in the declaration that it was God’s will. In the case of Malchus, it is the disciple Peter, a follower of Jesus, who enacts the violence, so it is an attack that is wrong both in the action itself and in the implication that it is the will of God.The story of Malchus doesn’t end with his ear being cut off. What happens next is important. Jesus intervenes, saying to Peter—who is on Jesus’s side in the conflict—""Put your sword back into its sheath.” In other words, put your weapons away! Stop warring against each other. Choose the nonviolent path.I encourage you to remember the victims of violence, like Malchus, and honor their dignity by nurturing and encouraging nonviolence. There can be many creative ways to do this, and I want to highlight just one here. Every year, the Religious Coalition for a Nonviolent Durham leads a vigil, during which every murder victim in Durham from the past year is named, grieved, and acknowledged as beloved. I have been deeply moved when I have participated in these vigils, and this year Duke Chapel Assistant Dean Rev. Bruce Puckett will be taking students to the vigil on Saturday, October 11.Seek peace, and as the spiritual “Down by the Riverside” says, “study war no more” and “lay down [your] sword and shield.”The Rev.

Duke students lack empathy,Sherman Criner,2025-09-19T10:00:00Z,Sep,19,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-students-lack-empathy-20250919.html,"In the wake of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, Duke students are asking truly unsettling questions: When should another person’s death matter to us? Must we share their politics, culture or identity to mourn them? Can we grieve the loss of someone who opposed us — or even rejected the very fabric of our reality? Some students have gone further still, anonymously posting online that “Charlie has no emotional weight on my soul,” and that his 3-year-old daughter is “better off without him.”As a conservative student with many conservative friends (probably to my freshman self’s surprise), I’ve been left wondering what all of this means. Should the deaths of our political opponents have “no emotional weight on [our] soul?” If, God forbid, one of my friends or I were to be attacked, how would our peers, at one of the country’s most prestigious universities, respond? Would they, as has become routine in recent days, condemn the victim’s character before offering their condolences? Would hundreds of students mock the fallen for their barbaric views and even outright sympathize with their killer?I wish I could dismiss these questions. I wish I could say, without reservation, “Of course not.” But recent events make that confidence impossible. Many conservatives now live with the gnawing fear that their deaths would not be met with grief, but with derision.And before you rush to downplay or mock these worries on Sidechat or Fizz, pause for a moment. Would you respond the same way to any other group on this campus? Would you dismiss the concerns of LGBTQ+ students, Black students or Muslim students who felt alienated just days after one of their most prominent leaders was murdered? Or are conservatives uniquely consigned to the sidelines of empathy simply for disagreeing about what it means to lead a good life? And is it only conservatives? Would you care if someone who agreed with you on almost everything except two issues were murdered, or is that two too many? Or maybe it’s simpler than that: you only care about people who are exactly like you.All of that is to say that something deeply troublesome is afoot. When students can no longer trust that their peers would care if they were violently killed, the problem has slipped far beyond polite disagreement; we are confronting a kind of moral decay that the University cannot fix, no matter how many times it slaps the words “Free Inquiry and Belonging” on a faculty panel.I must admit, this conclusion is truly dreadful. But there is a way forward, one that reckons with the fact that our politics are informed by our daily interactions.We tend to see tragedies like the Charlie Kirk assassination as purely political, but in reality, they stem from something more fundamental: the collapse of ordinary, day-by-day empathy. The mindset that makes these attacks thinkable does not arise because someone suddenly decides to murder; it forms through countless small choices to put oneself above others — refusing to hold the door here, dismissing a classmate’s views there. As these habits of indifference accumulate, we loosen our grasp on the messiness of reality and begin to see others as nothing more than the ideas or actions we associate with them. And when that distortion settles in, violence no longer appears unthinkable because to you, you’re not killing a person. You’re killing an idea.To be clear, I am not claiming that every act of political violence is simply the result of daily selfishness. But the same illiberal mindset that leads someone to etch “Hey fascist! Catch!” on a bullet instead of walking a few hundred yards to debate face-to-face is spurred on by these daily omissions. Each misstep erodes our capacity to see that we have duties to one another, even if that person disagrees with us politically.So, throw your trash away. Don’t just stop with your trash; take ownership of this campus and your place within it. Pick up the garbage left by your peers. When you leave the WU bathroom, the Bryan Center, and especially your hall bathrooms, throw your paper towels and other waste in the trash. Why? Because someone else has to pick it up if you don’t. When you order food or coffee, take your AirPods out. Look the worker in the eye and say something polite. Treat the person serving you as a subject with dignity, not an object designed only to meet your needs. Even if they are rude, give you the wrong order, or ignore you entirely, none of that lessens your obligation to respond with love and decency. And when the Blue Zone gate inevitably malfunctions and fails to read your parking pass, as it so often does, speak gently to the Duke parking employee on the other end of the line. Without belaboring it, the point is simple: we must recover the habit of seeing one another as human beings first.Underpinning this basic idea is a lesson more fundamental still: we must learn to see the unlikely beauty of another’s existence. Every Duke student carries a universe of hopes, fears and loves. A Zionist hurrying to class has the same inherent dignity as a Pro-Palestinian activist demonstrating on BC Plaza. A student tabling for Duke College Republicans possesses the same moral weight as a Duke Democrat attending a rally. And, yes, the person who murdered Charlie Kirk possesses the very same intrinsic value as the man whose life he took. It is precisely in the face of such tragedy that we must remember the humanity of all involved, even as we steadfastly pursue justice.In other words, our identities cannot define us more fully than our shared humanity already does.Lest one mistake this for an endorsement of platitudinous relativism, it is not. This is a call not merely to place oneself in another’s shoes, but to humble ourselves before doing so, to notice the plank in our own eye before scrutinizing the speck in theirs. In doing this, you can still disagree with someone, even reject the very fabric of their reality, but you will not reject them. They can always be wrong, but they can never be less than you.The tragedy is not disagreement. Disagreement can be noble, even necessary. The tragedy is that we have forgotten how to hold another’s humanity as sacred while still holding our convictions as true. We have convinced ourselves that caring for someone requires agreeing with them — that empathy demands ideological alignment. But history shows otherwise. One only has to look to moments like Robert Kennedy’s 1968 speech following the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to see how simple and pure the recognition of humanity can be.This does not mean abandoning our beliefs, though we might need to if our worldview cannot accommodate empathy at the human level. It means holding our deepest convictions alongside the awareness that the person before us, no matter how wrong we think they are, carries the same terrible and wonderful weight of being human that we ourselves do. They, too, will die. They, too, suffer. They, too, long to be fulfilled.Perhaps this is what we have lost most of all, not just civility, but wonder. Wonder at the sheer improbability of consciousness, at the fragile miracle of minds that can reach toward other minds and empathize. To waste that gift on cruelty or contempt is to bankrupt not only our campus, but our very souls.I will not lie and say that the path is easy, though it sure is simple. It begins with the radical act of unmasking that boogeyman and seeing the person in front of you as more than a collection of opinions or identity. As someone far more eloquent than I once said, “Let us dedicate ourselves to that, and say a prayer for our country and for our people.”Sherman Criner is a Trinity senior."
The arts are vastly underrepresented at Duke. Can Deborah Rutter change that?,Leo Goldberg,2025-09-18T10:30:00Z,Sep,18,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/the-arts-are-vastly-underrepresented-at-duke-can-deborah-rutter-change-that-20250918.html,"Over the summer, Duke managed to snag one of the biggest names in the performing arts industry to serve as the new Vice Provost for the Arts. Deborah Rutter, the former president of the John F. Kennedy Center, began her term Sept. 1, officially overseeing all arts initiatives at Duke.Rutter’s addition to Duke is big news. Her track record of success in managing the arts nationwide has been remarkable. Heading the Kennedy Center for the last 11 years, she substantially grew the institution both physically and through programming. The first woman to lead the center, she delegated the $250 million REACH initiative for the center’s physical expansion, integrated nontraditional and underrepresented forms of music such as hip-hop into mainstream performing arts and supervised the “Arts and Ideals” exhibit on the life and legacy of John F. Kennedy. Before the Kennedy Center, Rutter held major roles in several prominent professional orchestras, including the Seattle Symphony Orchestra and the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. Most notably, she headed the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO) Association, representing one of the finest symphony orchestras in the world. At the CSO, she was instrumental in reversing a financial downturn and played a key role in attracting major classical music figures, including world-renowned conductor Riccardo Muti and international superstar cellist Yo-Yo Ma. In other words, Rutter is the real deal, and Duke’s ability to attract such an outsized figure to head its arts initiatives on campus is highly impressive. But it is also peculiar. Acquiring someone of Rutter’s caliber would be a reach even for a university with a prestigious arts program, and Duke is anything but. Relative to other peer institutions, the arts at Duke are comparatively lackluster. From my personal experience with music, Duke’s programs are far less robust than those of our fellow universities. Yale, for example, has an entire separate school of music which, amazingly, is tuition-free for all students. Likewise, the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins is one of the world’s finest music conservatories. Harvard, too, offers a world-class dual music program with the Berklee College of Music and the New England Conservatory. Columbia does the same with Juilliard. Each of these schools has multiple orchestral ensembles for classical music alone, subdivided by skill level. Even UNC boasts a rigorous and highly active department of music with a wide variety of interdepartmental pursuits and opportunities.Duke pales in comparison, devoting far less attention to its music programs. It has a relatively small department that does not offer a master's degree, and has no specific performance major, simply an optional performance concentration.I spoke with a member of the Duke music department faculty about this, who found it to be “astounding that Duke can do the things it can with music,” considering the University’s underwhelming support. Duke, according to him, has always been against the notion of having a music school and does not actively seek to recruit musicians due to the centralized process of admissions. At Duke, per his comments, we have an entirely different model and different expectations for the performing arts compared to other schools. Fundamentally, the course design of many music classes at Duke discourages students from investing their time in the performing arts. Enrolling in a class for wind symphony or jazz ensemble only counts for .5 credits a semester, even though they rehearse 4 hours a week, almost twice as long as a standard class. Even worse, most of these classes don’t even count for the elusive Arts, Literature, and Performance (ALP) credit, which is pretty outrageous considering the fact that they are, you know, performing arts. Outside of curricula, the Duke Symphony Orchestra (DSO), has the same level of funding now as it did 30 years ago, despite the group tripling its membership from 30 students to 80-100, according to my interviewee. Baldwin Auditorium, the performance hall for DSO and many other music ensembles on campus, such as the Wind Symphony, lacks basic necessities like dressing rooms. As told to me in the interview, when previously requesting funding for such initiatives to the administration, the department has been told there are simply not sufficient funds.Most frustrating about this institutional indifference to the arts, though, is the way this undermines the immense artistic talent possessed by the Duke student body. From my experience, Duke has just as many deeply gifted artists and musicians as any other peer institution. The DSO regularly performs some of the most advanced and challenging orchestral repertoire ever written, including full-length symphonies, and extremely well, I may add (though as a member of the DSO myself, I may admittedly be biased). Duke does an incredible disservice to these students by providing underwhelming support for their endeavors. The aptitude is there in abundance, but the resources are not. The dedication of peer institutions to cultivating the arts as an integral part of their campuses is lost at Duke, and the exertions of the students involved consequently go unappreciated. Thus, returning to Rutter, it begs the question: what is someone of Rutter’s caliber and renown doing heading an arts department like Duke’s, which, frankly, lacks the prestige she commands? Is Rutter’s appointment Duke’s way of finally trying to invest in the arts the way it deserves? Maybe. I certainly hope so. But it could also signify something else.Thus, I return to the Duke music faculty instructor I interviewed, who provided a clue into this question. He remarked that, historically, when it comes to arts initiatives, Duke has a certain propensity for flashy, showy gestures. Superficially, these appear to be significant investments, but in reality, they lack long-term goals and fail to realize permanent support. In 2005, Duke spent $24 million to build the Nasher Museum of Art, a bold gesture to invest in the arts. But once the museum had actually been built, there was no effort to ensure a sustainable collection was housed there. Princeton, Harvard and Yale, remarked my interviewee, have deeply impressive art collections far superior to anything at Duke. In other words, we have this great, $24 million art museum and nothing to put in it. Likewise, the Rubenstein Arts Center, a $50 million project added to Duke in 2018, is a well-furnished, impressive building with copious amounts of space. Unfortunately, though, despite its potential, the space is underutilized, according to my interviewee. From my own experience as a student, too, the events hosted at the Ruby often have trouble reaching the overall student body. When it comes to the arts, Duke’s tendency is to throw money into handsome projects in the short term, with no intention to sustain them in the long term. Hiring Rutter, therefore, could simply be an outcome of this same proclivity. They got the big name with a presumably handsome contract to generate publicity. Now, it remains up to Rutter if she wants to be yet another symbolic gesture. With this in mind, I concluded the interview with my music faculty interviewee by asking what he would like to see change at Duke from a Deborah Rutter-led arts initiative. His answer was simple: take an interest in the students themselves. Don’t just fund gaudy projects and then leave them idle. Fill the museum with great works. Put on top-notch theater productions. Attract world-class soloists. Support and give higher visibility to the music department and all arts departments. This, he said, he would applaud if done for the benefit of the students. It remains to be seen if Rutter’s arrival at Duke will fulfill this. There is certainly a lot of work to be done. The early signs, unfortunately, don’t look promising. Duke’s team for Rutter has so far kept her extremely insulated. There has been very little communication between her and the faculty in the music and arts departments, according to my interviewee. On reaching out to Rutter’s team for comment, her team initially promised an interview but subsequently reneged and declined to meet. According to them, Rutter, as of now, lacks any long-term goals worth discussing. Despite this, though, I sincerely hope that, under Rutter, the arts at Duke can be fundamentally improved for the good of the students, both who perform them and who enjoy them.

Beyond numbers and community lines,Linda Garziera,2025-09-18T10:00:00Z,Sep,18,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/beyond-numbers-and-community-lines-20250918.html,"It was a gray day in Panama City, one of those mornings weighed down by the clouds. The banana trees hung heavy and the grass was slick with rain. My Duke Engage group — a team of eight Duke students headed by Javier Wallace — was waiting for our community partner inside a small gazebo overlooking the soccer fields. All summer, we would be working with Asociación Deportiva Curundú (ADC), as a part of Duke Engage, a program launched in 2007 that connects students with local nonprofit organizations for a meaningful summer. ADC is a grassroots organization that uses sport, education and nutrition as means to mitigate the issues present in the Panama-Curundú community. We planned to restructure and solidify its soccer program to reach new members, increase its visibility, and collect funds to expand its operations. Contrary to certain Duke Engage programs in the past, one thing was clear from the get-go: we were there to support the organization, not to save it. This was critical, as some programs in the past have inadvertently approached their involvement from a Duke-centered perspective. From the very first day, our understanding of Panama was planned with intention — our program director, Javier Wallace, introduced us to the rich history and culture of Panama City through museum tours, guest lectures and meaningful engagement. By talking to shopkeepers and restaurant owners, eating spicy, unfamiliar food, and learning from Panamanians, we began to understand the fabric of the nation. Alongside office work, every Tuesday and Thursday, we would gather on the fields of Ciudad Del Saber to play soccer with the kids of Curundú in an effort to get to know the members of the community informally and get a sense of our co-workers beyond words and images.One such day, the rain led to our usual soccer practice being held inside a gazebo. Our optimism was clouded by the pragmatic reality: 30 kids were coming, squeezing into a room that was 20 feet wide and 30 feet long. In Panama, the rainy season lasts from May to December, and so it seemed like a mystery how coaches were able to train effectively without proper indoor training spaces.But in fact, Curundú’s experience here only showcases the ingenuity of its community efforts. The neighborhood has been and continues to be a vibrant Afro-Panamanian community in one of the most racially and economically complex countries of the world. It originated as a median between the United States Canal Zone and Panama City — informally planned and with a majority Black or Indigenous population, its culture is unique to its borders. Despite this, Curundú has always experienced tensions with the rest of Panama City. It can’t shake off the stigma of poverty, racial stereotypes and perceived crime that make it difficult to forge genuine relationships with other communities in Panama. Without this external support, it has been forced to get by on its own. This experience is echoed by the people of Curundú, as told to us by the ADC’s founders, Andrés Madrid and César Santos. Madrid was nineteen years old when he founded the organization. Without money or connections, all he could rely on was his determination and his best friend. Yet, despite the odds, ADC began operating in June 2014.At their first try-outs, Madrid told me, they had one ball for seventy kids. They were, at that time, themselves teenagers, scrapping together equipment while working and continuing their own education. Through soccer, they challenge not only the stereotypes of those who live in Curundú, but also help build the community from the inside out. In their journey to do so, we assisted them in whatever way we could, and whatever way they wanted us to. There were obvious needs: soccer cleats, shin guards, a water cooler, a practice space they could use despite the weather. But, there were also other, more logistical challenges too. The organization needed a bank account to receive donations and the website needed an update in order to push fundraising campaigns. I’m sure this process seems standard. Expected, even. By assessing what ADC “lacked,” we were using what in education pedagogy is known as the deficit model, instead of the asset model. The former is consistent with what we were used to doing in our classes. To study for a midterm, you — hopefully — work on what you don’t know first. The latter focuses on scaffolding experiential knowledge rather than “filling the gaps.” At Duke, we are trained to analyze patterns through data and research. Recently, I stumbled across The Chronicle’s annual survey of the class of 2028, a study that describes the 2028 class in numbers and percentages. In many ways these calculations define our time here — they matter. What percent of the curve did you beat? How likely is it that I’ll find a spot at Perkins during finals? (Unlikely). They extend into our social lives too. We were using the deficit model to solve problems. Yet, inadvertently, we were reinforcing the skewed narratives about grassroots and marginalized communities: that they don’t have resources to leverage. The deficit model flattens Curundú into a single narrative. The complexity of the neighborhood gets hidden under statistics. During practice days, I was often amazed by Andrés and César’s leadership. When it rained, they devised impromptu tic-tac-toe soccer games, capture the flag and foot coordination drills that could be done in small spaces. Each Wednesday — when we would eat in Curundú with the founders’ families — we couldn't help but notice the number of people who came up to the table. Kids thanked the coaches for practice, alums stopped for a quick word, parents chatted about the summer training schedule and friends and acquaintances greeted us. We needed to recognize ADC — and organisations like it — beyond their “needs.” Their strengths — leadership, community, talent, determination and resourcefulness — are obvious, and their efforts to break through expectations using their strengths—not measurable tools, but intangible skills, even if they seem “untraditional” are admirable.This was a key element of ADC’s story too. Their success, like much of their current structure, wasn’t traditional. This is what makes ADC, and Curundú special. Before this past summer, ADC didn’t have a formal database for membership or alumni. It wasn’t as though they didn’t have working systems in place, we were just not used to them. For example, the communications between the coaches and students was via word-of-mouth. Once we shifted our mindset, once we all stopped overlooking ADC’s assets, using them instead to fuel our work, we were able to move past previous challenges with ease. The “lack” of formal communication tools seemed less problematic when we acknowledged the breadth of informal communication channels and tight knit community of Curundú; with strong leadership among ADC alumni. Finding additional coaches now became easy. When we eventually reached the end of our time in Panama, we wanted to thank the families of our community partners for welcoming us to their home. We had to make a decision. Going out for a meal forced us to consider childcare, budgeting, tastes and transportation. Bringing a cake to the community erased most of these issues. Ultimately, the right path was obvious. We’d learned to appreciate the characteristics and needs of the community, thinking about it as the residents did, not as Duke students. These community dinners had grown to be our favorite — there was no need to leave Curundú. What I learned through my DukeEngage experience is that organizations like ADC don’t ask for sympathy. They ask for recognition. Non-profit work asks us to challenge the narratives we’ve absorbed — about neighborhoods, their strengths and what young people from places like Curundú can achieve. I came to Curundú thinking I knew how to help. Instead, I found myself learning — from real communities and from leaders — about what it means to challenge traditional narratives and work outside of my comfort zone. I thought I would return with an increased set of skills, some “completed” projects to brandish. But not all growth can be tracked by charts and numbers, sometimes it happens at a dinner table, sharing stories and perspectives, eating a slice of Panamanian cake underneath the setting sun.

In defense of constructive dialogue on campus,"Bruce Jentleson, Abbas Benmamoun, Noah Pickus",2025-09-17T21:00:00Z,Sep,17,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/in-defense-of-constructive-dialogue-on-campus-20250917.html,"In launching the Provost’s Initiative on the Middle East (PIME) in January 2024, Provost Alec Gallimore stated the core goal as to “foster constructive and civil dialogues about these complex, contentious and emotionally charged issues in ways that enhance understanding and build skills that lead to shared learning.” In our view as the faculty leaders of PIME, the statements by comedian Jerry Seinfeld at the September 9 event featuring former Israeli hostage Omer Shem Tov were contrary to that goal. The “505 Days: A Journey of Resilience, Faith and Hope” event was organized and sponsored by Chabad at Duke Undergrads with co-sponsorship from PIME, Duke Program in American Grand Strategy, Jewish Life at Duke, Center for Jewish Studies, Students Supporting Israel, StandWithUS and Duke-Israel Public Affairs Committee. Mr. Shem Tov was among the 251 people taken hostage by Hamas on October 7, 2023. His story is of how hope and faith guided him through his days in captivity. We have heard from a number of the students in attendance in Page Auditorium how moving and impactful Omer’s story has been for them, especially coming from someone of college age who had been at a music festival with friends when he was taken hostage.The invitation to Mr. Seinfeld was issued by Chabad based on the close relationship he had developed with Mr. Shem Tov and his family. Mr. Seinfeld asked that his appearance not be publicized in advance so as not to distract from the program. At the event in introducing Mr. Shem Tov, Mr. Seinfeld implied that those who are members of the Free Palestine movement are antisemitic: “Free Palestine is, to me, just — you’re free to say you don’t like Jews. Just say you don’t like Jews,” Seinfeld was quoted as saying. While there are people, perhaps a minority, who identify with the Free Palestine movement who are antisemitic and oppose Israel’s existence, there are those who are not and do not. Blanket statements, such as this one attributing a singular point of view to a diverse group, are rarely, if ever, accurate and certainly do not contribute to fostering dialogue and mutual understanding. The same is true for statements attributing Islamophobia and non-recognition of Palestinians’ right to a state to all Israel supporters. Mr. Seinfeld then compared the Free Palestine movement to the Ku Klux Klan, asserting that even the KKK comes out in a more favorable light, “a little better because they can come right out and say, ‘We don’t like Blacks, we don’t like Jews. OK, that’s honest.’” Those who hid under robes and behind masks were “honest”? Moreover, many did much more than just say they didn’t like Blacks or Jews. Here, too, Mr. Seinfeld went beyond the bounds of constructive dialogue, especially at a university in the American South. Constructive dialogue does not mean leaving one’s deepest views off the table. But we need to engage in ways that provide different perspectives in a spirit that aims primarily to inform and educate and refrains from negating the basic humanity of individuals. Working with many colleagues and units representing a diversity of perspectives from across the university, this is what we have strived to do through PIME. We’re currently hosting a six-week residency on our Duke campus for five Israeli Jewish, Palestinian and Druze artists from the Givat Haviva Center for a Shared Society who’ve had the personal courage to work together despite counter pressures from within each’s community. This week, in partnership with the Israeli NGO Arava Institute for Environmental Studies and the Palestinian NGO Damour for Community Development, we are hosting a conference, “From Destruction to Sustainable Regional Recovery,” at Duke in DC to assist their joint efforts on Gaza recovery and development. We have partnered with Bass Connections to fund student interdisciplinary research on geopolitical conflict and humanitarian crises in the Middle East and beyond. And we continue to support educational programs on antisemitism and Islamophobia and the efforts by Duke leaders of Jewish Life and Muslim Life to support their communities and build bridges. As we continue our efforts, we recognize that people on different sides of this issue may find shortcomings in our work and our words. In the spirit of the Provost’s Initiative, we invite everyone at Duke to engage constructively with us and others who see things differently from them. We are a university, and debate, healthy skepticism, and open-mindedness remain essential to our educational and research missions. Bruce W.

Duke Dining takes a massive risk with the humble spud,Alex Berkman,2025-09-16T10:00:00Z,Sep,16,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-dining-takes-a-massive-risk-with-the-humble-spud-20250916.html,"Let it be known: the most integral part of Duke isn’t our five-story library or our Gothic Chapel. It isn’t It’s Thyme — despite its noble commitment to food inclusivity (over actual taste) — and it is certainly not the Office of the Ombuds, who, after hours of clicking through their many web pages, I still cannot figure out what “helpful service” they actually provide.It is WU. West Union. The Broadhead Center. The shiny glass box jutting against the Gothic bricks like a glorious sore thumb.There, students may dine on restaurant-quality Indian, Latin, Italian, Japanese and more. But, spoiled as we are, once the appeal of fresh sushi from Gyotaku or ribeye steaks from JBs begins to fade, variation arrives via The Chef’s Kitchen, with its monthly rotating menus.Perched on WU’s top floor, The Chef’s Kitchen has taken us everywhere from Hawaii to Portugal, from the Bayeux to the Bay Area. But the September 2025 iteration may be its boldest yet: The Spud.A dietary staple of European wartime — and, apparently, of new school years in Durham, NC. Each past iteration of The Chef’s Kitchen has tied itself to a place, which raises the question: who, exactly, owns the spud?Is it New Zealand, that first coined the term? Perhaps it is Ireland, whose very history is written in tubers. My dear friend, Thomas Dean of Idaho, once claimed to have eaten 93 potatoes in a single sitting, so perhaps the Gem state should hold the title. We could quarrel over this endlessly, but I won’t hold you much longer. Frankly, I doubt more than a handful of readers even clicked on an article about potatoes.So let’s get into it. The menu features six items: the Classic Loaded Spud, the Buffalo Chicken Spud, the Southwest Spud, the Shrimp Alfredo Spud, the Philly Spud and the Jackfruit Spud. But if your craving for spuds is not yet satisfied, you can also go for sweet potato fries or potato wedges on the side … I know. I sampled the Classic and the Buffalo Chicken. Here are my thoughts:Beginning with the Classic Spud — the potato itself was gargantuan, a starchy stage for its more flashy toppings: bacon, beer cheese, sour cream and green onion.Unfortunately, the toppings had stage fright, or perhaps they never had the talent to begin with. Sure, the bacon was crispy, the beer cheese, yes, preferable to movie theatre nacho cheese, and the sour cream … tasted like sour cream. But ultimately, each bite was monotonous, and it was a trudge to even get through the first half of the spud. Quite frankly, it is a dish that tastes exactly how it looks, but perhaps that is what I should have expected. Am I the fool for thinking otherwise — that maybe there was more to the spud than what meets the eye? But as I sat there, belly full and heart empty, a warm and tender football-sized object cradled into my arms. I thought it to be a baby at first. Then, I noticed it was smothered in buffalo sauce, ranch and beer cheese, and loaded with grilled chicken, jalapeños and pickled onions. What sick man drenches babies in buffalo sauce? I dug into the spud, and sure enough, this one worked. Big time. The buffalo and jalapeños provided a tremendous punch. The pickled onions were juicy and juxtaposed seamlessly with the ranch and beer cheese. The chicken provided some much needed protein that the former spud lacked, and I was comforted in knowing that because it was “grilled,” this football of cheese and carbs was as healthy as a SweetGreen bowl. Altogether, I enjoyed my meal of spuds at the Chef’s Kitchen. Will I be back next week? Likely not. Do I think the choice of spuds as the kitchen’s headliner is bizarre? Absolutely.But maybe there was more to the decision than a simple craving for baked potatoes.In Judaism, during Passover, we dip bitter herbs in saltwater to symbolize the tears of our ancestors who once suffered as slaves. We do not eat the herbs for pleasure, but rather as a reminder to remain grounded.Perhaps this was the very message The Chef’s Kitchen intended to send. That is, once a month, Duke students may forgo Ginger and Soy or Tandoor and instead hunker down with a massive, monotonous spud — a ritual reminder that (i) for most of history, the average man or woman would have gone through hell and back for a Classic Spud, and (ii) we are all incredibly fortunate to have WU in our lives.So, the next time you walk through those tall glassy doors, grumbling about eating sushi for the third day in a row, do yourself a favor:Go have a spud. I promise, your next poke bowl will be the most refreshing one yet.So, to that, I say three things:Cheers to Wu. Cheers to You. Cheers to Spuds.Alex Berkman is a Trinity senior.

"A radical imagination comes from the people, not the University",Bindu Thota,2025-09-14T09:00:00Z,Sep,14,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/a-radical-imagination-comes-from-the-people-not-the-university-20250914.html,"In many religious traditions, prophets have one central task: to speak the truth they receive from God to the people, no matter how uncomfortable it is for their community to hear. Because of this, prophets have often been silenced — sometimes with death. From ancient prophets like Elijah, to modern-day ones like Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and Óscar Romero, the road to justice often leads to execution.In the book of 1 Kings, the prophet Elijah, convinced he is forgotten and overwhelmed with despair, cries out to God: “I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away (1 King 19:14).” Elijah’s prophetic task was threefold — confront Israel’s idolatry, challenge corrupt rulers and unmask the worship of those rulers itself. In that moment of agony, he believed he had failed his mission. But God replies, “Yet I will leave 7000 in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him (1 Kings 19:18).” You are not alone, God says. There is a remnant.That sense of searching for the remnant came with me when I arrived at Duke Divinity School in September 2024. I carried with me a question: What does a divinity school — dedicated to the worship of a Palestinian Jewish man named Jesus Christ — have to say about our current moment? The answer was deafening silence. So I started looking for the 7000.The first remnant was behind a picnic table next to the Biology building. Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) had posted about a new group — the Jewish Solidarity Movement (JSM). I signed up and soon received coordinates for their next meeting. Coordinates. I had never thought much about latitude and longitude until that moment.At the meeting, we shared why we had come. The Jewish students there wanted no part in a community using the Jewish faith to justify a nation-state committing acts that leading scholars have identified as genocide. When they asked why I was there, I said, “I believe in a Palestinian Jewish man named Jesus. I understand his Palestinian side. I came to understand his Jewish side.”Through the Jewish Solidarity Movement, I began to imagine what collective liberation could look like, even in this moment. In Christian theology, there is a Greek word for fellowship: Koinonia — a community of mutuality where giving and receiving are shared and everyone’s dignity is upheld. I envision Koinonia as the kind of community where, when one person says, “I’m at 20% today,” the others say, “We will be your 80%.”One moment stands out as Koinonia being actualized at Duke. In January 2025, the SJP and JSM learned that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would be recruiting at Duke’s career fair, and migrant justice groups on campus did not feel safe tabling. So members of JSM and SJP took shifts offering “Know Your Rights” handouts in multiple languages. I tabled beside Nathan, a Jewish freshman. “Economics 205 just let out,” he alerted. “Get ready.” I laughed. I was ten years out of undergrad, but in that moment, Nathan and I were bound by a prophetic mission. Our migrant community was at 20%, and we came in at 80%.That was Koinonia, a different kind of moral imagination. The day was not extraordinary for its drama, but for its clarity — our solidarity came from the truth that none of us is free, until all of us are free. We were not always brave. Some of us hesitated, unsure if speaking out was worth the risk. A few faculty offered quiet encouragement where they could; most said nothing at all. Still, we kept showing up. We rotated shifts, shared our experiences, and reminded one another that if we were few, we were not alone. Koinonia is built on commitment — the kind that holds fast even when only a remnant remains.Yet even as we held one another up, we knew our struggle was bound to a wider story. What was happening at Duke echoed what was happening across the country. The ongoing genocide in Gaza, the reelection of Donald Trump and the rise of a new McCarthyism have all made clear what many of us already feared: history was repeating itself. State violence abroad was paired with political scapegoating at home. We have seen this playbook before — in the Red Scares after the World Wars, when dissenters were labeled traitors and driven from their jobs. Today, faculty who speak for Palestine face dismissal or blacklisting. We saw it in the Palmer Raids, when immigrants were rounded up and deported without trial. Today, Palestinian students like Mahmoud Khalil have been detained by ICE for nothing more than their status and activism. We saw it in COINTELPRO’s campaigns against Martin Luther King Jr., the Black Panthers and the American Indian Movement. Today, the same suspicion and surveillance are directed at anything branded “DEI.” It has become a new shorthand for movements the powerful want dismantled. Those who resisted were surveilled, shamed or silenced. The names have changed, but the tactics have not.At Duke, the past year proved no different as the institution responded with control. Protesters were asked to submit their resistance for approval. A policy was passed requiring 15 days' notice before students could demonstrate dissent. Students who interrupted the former Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit’s lecture were swiftly investigated under the new Pickets, Protests and Demonstrations (PPD) policy — and disciplined not for violence, but for raising their voices.Many argued that this policy placed academic freedom itself in jeopardy by subordinating conscience to compliance. The University may not have sent armed guards, but it sent emails, guidelines and deadlines. Bureaucracy became its muzzle. Requiring a 15-day notice for dissent was framed as “standard procedure,” yet history reminds us that such standards are never neutral. During the Civil Rights Movement, permits and paperwork were routinely used to delay or deny protest — tools of containment dressed up as consistency. Duke’s rules mirror the same: not outright bans, but preemptive restraints that disciplined students into compliance long before they ever act. There is something almost comical about reducing resistance to a calendar request, but beneath the irony lies the deeper truth: the University’s priority was not dialogue or care, but control in the presence of conscience.In the face of silence and control, we found new ways to speak. Our defiance became discipline, our witness became liturgy. We tabled when others could not. We built displays tying our struggles. We were Jewish, Muslim, Christian and agnostic. What united us was not identity but building solidarity to preserve our sanity in a world that is not what it ought to be. When the institution failed, we found each other. For five days on the quad, around the one-year anniversary of October 7, we participated in a die-in, and read and wrote out the names of 40 thousand people killed in Gaza — those we knew of — aware that thousands more remained unnamed, unknown, unheard. Our practice echoed the long history of resistance through ritual: AIDS activists staging die-ins to protest lives lost, students reading the names of soldiers killed in Vietnam and anti-lynching advocates inscribing the names of victims into public memory. Each act declared that lives erased by power and empire would still be remembered by Koinonia. I cannot credit the University for the Koinonia I found here. Duke did not give me my moral conscience, but it did show me that my moral conscience is all I have left. Students should be brought together with the support of the University, but instead, we were bound together by its absence of radical imagination. The University did not foster our solidarity — it forced it into being. And yet, Koinonia will always find one another. It is small but mighty — a remnant of the 7000. Like Elijah, we cried out. And we found the others who had not bowed.Hima Bindu Thota is a 2025 graduate from Duke Divinity School and a general surgery resident at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. "
"If you are born here, you do belong here — and we must say it full stop",Isaac Velez,2025-09-12T09:00:00Z,Sep,12,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/if-you-are-born-here-you-do-belong-here-20250912.html,"Last week, the Duke Law Federalist Society hosted an event with the provocative title: “Born Here, Belong Here? A Constitutional Conversation on Citizenship by Birth” where the underpinnings of the Fourteenth Amendment were questioned. The amendment plainly states that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.” The Citizenship Clause is one of the clearest provisions in our Constitution. It is not ambiguous and to suggest otherwise is not an act of intellectual curiosity; rather, it is a form of intellectualized xenophobia. Reinterpreting this clause threatens the livelihood of immigrant families who have long been scapegoated under the guise of constitutional debate.Universities must remain places where public issues are debated, but there is a line between engaging in serious constitutional questions and advancing arguments rooted in xenophobic ideology with discriminatory purposes. Hosting people who question the foundation of birthright citizenship crosses that line because what it really challenges is whether our classmates, neighbors and friends, who happen to be the children of immigrants, belong at all.The Citizenship Clause was written in direct response to the Supreme Court’s infamous decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), which declared that Black Americans “had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.” By passing the Citizenship Clause, the enacting Congress sought to ensure that never again could Americans be denied belonging in their own country. That promise was tested in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), when the Supreme Court held that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants was a U.S. citizen. The Court made clear that the guarantee of birthright citizenship is a principle of equality under law and not confined to race or national origin. The Court understood that two children born in the same hospital, on the same day, should not face different futures depending on their parents’ immigration status.The questioning of American belonging at this event is not abstract. On his first day back in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and those here lawfully, on student or work visas. In June, this order reached the Supreme Court, where the majority ruled that federal judges can no longer issue universal injunctions, which would have blocked Trump’s order nationwide. In July, however, a federal judge issued a class-wide injunction, blocking enforcement of the order against the very group targeted, protecting all children born on or after February 20, 2025.The litigation continues, but the message of the executive order was unmistakable. It communicates that some children — because of who their parents are and where they come from — do not belong here. Latinos and Asians are the largest groups at risk from this distortion of the Constitution. Latinos comprise an estimated 74% of undocumented immigrants, 83% of temporary nonagricultural workers and 93% of temporary agricultural workers, who at any time may have children in this country. Asians comprise nearly 75% of international students and 85% of temporary specialty workers, who may have children in the U.S. while residing here. This is why questioning the foundations of birthright citizenship and sharing these ideas is not simply a harmless thought experiment. Normalizing this discourse has the effect of advancing a racist and xenophobic effort by the current administration because, if implemented, it would create a permanent underclass of predominantly Latino and Asian US-born children who would not have their birth country recognize them as citizens under its laws, stripping them of the benefits of citizenship. A distorted interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment would lead to 255,000 American-born children each year being rendered nationless. By 2045, an estimated 2.7 million American children would be nationless. Parents should not have to explain to their children that their birth country does not think they belong in it. What was particularly jarring to me about this event was not only the premise, but its food menu: burritos, tortilla chips and salsa. While hosting a conversation about a legal idea that threatens the children of Latino immigrants, the organizers relied on foods rooted in Latino culture to feed the room. Apparently, Latino culture belongs on the table, just not in the country. I respectfully ask my classmates and colleagues across Duke and in universities across the country to ask what kind of conversations should we foster — do we want to cultivate dialogue that is rigorous, innovative and rooted in respect? Or do we want to give validity to ludicrous arguments that threaten the belonging of our fellow Americans?Isaac Velez is the president of the Duke Law Democrats and a J.D. candidate at Duke Law School."
"Who the hell cares what Jerry Seinfeld thinks, anyway?",Leo Goldberg,2025-09-12T09:00:00Z,Sep,12,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/who-the-hell-cares-what-jerry-seinfeld-thinks-anyway-20250912.html,"On Tuesday, Jerry Seinfeld once again graced our campus with his presence by making a surprise appearance at an event featuring former Israeli hostage Omer Shev Tov. The impromptu nature of his visit is likely due to the fact that he didn’t want to face the crowd of student protesters that would have inevitably materialized had his presence been announced. What could have been a perfectly good opportunity to hear an important story from a victim of the October 7th attacks (a story which, make no mistake, is harrowing and unequivocally worth hearing) was ruined by Seinfeld’s decision to spontaneously make a series of contemptible remarks to Duke students.In an incredibly lazy attack on those who support the Free Palestine movement, Seinfeld encouraged such supporters to just admit that they “don't like Jews,” and give in to their obviously uncontrollable and all-consuming anti-semitism. He continued by insulting the intelligence of the Duke students in the audience, not by “likening” the Free Palestine movement to the KKK, as was reported by The Chronicle, but rather by contrasting it as worse than the KKK. This is not the first time Seinfeld has stirred controversy on Duke’s campus. Last year, over 100 students in the class of 2024 walked out of his commencement address in protest of his unwavering support of Israel. Yet, despite his record of displeasure among the student body, Tuesday’s demonstration continued to prove the outsized pull that Seinfeld has with Duke, which allows him to get free press at the University whenever he feels like it. Seinfeld’s combination of familial ties and fame, it seems, entitles him to waltz into Duke as he pleases and be given a mantle from which to espouse ludicrous views as if he represents the University or its student body. His remarks prove the urgency with which we must divorce ourselves from this pattern, and him. There are many reasons outside of Tuesday’s comments for this, like the fact that he dated a 17 year old high school girl when he was 38 years old. Or perhaps the greatest sin of all, which is the fact that he isn’t funny. His recent comments, though, are what demand attention. First, one must dispel early on Seinfeld’s outrageous assertion that standing against the oppression of Palestinians equates to anti-semitism. Likening the protest of genocide, apartheid and illegal territory annexation with the endemic and historic hatred of another people is preposterous. The zero-sum argument that supporting the self-determination of the Palestinians somehow equates to denigrating the human rights of Jews should tell you all you need to know about the goals of those who are all too willing to deploy it. The corollary to this is the toxic idea that any criticism of Israel, and of its murderous military actions, can be silenced under the heading of ethnic hatred. Anointing the rule and actions of a state with unconditional immunity because of the identity of those who live there is nonsensical. Beyond that, it is dangerously reckless in granting permission to the state to do whatever it pleases. Not only does Seinfeld show his eagerness to embrace such recklessness by adopting this claim as his own, but he also slanders both the historical seriousness of antisemitism and the nuanced historical relationship of Jews and Israel in the process.I won’t get too deep into history or theology, but there are a few simple points worth making here. There was once a time when the vast majority of Jews were anti-Zionists. Prominent historical figures like Edwin Montagu, once the only Jewish member of the British cabinet, spurned the idea of a Jewish state in Palestine for its implication that European Jews (like himself) belonged in the Middle East. Since Zionism’s inception, there have existed and continue to exist sects of Judaism, such as the Neturei Karta and Satmar, who are vehemently anti-Zionist on the grounds that Israel itself is a blasphemy of the Torah. There are numerous highly esteemed Jews who have nothing but criticism to offer for Israel, such as Noam Chomsky, who denounces Israel’s actions in Palestine as worse than those of South Africa during apartheid. All of these Jews, apparently, are guilty of antisemitism too, according to Seinfeld. People who indulge in this kind of sloppy sophistry insult the seriousness of antisemitism. But Tuesday’s appearance was worse than that, because Seinfeld didn’t stop there. Not content with only insulting the underrated cohort of free-thinking Jews on campus as well as those who take a stand for Palestinian rights, he proceeded to make the incredibly insensitive remark towards Duke’s African American students that the tactics of Free Palestine should be regarded as worse than those of the Ku Klux Klan.It takes a special type of audacity to come to a school that has the racial history that Duke does and make a comment like that. Duke, as a predominantly white, wealthy school in the South, has a troubling history of anti-Black racism. James B. Duke, the University’s founder, was the son of a slave owner. His statue sits in front of the Chapel overlooking Abele Quad, named after the African American architect Julian Abele, who was responsible for designing Duke’s most pristine buildings from 1924-54.We wouldn’t have the university we do today without Abele’s artistic ingenuity. Yet, despite contributing immensely to Duke’s design, Abele’s accomplishments were swept under the rug until 1986 due to the embedded culture of racism and segregation at the time. As remarked by Bella Naspinski in her opinion column in 2023, “Every beautiful building Duke attributes its notability to was built by a Black man, yet he wasn’t the one immortalized by a statue.” This is the history against which Jerry Seinfeld wants to invoke the KKK to describe Duke students who are protesting the mass human rights violations of the Palestinian people. It was an incredibly insensitive remark to make, the preposterousness of which is multiplied when looking at which side Seinfeld likened the KKK to.Would not the crazed, Messianic Israeli colonizers of the West Bank, who regularly murder unarmed Palestinians and burn their homes and agricultural plots to build illegal colonies on stolen land, be a better candidate for comparison to the KKK? According to Seinfeld, no. It is those who question them who deserve the comparison.There is a real genocide being committed in Gaza, and the entire concept of free speech is being destroyed by silencing those who object to it into submission with moral blackmail. At a time like this, when the stakes are so high, I don’t understand why we are listening to political hacks who say that supporters of Palestine should just admit they hate all Jews, yet have verbatim been caught saying, “I don't care about Palestine.” By his own analogy, why doesn’t Seinfeld just admit that he hates all Muslims? There are far more worthy individuals who could be a face for Duke, and I see no reason why Duke students should continue to care about the opinion of someone who has so little regard for intellectual honesty.

"A birthday card, deli and a pair of flip flops",Kareena Sukhnanan,2025-09-11T10:00:00Z,Sep,11,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/a-birthday-card-deli-and-a-pair-of-flip-flops-20250911.html,"We say “never forget,” but sometimes, those words sit timidly — like a thin film of water covering a hollow gap in the sidewalk. Profound enough to reflect something back at you, yet shallow enough to trip over without warning. But, never deep enough to reveal the damage within the foundation.September 11th is embedded into calendars, textbooks and headlines, but how often do we pause to remember the quiet, lived realities of the people who endured it? The victims whose lives ended, who carried trauma home and the ordinary choices that shaped completely unpredictable futures — those stories don’t always seem to make the cut in history books and headlines.Born and raised in New York, I often felt like 9/11 was everywhere, yet somehow invisible. It wasn’t just a historical event in textbooks or footage on a screen you could show in class — it was part of my family’s story, and of the person closest to me: my mom.My mom survived the attacks while working in an office just behind the Twin Towers. She left for work early that morning to buy a birthday card — a small act that unknowingly put her life in danger. As she wandered through the predictable aisles of a standard Hallmark store located in Tower 2, the unexpected happened.Someone had told her the world was ending. She thought they must be crazy. Then, there were screams of terror — the kind you’ll never forget.My mom immediately dropped her cards and ran — in her flip-flops — for her life. She ran through chaos and ash with fear not only in her eyes but, most notably, in her heart. A once familiar city around her seemed unrecognizable — subway lines had ground to a halt, the air was thick with soot, her clothes covered in ash and each breath held a choking sting of smoke lodged deep in her lungs, sharp and suffocating with every inhale. She ran as far as she could, driven by a single, desperate thought: to put distance between herself and the chaos that she was stuck within. But between the chaos were her flip-flops, thin soles stuck stubbornly to the bottoms of her feet with every step, as if the city itself were holding her back. Each step was a reminder that survival came with friction; that escape is never simple. What felt like a storm chasing her own shadow carried her into a small deli. She ran in. She lunged toward the counter, begging to use their phone — to call family, to turn on the news, to make reality of it all. The workers stared at her blankly, as if she had lost her mind, their faces lodged between a layer of disbelief and fear. Finally, they gave her their phone. In that moment, the line between ordinary routines and a nation in flames became painfully visible, a chasm that separated normalcy from survival in a city full of promises. Shortly after, she returned to work amidst the wreckage of what we now call “Ground Zero.” Like many New Yorkers at the time, she forged her way through the pain back into what she so desperately wanted to be normal. Eventually, she broke down. She — along with countless others — was trying to live normally in a city still reeling from the morning's devastation, finding it impossible to simply “move on” right away in a city draped in ash, debris and the echoes of loss.My mom, an immigrant from Guyana and the first in her family to enter the world of higher education, carved a path in finance with the chisels of intelligence, determination and grit. In the aftermath of 9/11, she made a decision that seemed quiet yet loud: she left her career to dedicate herself to raising my sister and me.I was born on September 7, 2004 — four days before the anniversary of the wreckage. My mom begged the doctor not to let me be born on the 11th, not because she feared the date itself, but because she wanted a life for her child that wasn’t immediately shadowed by disaster. That concern — that foresight — shaped the earliest part of my life.She became a steady anchor in our lives, pouring herself into our education and building a bridge of stability — even when the shadows of trauma from that day lingered behind her. I grew up at the kitchen table, watching her juggle strength and sacrifice, guiding me through math worksheets and quizzing me on every multiplication table. Because of her, I stand at Duke now, the first in our family to be afforded an opportunity like this — carrying forward the quiet courage she modeled with every choice.In middle school, I visited the 9/11 Memorial with my mom for a US history extra credit project. As we reached bedrock level, about 70 feet underground, I looked up and saw a wall of blue — Spencer Finch’s installation “Trying to Remember the Color of the Sky on That September Morning.” Each of the 2,983 tiles held a continuous yet distinct shade of blue. Standing there, I visualized the collective memory of the sky that morning, painted in color. I felt the weight of what had happened in a way no textbook or video could convey. Each square seemed to pulse with the memory of a life lived, a story now held in that shade of blue. I remember the realization of how fragile life can be — how my perception of every ordinary moment became altered, more precious. I came to understand that this was not just a story of my mom’s survival, but a collective legacy of trauma and resilience — one discussed mostly as history, not as lived experience. An experience that rarely escaped the walls of my home.In fear conditioning, a traumatic event hyperactivates the amygdala. Impaired regulation from the prefrontal cortex fails to suppress this response, the hippocampus struggles to contextualize the memory and dysregulated VTA–nucleus accumbens dopamine signaling can alter motivation and reinforcement. Together, these changes produce persistent fear, hyperarousal and maladaptive memory associations. As I stare at the PowerPoint slides for my neuroscience class, “Looking Inside the Disordered Brain”, I see something as nuanced as PTSD reduced to a simplistic flow diagram. Ironically, this concept is named “classical” fear conditioning, despite the fact that most causes are anything but.This isn’t just a story of resilience; it is a story of intergenerational investment. It is a reminder that privilege, opportunity and success often come hand in hand with the sacrifices made by those who came before you.Every September, when the world remembers the towers, I remember the quiet choices, the hidden sacrifices, and the persistence that defined my life. I see not only what was lost, but what was built from the foundation up. My mom’s survival is part of my story — but so is her decision to prioritize our lives, our education and our future.That is the story I carry with me at Duke: one of gratitude, awareness, and purpose. Survival alone is not the lesson — it is how we live afterward that matters. The legacy we create by continuing, every day, is important. As Winston S. Churchill once said: “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”"
Luis Juárez shows how all politics is personal,"Leo Goldberg, Harrison Walley",2025-09-08T14:00:00Z,Sep,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/luis-jurez-shows-how-all-politics-is-personal-20250908.html,"There seems to exist at Duke an underlying, and frustrating, apathy towards politics and current events. Despite having one of the strongest public policy programs in the country, and practically every other student you ask majoring in it, it feels as though there is a strange detachment among Duke students from national political events, which one would expect them to care more about. This past summer, however, several major actions of the Trump administration that directly harmed Duke, including $108 million in research cuts, mass staff layoffs and bogus federal legal investigations, began to spur student interest. As a result, people finally seemed to wake up and pay more attention to the world around them as our University found itself caught in the political crosshairs. Despite this initial hype, though, the typical attitude of political indifference soon reappeared over issues which, to many, seemed distant, unrelatable and impersonal. That all abruptly changed last week when news broke that the beloved C1 bus driver, Luis Alonso Juárez, a Honduran immigrant, is facing the prospect of deportation under the Trump administration’s immigration policies. It’s hard to overstate the impact this announcement has had on campus. For the student body, the news has been profoundly shaking, and it’s easy to see why. There is hardly a student at Duke who hasn’t been positively impacted by Luis, whether it’s via a friendly conversation, a jam session on the party C1, or simply being able to get from East to West efficiently. For many students, Luis is also a close friend and someone with whom they have a deep, meaningful connection. The Chronicle's story on Luis’ situation trended on the webpage for almost an entire week after its publication, an extremely unusual occurrence. Luis’s case represents a central paradox when examining how Duke students are so invested in his personal circumstance, yet simultaneously so disinvested in the national policy decisions that brought it about. Luis is a sobering reminder of something that Duke students are all too prone to forgetting: All politics is personal. Too often on campus, students prefer to avoid thinking or speaking critically about politics because it doesn’t affect them personally. They prefer to look at policy in terms of what is most lucrative for them, rather than on its actual implications. This naive attitude, unfortunately, is one that the Duke administration itself adopted regarding Trump’s higher education policy and its impact on university funding. And, surprise, surprise, it blew up in their faces. When people are fortunate enough to evade the brunt of bad policy, they complacently fall into apathy until such policy eventually comes to directly harm their lives, too. When it came to Luis, Duke students blindly took refuge in the idea that “we could never have seen this coming,” despite Trump’s campaign promise to initiate “the largest deportation operation in the history of our country."" Such insouciance has directly put the livelihoods of people like Luis at risk, to say nothing of the many other Hispanic immigrants at Duke and beyond whose legal statuses are likewise at risk. Time and time again, our detachment from pressing issues fuels the fire of the Trump administration's abhorrent policies. It abets the effectiveness with which the administration was able to rip one of our closest community members away from us. The willingness to ignore insidious, nativist-driven political decisions because “it doesn’t affect me” has encouraged Trump to destroy the lives of Americans however he pleases, because no one cares enough to do anything about it. For a school that so heavily emphasizes policy, we must do better at actually interacting with its real-world impacts. Luis should serve as a wake-up call for Duke students, especially those who immerse themselves in the ""PubPol"" craze. Policy is not some fanciful, money-making opportunity that involves your freshman year Public Policy 155 lecture followed by a handsome, six-figure job offer at a consulting firm with nothing in between. It has real, tangible consequences that affect us all. It determines whether people like Luis have the right to continue bettering their community, or be callously forced to return to a country they have not lived in for 30 years. Luis is a core part of the Duke community, and, should he be forced to leave his home of three decades to stroke Trump’s ego and fuel his increasingly xenophobic rhetoric, it will be a deep loss to our campus. The passion with which Duke students have attempted to protect his legal status and keep him in the United States over the last week has been truly encouraging. But in a scenario that was a long time coming, it was simply too little too late. Too many people ignored the warning signs and gave in to political apathy. Now, we are dealing with the consequences.

Keep a-inchin’ along,Luke A. Powery,2025-09-08T09:00:00Z,Sep,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/keep-a-inchin-along-20250908.html,"Walking gets a lot of attention for being good for one’s health — body and mind. At a university constructed in a forest, there are many beautiful trails for taking a walk. It is good for the spirit, too. Those who are champions for the “Camino de Santiago” pilgrimage in Spain understand this very well. Walking can be a spiritual pilgrimage. Sacred texts tell stories of people walking on a road when suddenly the divine shows up in their presence.We may take walking for granted. After all, we walk daily from class to class, lab to lab, meeting to meeting. In my vocation, we often walk down the middle aisle in churches and call this a liturgical procession; and yes, that aisle at Duke Chapel is long!Historically, there have also been walks on streets and bridges, like the Edmund Pettis Bridge in Selma, Alabama, where individuals and groups marched for liberty and justice for all.In her book “Wanderlust: A History of Walking”, Rebecca Solnit tells us about the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo in Argentina. These mothers came together as a group when their children began to be disappeared by the military junta that seized power in 1976. The abductions happened quietly and in secret “beneath a veneer of normalcy.” These moms, with little education and political experience, began to gather at the Plaza de Mayo in the center of Buenos Aires, the same place where Argentina declared its independence in 1810. Fourteen mothers gathered for the first time on April 30, 1977, but could not sit there. Sitting together would be seen as holding an illegal meeting and so they ingeniously began to walk around the obelisk in the center of the plaza. They walked every Friday as a form of protest. As their numbers increased each week, the police began to notice. Groups of policemen would arrive, take their names and force them to leave. These mothers were attacked by dogs and clubs, arrested and interrogated. But the mothers kept returning to the plaza. They marched with photographs of their children on posters or hung around their necks. Some wore white kerchiefs embroidered with the names of their disappeared children and the dates of their disappearances. These women would not allow loveless amnesia to set in as they walked in remembrance of their loved ones. They processed the national trauma in public as a social critique of the regime. By 1980, these women had a whole network of mothers around the country, and in 1981, they began the first of their annual 24 hour marches to celebrate Human Rights Day. A number of journalists from across the world covered the marches. Eventually, the military junta fell in 1983 and the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo were honored guests at the inauguration of the newly elected president. Walking, marching or processing can be a form of human activism, and not just a leisure or exercise activity. It can be a daring act in the face of frightening domination by bringing that which is silent to voice and makes the hidden revealed in public. It makes what has been missing, ignored or forgotten a part of the human story. It reveals that there is another way to live, lead and love. Walking, in this vein, is ultimately, a practice for public health.Never underestimate a walk. It may not just make you healthier but make society more whole. So keep a-inchin’ along for truth and justice, because we make society better — and healthier — one step at a time.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel.

Duke must stand with its immigrant service workers,"Leila Zak, Suhhyun Lee, Luis Pereira-Lazo",2025-09-04T10:00:00Z,Sep,4,Letters To The Editor,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-must-stand-with-its-immigrant-service-workers-20250904.html,"Duke Beyond Borders, a student organization advocating for justice for immigrants, refugees and asylum-seekers in the United States, stands in firm solidarity with Duke’s immigrant service workers and urges the university to defend their rights in the face of unjust rulings and rhetoric from the federal administration. Our immigrant service workers are not disposable. They are not replaceable. They are essential, beloved members of our community who bring vibrancy and care to our campus and who have built lives and families here in the US. A number of immigrant service workers at Duke are currently on Temporary Protected Status (TPS). TPS is a program permitting migrants of designated nationalities to reside and work lawfully in the US when conditions in their home countries are deemed too dangerous or unstable for return. Duke’s immigrant service workers do all that they can to ensure students and faculty can live and thrive in a safe, clean and lively space. Beyond their labor, they are often a lifeline for students of immigrant, lower-income and first-generation backgrounds. They give students of immigrant heritage reminders of home, and are eager to connect across cultural divides. The friendships and connections they make with students are deeply treasured, often spanning across and beyond our university years. The Department of Homeland Security’s recent termination of TPS for Hondurans and Nicaraguans will place over 75,000 individuals, including members of our University community, at immediate risk of deportation and devastating family separations. The ruling will strip them of work authorization, cruelly uproot them from communities they have spent decades contributing to, and prompt forcible return to now-unfamiliar countries still reeling from emergent humanitarian needs.Beyond Borders refuses to stand by as hardworking community members are targeted by the federal government’s agenda and denied the right to live and work safely in the US. Beyond Borders calls upon Duke to take every measure to defend its immigrant service workers, including those on TPS, and honor the service they devote to the university day in and day out. Duke must stand with its immigrant service workers. Without them, our University could not stand at all.Leila Zak is the internal chair of Duke Beyond Borders.Luis Pereira-Lazo and Suhhyun Lee are the co-presidents of Duke Beyond Borders."
Great day!,Luke A. Powery,2025-08-25T16:00:00Z,Aug,25,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/great-day-20250825.html,"It is a great day! The start of another semester at Duke. New classes, new friends, new clubs, new knowledge, new possibilities, new experiences. It is a great day!There is a spiritual — a religious folk song created by enslaved Black people — that is titled “Great Day!”Like many spirituals do, this one takes up themes or images from the Bible and uses those literary sources as an inspiration to create a song for a community. Here are some of the lyrics:“Great day! Great day! the righteous marchin'Great day! God's a-gonna build up Zion's wallsGreat day! Great day! the righteous marchin'Great day! God's a-gonna build up Zion's walls”I have studied the spirituals, and what strikes me is how they were forged during brutal, inhumane slavery — created by the enslaved, the oppressed, those treated as non-human. Out of such inhumanity, we receive a great gift for humanity. These songs inspired James Weldon Johnson, a key literary artist of the Harlem Renaissance, to write a poem in honor of them in 1922, “O Black and Unknown Bards.” He captures the miracle of these songs when he writes,“There is a wide, wide wonder in it all,That from degraded rest and servile toilThe fiery spirit of the seer should callThese simple children of the sun and soil.O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed…You sang far better than you knew; the songsThat for your listeners' hungry hearts sufficedStill live…”That is, they still resonate with the human experience regardless of who you are or where you come from. They are spiritual songs, touching and reaching the human spirit. There is rich wisdom for life from the musical sages of the oppressed.These songs were created and sung during struggle and are melodies of melancholy yet also of joy and hope. It’s interesting that they could sing “great day!” even when enduring horrible days. This song is an expression of hope, the “great day,” of liberation from bondage. These folk songs represent what Durham’s own Pauli Murray said in a poem — “Hope is a song in a weary throat.” These spirituals sound hope as a form of resistance. They resist evil, injustice, despair, pessimism, and human suffering, and through song, the bards assert their humanity even while others try to strip it from them.To sing “great day” today on the first day of classes is not to ignore human suffering in the world, the nation, the Triangle or at Duke. But rather, it is an act of defiance. It is a choice to say, “great day,” or as my father wrote, “It’s a beautiful day, I will rejoice and be glad in it.” Of course, you can almost anticipate ups and downs this semester, just as you can in life in general. That’s being honest and true. But you can still decide and sing, “great day!”Just to be alive — great day! To experience the beauty of Duke’s campus — great day! To be reunited with friends and colleagues — great day! To learn something new in a class — great day! To have a mind-blowing, heart-stirring conversation in a dorm hallway — great day! To have a belly laugh at a table in the Brodhead Center — great day! To go for a jog on the Al Buehler trail — great day! To listen to the carillon bells ring from the Chapel at 5 p.m. — great day!There are so many reasons to have a great day at Duke. So on this first day of the semester, make today a great one and strive to make every day a “great day” because it is. Stop me on campus, if you see me. I look forward to hearing about how your first day went. I hope and pray it’s great.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel. His column runs on alternate Mondays."
Community members share farewells for departing staff,Opinion,2025-08-16T00:30:00Z,Aug,16,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/community-members-share-farewells-for-departing-staff-20250816.html,"Derek LeadbetterMy name is Chaoran Yang. I am an undergraduate senior at Duke. I write today to honor and recognize the contribution of Derek Leadbetter, the Physics lab manager, whose guidance let me uncover— and steadfastly nurture —the best of who I am today. I first met Derek during Summer 2023, when I took Physics 141. He brought out a Hoberman sphere — a toy that expands and collapses into a geodesic ball — and hung it from the ceiling on a string. He gave it a spin, then tugged the string. The sphere collapsed inward and spun faster and faster. “Imagine this were a star collapsing into a black hole,” the lecturing professor narrated from the side of the room. It’s hard now to recreate what I felt then, as someone who had never taken physics before. But I know that single moment pushed me, a history major who had carefully sidestepped every STEM requirement in high school, into a double major in math and physics. That summer, every other lecture, Derek would emerge from the shelves of the demo lab with a new toy: pendulums, gyroscopes, ducks walking by shifting their center of mass, tubes that sang when spun like lassos, music boxes, lightbulbs, and, of course, eclipse glasses through which we watched the 2024 solar eclipse.When my friends had to miss class, they always asked about the demos. I’d draw diagrams that evolved into comics and later a comic collection titled “Derek and the Demo Lab.” Physics is fun. Being a physics major is not. Especially at Duke, where most peers arrive already seasoned. I was no prodigy. I used to joke that Derek and a few others were the only professors who believed in me. (“We’re staff, not professors,” one of them once corrected. “Fine,” I said, “then none of the professors believe in me!”)I nearly failed six classes. I asked myself daily whether it was worth staying in the major. In those moments, I would slip into an intro physics class, watch a demo, and remind myself of that Hoberman that started it all. The choice for me was never between being good or bad at physics. It was between being bad at physics or not being at all.Even now, as I slowly improve, Derek’s demo lab remains my refuge. Free from homework, exams, grades and evaluations; free from side glances at my peers during lectures who all seem to “get it.” This is where physics remains the playground for creativity and wonder. My story is not a typical Duke story. It doesn’t contain basketball or K-ville or tenting. Instead, there were long conversations about life, family, immigration, and friends. Banging nails into pieces of wood to make demos. Shattering glass with high frequency sound. Making ice cream with liquid nitrogen. Hanging a map of the world upside down because New Zealand deserves a moment to be on top. Swimming, knee braces, road signs, “would you like to keep this when I’m gone?” I didn’t go to the department’s farewell party. It didn’t feel like my place. Over the summer, while students were gone, the university quietly decided who was “necessary” and who wasn’t. They delivered the news to Derek in the lab room downstairs — the same room where I had once cried through doubt, found comfort in the demos, and repeated to myself, I am, I am. There, they decided Derek was unnecessary. The corner of campus I had so carefully chosen, where belonging felt like a flicker of possibility, was the very corner that they chose to dismantle. I picked up the Hoberman sphere. The old treasure retired due to various broken bits, so it was all mine. I still remember when Derek handed it to me. “This is when your physics journey started?” “Yes,” I looked at him in disbelief. “And you asked once whether you could have it after you graduate.” “Yes but I was joking! Also I’m not graduating this summer.” “... Have you heard what a VSIP is?” Goodbye Derek. Thank you for all the wonderful adventures. To future students at Duke: I hope you find physics as fascinating as I did. But I say this with hesitation, because with Derek, it was always more possible.Chaoran Yang is a Trinity senior.Ernest ""Erik"" ZitserMy name is James Nealy. I attended Duke University as a graduate student in the history department between 2014 and 2022. I write today to honor and recognize the contribution of Dr. Ernest ""Erik"" Zitser, the Slavic librarian at Duke, to my success and intellectual development.Erik was one of the first people I met at Duke when I attended the history department's recruitment weekend (held for students accepted to Duke's rigorous and selective Ph.D. program in history) in February of 2014. I was immediately struck by Erik's kindness and the enthusiasm he has for his profession; it was very clear to me that Dr. Zitser takes seriously his role as a steward of Slavic, Eurasian and East European culture. Subject librarians — those who possess a specific expertise in a particular field — are crucial to the success of graduate students. This is certainly the case for those of us who conduct research in the Foreign Service Institute designated ""Category IV"" (that is, classified as ""hard"" for native English speakers) languages such as Russian. Ultimately, I accepted Duke's offer — one of several I received — in part because I knew that I could rely on Dr. Zitser for support.He did not disappoint. Thanks to the work of Dr. Zitser, virtually every major Soviet publication — including relatively obscure ones — needed to conduct original research was available to me either at the press of a button, for digitized sources, or a simple request, for bound collections. By 2017, I thought I had found a dissertation topic: the history of Soviet sociology. Erik patiently helped me to locate key materials that would later serve as the basis of my first peer-reviewed publication, which appeared in the Winter 2022 edition of Kritika: explorations in Russian and Eurasian history, one of the top journals in the field.However, I ultimately decided to pursue another topic for my dissertation. My new project, an interrogation of the Soviet economy through the study of a single factory located in provincial Russia, required that I venture to archives outside of Russia's major cities i.e., Moscow and St. Petersburg. Erik helped me to locate relevant repositories and to navigate their respective archive guides. Thanks in part to his help, I was awarded a Fulbright-Hays doctoral dissertation research abroad award, an achievement which the Duke University Graduate School celebrated on its website. In 2017, I became the first non-Russian researcher to conduct archive research at the State Archive of the Tula Region in Tula, Russia. My presence was significant enough to locals that a half-page article — complete with a photograph — was featured in a regional newspaper; wherein I, of course, mentioned that I was a student at Duke. When I left Tula in the summer of 2018, the archive's director gifted me a collection of books — including archive guides and scholarly monographs — published by the state archives in cooperation with other institutions. When I got back to Durham, I met with Dr. Zitser to donate those books to Duke University Libraries. He eagerly accepted them; we both discussed our hope that they would prove useful for future researchers interested in the history of Russia in general and Tula in particular.With research completed I set out to write the dissertation, and Dr. Zitser was not yet done helping me. I had a very difficult time completing the seventh chapter. I searched far and wide for inspiration. I knew of one possible publication — a dissertation defended by a Russian scholar in 2011 — that might help. I consulted with Erik, who used his connections abroad to first locate a copy of the work and then purchase it for me (and, of course, the Blue Devils of the future). It was just what I needed. I successfully defended my dissertation a few months later. To date, it has won three awards. While serving as a world-class subject librarian, Dr. Zitser maintains an active research agenda. His work, “The Transfigured Kingdom: Sacred Parody and Charismatic Authority at the Court of Peter the Great” is a classic in the historiography of Imperial Russia. More recently, he has published in The Russian Review and The American Historical Review. With the exception of 2017 and 2018, I have attended the Association of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies Annual Convention every year, where Erik has always presented exciting research on topics ranging from Peter the Great to new source collections to Raphael Lemkin's ""interlude"" at Duke in 1941-1942. I do not know where he finds the energy or the time. Since my graduation in 2022, I have held fellowships at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Weatherhead Initiative on Global History at Harvard University and the Jordan Center for the Advanced Study of Russia at New York University. The dissertation I defended at Duke will soon become a book and early next year, an article based on the dissertation will appear in a collection of essays I co-edited. Nothing I accomplished at Duke — the publications, the successful defense, the fellowships, the awards — would have been possible without Dr. Ernest ""Erik"" Zitser. What it is that Erik does for Duke and its students cannot be understood in crude terms of cost effectiveness. And that is precisely as it should be: the pursuit of knowledge (to say nothing of culture and the human spirit) is invariably and hopelessly degraded when disciplined by the vulgarity of the balance sheet. I am saddened that future Blue Devils will not benefit from the guidance, patience, and brilliance of Dr. Zister. And I mourn for the future of Slavic Studies at Duke.

Such atrocious policy even incurred the displeasure of Senate Republicans, who expressed disagreement with the very bills on which they voted affirmatively, done so out of cowardice and deference to President Donald Trump. Clearly, there is no evidence to be found in the spineless Republican party of anyone willing to prevent our country’s slow descent into fascism, and the last six months of national incompetence have demonstrated the need for a massive reckoning when considering the 2026 midterm elections.

Last month, incumbent North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis announced he was not seeking re-election to the Senate, setting the stage for one of the most competitive congressional races in the nation. In response, after weeks of anticipation, former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper announced his bid to fill the vacant seat last Monday. In doing so, Cooper broke a fundraising record by accumulating $3.4 million in the first 24 hours of his announcement, and gave the Democratic Party a popular, household name in NC to send to Congress. Cooper is the obvious candidate whom any responsible voter ought to send to the Senate in 2026, not just on the principle that everything possible must be done to stop Trump, but because of the virtues he will bring to a Congress in desperate need of it. His record as governor was one of delivering to his constituents exactly what congressional Republicans are dedicating their political lives to undermining. Cooper expanded Medicaid for 600,000 North Carolinians, increased teacher pay by 19%, invested over $1 billion in childcare and cemented North Carolina as a center for clean energy. It is these laudable accomplishments he will carry with him to a Republican Congress, which is daily trying to tear them — and the very power of the legislative branch — down in pathetic obeisance to Trump.Beyond 2026, though, Cooper’s candidacy may cause substantial ripples in North Carolina’s political demography on the national stage, which has thwarted Democrats for over a decade. North Carolina has long been a pipe dream for Democrats, and a sore spot when it comes to dreams of electoral victory. The last time North Carolina voted for a Democrat for president was 2008, during Obama's first run. It has since given its electoral votes to the Republican candidate in every national presidential election. This was especially apparent in the 2024 presidential election, when hope was running high for Democrats to deliver a blue North Carolina for Kamala Harris. Instead, though, North Carolina “broke Democrats’ hearts” in the words of New York Times columnist and Duke professor Frank Bruni. The hopes of the purple state swinging to the left remain frustratingly elusive for national Democratic strategy. A similar story can be told for the state’s US Senators. The last time Democrats won a US Senate seat from North Carolina was also in 2008. Republicans have held the Class II Senate seat in North Carolina since 2015 in the person of Thom Tillis, and the Class III Senate seat for even longer, first with Richard Burr beginning in 2005, followed by Ted Budd, who replaced him in 2022. Oddly, though, the consistency with which Democrats have lost North Carolina nationally has been equal to their consistency in winning elections on the state executive level. Democrats have successfully clinched the governorship of North Carolina since 2016, when Cooper was first elected as governor, going on to win re-election in 2020 before being succeeded by his then-lieutenant governor, Josh Stein, by a comfortable margin against the laughable Mark Robinson. Thus, breaking the gridlock pattern of failing to deliver a blue North Carolina on the national level while taking the consolation prize of governorship has been the prime challenge for Democrats. So, the question now becomes: is Roy Cooper the one who can finally turn North Carolina blue on the national stage in 2026? He certainly seems the most capable of doing so, and, should he pull it off, he may very well become the model for Democratic electoral strategy in swing states for years to come.Getting Cooper elected will certainly impact national politics in 2026, and is key to halting the mad, fascistic reign of Trump. But even more broadly, Cooper’s win could inaugurate a fundamental transformation of North Carolina’s political demography, which could far outlast the upcoming election cycle, and put the Republicans on the defensive for a change. I crave that prospect, but in order for it to happen, Democrats have to stop being such god-awful politicians. For years, Democrats have been afraid of big ideas that are desperately needed in America, like massive investments in healthcare and education, and increased wages. Democratic leaders sabotage members of their own party who run campaigns from the left instead of the center. Establishment figures like Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, for example, have refused to endorse New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for being “too far left,” even though Mamdani is churning out uncommon enthusiasm among voters who are, on the whole, deeply disillusioned. Meanwhile, Trump and the Republican party have done the opposite, running on radical, ultra-conservative ideas like insane tax breaks for billionaires and mass deportations of immigrants from a country which, both economically and demographically, cannot survive without them. Such brio, however sinister it may be, certainly resonates with voters who are no longer fooled by establishment excuses and want to see elected officials do something for a change. Cooper should learn from this and realize that Democrats should get off their moral high horse and start fighting fire with fire. He should run diametrically opposed to Trump and everything his party is doing through the lens of their destructive, un-American way of governing, not their repugnant personalities, which are self-evident enough. We must realize that we are in the midst of a battle for the soul of our country, and the political response of Democrats to this will determine whether or not that soul lives on. Cooper must make clear he knows why, and how, he’s fighting to keep it alive. Leo Goldberg is a Trinity sophomore. His pieces typically run on alternate Mondays."
The costs of cost cutting and the Duke administration's misguided priorities,Orin Starn,2025-07-31T10:00:00Z,Jul,31,Letters To The Editor,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/costs-of-cost-cutting-20250731.html,"I write in dismay at the recent letter from top Duke administrators announcing further staff layoffs in the coming weeks. A frightening lack of transparency has marked this DOGE-style cost-cutting, and the University’s highest earners have been exempted from any sacrifice. President Vincent Price and the Duke Health and Duke Management Company heads will continue to take home over six million dollars a year between them. Our country club lawns must cost millions, too. Can no money be found anywhere to pay the hard-working staff in so many essential programs that are the best of Duke?It’s odd that our University higher-ups would congratulate themselves on their “respect and compassion” for the hundreds of Duke staff members being forced out. I don’t think many of those receiving “voluntary separation” slips after years of valiant service would agree about being treated kindly.These cuts gut campus mainstays. A flagship program, the University Scholars, has lost its fine director, Victoria Lodewick, despite a petition signed by more than fifty of its brilliant — often first-generation — students. Lodewick and others among the almost six hundred leaving Duke “voluntarily” felt they had no choice, given the likelihood of otherwise being laid off with reduced benefits. The libraries, Office of Information Technology (OIT), global studies, physics, and multiple other departments are seeing staffing being slashed. Our administration’s bland HR-speak acronymizes this chainsawing as a RIF, a Reduction in Force.As the Durham Rising campaign calls for us to see, the University must do better if we wish to be more than a corporatized finishing school for the global elite. Duke pays no property taxes, despite being Durham’s largest landowner. Seven billionaires sit on the Board of Trustees, and we have an eleven billion dollar endowment. We could rework budgeting to retain staff and kick in some support for city schools — or even, just as Columbia has done, fork over a few hundred shakedown millions to the Trump Administration to back off on threatened punitive action. It’s about priorities and values, and our vision of what the University should be.Let’s remember: Duke doesn’t exist to house a big-money NBA-feeder basketball team. Nor is our mission to win the grand Wall Street prize for the biggest university endowment. We’re a non-profit institution that ought to be dedicated to learning, free speech and service to society. Let’s try to have a university that runs in a more humane and democratic way.Orin Starn is a professor of cultural anthropology and history."
Setting the record straight on being a 'reverse discrimination' activist,Mark Perry,2025-07-29T10:00:00Z,Jul,29,Letters To The Editor,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/setting-the-record-straight-on-being-a-reverse-discrimination-activist-20250729.html,"In recent years, I have worked full-time challenging illegal sex and race discrimination in higher education. I have filed nearly 1,000 federal civil rights complaints with the Office for Civil Rights, alleging over 2,500 violations of Title VI and Title IX. Eight of those complaints were filed against Duke for cases of sex-based discrimination, including cases of sex discrimination against both men and women. The Chronicle has twice referred to me as a “prominent ‘reverse discrimination’ activist.” The first occasion was a September 18, 2023, article that profiled my civil rights complaint against Duke’s female-only Alice M. Baldwin Scholars program that excludes male students. Subsequently, the OCR found sufficient evidence of Duke’s sex discrimination and opened a federal civil rights investigation that is ongoing. On June 25, The Chronicle referenced my Title IX complaint against Duke’s Baldwin Scholars and again referred to me as a “prominent ‘reverse discrimination’ activist.” I object to being referred to as a “reverse discrimination” activist because it’s an inaccurate description of my civil rights efforts. By definition, reverse discrimination occurs when members of a majority experience discrimination. The Baldwin Scholars program is a case of sex discrimination against a minority group of students (men), not against the majority group (women). Nationally, men have been a minority in higher education for nearly 40 years, based on college enrollment and associate’s, bachelor’s, and master’s degrees. Women are currently 53% of Duke undergraduate students and have been the majority for nearly the last decade. Therefore, discrimination in favor of women, who are the majority of students at Duke, doesn’t meet the legal definition of ""reverse discrimination.” When discrimination is illegal, there is no need to qualify that discrimination with adjectives like “reverse,” which only obscures the fact that discrimination based on sex is prohibited according to Title IX, regardless of which sex is the victim of discriminatory practices.Mark Perry is a professor emeritus of economics and finance at the University of Michigan.

"Duke, keep your commitment to the University Scholars Program",Students and Alumni of the University Scholars Program,2025-07-22T10:00:00Z,Jul,22,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-keep-your-commitment-to-the-university-scholars-program-20250722.html,"On April 30, Duke announced the Voluntary Separation Incentive Program (VSIP) as a result of recent federal funding cuts to institutions of higher education. Victoria Lodewick, director of the University Scholars Program (USP), was one of numerous staff members to receive a VSIP offer. The USP program was established in 1998 thanks to a donation from Melinda French Gates, Trinity ‘86 and Fuqua ‘87, with the aim of providing scholarships to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students with financial need who are interested in interdisciplinary studies. Given that the program is funded by a restricted endowment, do we need to cut program staff to save costs at the University level? The USP hosts seminars for students to learn from speakers across disciplines, as well as an annual symposium. It also fosters relationships across the University’s schools by pairing undergraduate scholars with graduate and professional mentors, helping students at all levels refine their interests and career paths. Currently, there are no clear answers on what changes the USP would undergo if Lodewick departs the University, or if the USP director position is at risk of elimination. In response to a letter we sent to administrators, we were informed by Jenny Wood Crowley, assistant vice provost for intellectual community, on June 10 that the University intends to continue the program, but we remain uncertain that the program’s students and activities will receive adequate support in the future.For many of us, this program has been life-changing. It has been a space for intellectual exploration, academic support, and community. Alumni have remained connected with each other and the University long after departing. In addition to providing a way for low-income students to attend Duke, the USP has also been at the forefront of giving back to the Durham community. Bull City Scholars (BCS), an initiative that aims to provide mentorship to Durham middle school students, was created by University Scholars as a service-learning requirement and has grown into a larger organization with tangible impacts. Just this past year, Neal Middle School’s performance grade increased from an “F” to a “D” with the support of BCS tutors. The success of the USP and its contributions are largely because of Lodewick, who has been with the program for the majority of its existence and has shaped the welcoming culture that allowed many of us to thrive. As Jenny Chang-Wolf, Pratt ‘17 and School of Medicine ‘24, put it, “[Lodewick] is a glue; she makes the program what it is.” Chang-Wolf was one of several scholars who contributed to this video, which compiled the scholars’ personal stories with Lodewick and the USP. Scholars highlighted the individualized academic guidance Lodewick provided to students, adding another layer of support outside of our primary advisors and principal investigators, who may have other competing priorities. Her role in coordinating the USP’s flagship events allowed scholars to learn from each other and produce stronger problem sets, projects, and dissertations. She was also described as instrumental in helping students launch the aforementioned BCS initiative. “The USP and Tori Lodewick were the most valuable parts of my graduate school experience,” said Erin Gentry Lamb, Graduate School ‘08.Lodewick also advises scholars on navigating their financial situations and University resources. Many students who come through the program are first-generation and/or low-income, and she has helped many of these students find their footing at the University. This is especially the case for international scholars, who have felt strongly empowered by Lodewick and the program. Beyond receiving the financial assistance that is largely unavailable to international students, they’ve also received support in navigating life in the United States and found a built-in community away from home. She supports scholars in obtaining enrichment funding to pursue academic and professional opportunities, whether from the USP fund or other University sources. “I genuinely thought that certain dreams were impossible for someone like me, and Tori was the one who pulled me out of that,” said Amik Mandal, Trinity ‘21.We are concerned that VSIP would leave the USP without a director at all. Maintaining the Scholars’ financial security, providing mentorship for their unique financial situations, and cultivating their interdisciplinary spirit through seminars, meetings, and our annual symposium is a full-time job. It is a job that cannot be thrown haphazardly into another administrator’s portfolio without a serious threat to the well-being of the program.Preserving the University Scholars Program’s current structure with a dedicated program director is crucial to the success and well-being of future generations of Duke students, as well as aligning with French Gates’ vision for the program. We hope that the director will be Victoria Lodewick, but in the event that it cannot be, we demand that the University commit to filling the position as soon as possible.Signed, Students and Alumni of the University Scholars ProgramKatherine Redden, Divinity School '26Divyansh Jain, Trinity '26Nadia Bey, Trinity '23Devon Carter, Graduate School '25Jeffrey Letourneau, School of Medicine '22Aden Klein, Trinity '24Ezgi Ustundag, Trinity '16Hananiel Setiawan, Graduate School '23Roxanne (Flint) Rosenberg, Graduate School '11Aleksandr Andreev, Trinity '08Hadeel Abdelhy, Trinity '20Mariana Carrera, Trinity '04María Zurita Ontiveros, Trinity '21Spencer Eldred, Trinity '10Andrew S.

My friend needs science. Science needs help.,Albert Xue,2025-07-05T13:15:00Z,Jul,5,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/070425-xue-20250705.html,"When I met “Sean” my freshman year at Duke, we didn’t like each other much. He found me prickly, and I found him unfunny. Despite this, a shared need for help on statistics homework forced us into a grudging peace.Eight years later, I’m a graduate student studying genetics, and Sean is getting his own graduate degree. I find time to call him every few weeks, just to see if he’s dating anyone yet.When I met Sean, he was already dying. At twelve years old, Sean was diagnosed with idiopathic chronic recurrent pancreatitis. Two to three times a year, his pancreas starts digesting itself, sending him to the emergency room for weeks. Each attack progresses the disease, making the next attack more violent and more likely to kill. Idiopathic means there is no known cause, and therefore no cure.In 2020, an attack hospitalized Sean for a month. The pain was so bad that Sean broke his façade and begged a nurse to kill him. He told me a few months ago, as part of an elaborate joke.I still don’t think he’s funny.Recently, a doctor asked Sean to undergo genetic testing. He thought nothing of it. But about a month ago, the results showed two mutations in Sean’s DNA that decrease levels of the vitally important protein SPINK1. It turns out that SPINK1 is a preventative protein. It blocks another enzyme named trypsin, since too much trypsin can cause autodigestion of the pancreas. Suddenly, we had a cause. Idiopathic chronic recurrent pancreatitis became chronic recurrent pancreatitis.Given the cause, we found that researchers at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering — a research institute at Harvard University working on diagnostics and therapeutics — developed a preliminary drug just this February that provides artificial SPINK1 to the body. It prevents pancreatitis in experiments in mouse models, and is progressing towards human clinical trials. For the first time in fifteen years, Sean had a way forward.As a geneticist, I work on improving disease treatment by tailoring medicine to our genetics. Specifically, I study how genes regulate each other to cause disease. My roommate actually studies rare diseases like Sean’s. To then see genetics directly change Sean’s life felt almost … sacred. After all, scientists are motivated by real-world impact. We put up with low pay and years of extra schooling, all hoping our research will one day change lives. For it to happen for Sean … I think I’ve never felt quite that happy, in quite that way, before.For the record, I told Sean to get tested for years. He never listens to me.But now to my point. The Wyss Institute is backed by Harvard — which recently lost $3.2 billion dollars in federal research grants. These funding freezes could delay or cancel clinical trials that could save Sean’s life. And this situation isn’t unique — basic science is under threat across America. Congress is debating a budget that would cut $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which would shrink the country’s primary funding source for drug research by about 40%. We don’t know what we’ll lose with these cuts. A month ago, I had no idea Sean’s disease was genetic. Today, it’s a certainty. Science moves just as dramatically. Thirty-five years ago, we didn’t even know the sequenceof the human genome. But just this past May, scientists successfully treated a baby with a life-threatening genetic disorder, one similar to Sean’s, by changing a specific mutation in his genome. In another thirty-five years, it’s impossible to know what treatments will be available to us — or what might be lost without proper funding.Sean’s favorite joke is that if I don’t hurry up and get married, he’ll die before my wedding. He’s not wrong, even if he’s still not funny. People like Sean can’t wait for the next election cycle. Durham and Wake County alone have already lost a combined $754 million and around 3200 jobs. At Duke alone, projected future losses range between 500 and 750 million dollars — money which pays student salaries, keeps the lights on and maintains necessary lab equipment. Science is already suffering.Some costs can’t be measured in dollars. In response to the cuts, many graduate programs are cutting or stopping admissions. The Duke University School of Medicine, for example, will reduce its class size from 130 PhD students to a target size of 100. At the same time, alternate paths for funding like scientific fellowships have dried up. The next cycle of applicants faces steeper competition, with less money, for fewer positions and a less certain future. Meanwhile, the potential cuts have also limited our country’s ability to recruit talent from abroad. If we’re not careful, we stand to push away an entire generation of scientific talent.How can we help Sean, and everyone else who relies on science? We can remind ourselves, and those around us, that scientific research finds cures that transform lives. We can remind ourselves that science is fragile, and often, the first thing to go is research for rare diseases like idiopathic chronic recurrent pancreatitis.More importantly, we can remind our representatives. Call them today! Ask them if they’ve heard of idiopathic chronic recurrent pancreatitis, or other disorders that impact your loved ones. Tell them that science matters, that your loved ones matter, and that you support funding scientific research.I’ll end by saying that Duke is where I was trained. Professors like Owen Astrachan, Leslie Saper and Jayce Getz instilled (sometimes painfully) a foundation in math and computer science that I have relied on ever since. I am a more capable scientist today because my professors — and a small army of graduate teaching assistants — cared about my education. And while this piece is about science funding, I could not have written it without humanities professors and graduate students like Cathy Schuman and Claire Ravenscroft, who shaped me as a writer, thinker and person. Duke is also where I decided to study biology. I study genetics now in large part because Alexander Hartemink’s lectures made biology feel exciting and knowable, and inspired me to work with him. I can explain Sean’s genetics to you today because six years ago, a kind man thought it was important to keep teaching an undergrad even though he kept falling asleep in lab meetings.To these people and others, I am grateful. I am so lucky to be part of Duke’s rich history of math, science and the humanities. But these same professors face the most uncertain future for education and research in recent memory. Please help them keep that history alive for generations to come.Finally, Duke is where I met Sean. We fought over FIFA, ate McDonald’s at 3 a.m. and were happy. He was dying then, and luckily still is. He does not share easily, but I asked him to anyway, because it was important.Thanks, Sean. Get some new jokes, please.Albert Xue, Trinity '20, is a graduate student at UCLA Bioinformatics. "
Duke: Forget institutional neutrality and join Harvard’s lawsuit against Trump,Leo Goldberg,2025-06-29T16:11:00Z,Jun,29,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-forget-institutional-neutrality-20250629.html,"As difficult as it has been these last few months to keep track of each new crazy national headline that comes out, there has been one that still sticks with me, published in April by America’s finest news source, The Onion. That was the month that saw the widely publicized standoff between President Donald Trump and Harvard University, in which Trump cut funding to the institution for refusing to submit to his ideological demands, to which Harvard responded by promptly suing him. In response to the contentious matter, the Onion was quick to provide its characteristically shrewd and hard-hitting analysis, publishing an article flawlessly titled “Nation Can’t Believe It On Harvard’s Side.” Whoever told Trump it would be a good idea to challenge Harvard Law to a legal battle should definitely be fired, or immediately given a much-too-important top government position. Harvard’s decision to file a lawsuit for the $2.2 billion cut from their funding brought long-awaited gratification for many in higher education who wished to see at least one university stand up to Trump’s pathetic bullying. For months, a war on higher education has been waged by the president in an attempt to blackmail elite universities into moving to the right. Universities’ ability to enroll international students has been curtailed, student activists have been arrested and detained and billions in funding for America’s most rigorous and productive research institutions has been slashed.Universities, faced with these intimidation tactics, have largely acquiesced to Trump’s demands, implementing changes he wishes to see in higher education. Harvard’s lone brave stance has been admirable and righteous, as it has taken on the federal government essentially single-handedly. But other universities are finally beginning to join the fight.In the beginning of June, 24 research institutions announced their formal legal support of Harvard in its lawsuit against the president by filing an amicus curiae brief. This brief serves as a legal document that is submitted to a court by parties with an interest in the verdict of a specific case, but are not directly involved in the case themselves. In it, the schools asserted that academic research is a heavily intertwined field, and thus, harm to one is harm to all. In a released statement, they claim that “the federal funding terminations challenged in this lawsuit inflict grievous harm that extends well beyond Harvard University.” The list of universities supporting Harvard is as follows: American UniversityBoston UniversityBrown UniversityCalifornia Institute of TechnologyColorado State University.Dartmouth CollegeGeorgetown UniversityJohns Hopkins UniversityMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyMichigan State UniversityOregon State UniversityPrinceton UniversityRice UniversityRutgers UniversityStanford UniversityTufts UniversityUniversity of DelawareUniversity of DenverUniversity of Maryland, BaltimoreUniversity of Maryland, College ParkUniversity of OregonUniversity of PennsylvaniaUniversity of PittsburghYale UniversityAn impressive list, no doubt, yet with a glaring omission: our own university, Duke. Duke’s very identity as an institution lies significantly in its contribution to research, which is being actively undermined as it suffers alongside the worst of federal funding cuts. Hundreds of millions in grants through the National Institute of Health have been gutted, HIV/AIDS vaccine research led by Duke has been abruptly cut, and breast cancer research is in limbo. Furthermore, Duke’s impressive contribution to North Carolina’s boastworthy economy via the Research Triangle faces a substantial weakening from these financial severances. Our entire identity as a research institution and center for scientific innovation is being forcibly dismembered before our eyes. What is almost as bad is the disappointing way in which our administration has responded to these circumstances. The panacea offered by Duke leaders in response to this very flagrant and public assault on its status as a hub for research and intellectualism has been capitulation after capitulation. We've chosen to reply with voluntary buyouts for staff, hiring freezes, and a cost reduction of $350 million.If Duke does not want to directly challenge the administration on its cuts in court, that’s their prerogative. But they should at least join their peer institutions in the fight for academic freedom by declaring their formal support for Harvard’s legal battle. The fact that a research institute as prominent as Duke is missing from the aforementioned list is a scandal and a betrayal of the values for which we stand, from intellectual advancement to robust faculty-student relations. To add insult to injury, in response to the federal war on higher education, we have seen some — really pitiful, I must say — requests to adopt an institutional policy of silence, in order to make our groveling compliance even more apparent. Thus, we arrive at an issue which has been widely circulating around Duke in recent weeks, and must inevitably be addressed: that of institutional neutrality. On May 16, an opinion piece written by Duke Professors Bruce Caldwell and Timur Kuran was published in The Chronicle in which they advocated that Duke officially adopt a policy of “institutional neutrality,” a term they define in the article as “the commitment [of an institution] to avoid stances on divisive issues unrelated directly to its core mission.” I want to argue that such a suggestion is completely wrong on its face, and is simply bad policy, especially regarding the issues Duke currently faces. Institutional neutrality, contrary to what proponents claim, does not empower Duke to fulfill its ideals and goals. In actuality, it enables the University to deceitfully shirk its fundamental obligations to free inquiry and intellectualism. Take the example given by Caldwell and Kuran in their article — In April, President Price, along with over 100 university presidents, signed a statement condemning the federal government’s blatant overreach in higher education, a move touted by Caldwell and Kuran as an exemplary instance of institutional neutrality in practice serving the ideals of the university. What that letter was, though, was a clever surrender under the guise of action, which betrays our foundational values as an institution. By signing such a statement, Duke is able to claim they are fighting back in a way that is consistent with institutional neutrality while simultaneously giving Trump exactly what he wants: the promise to abstain from ideological positions. In other words, institutional neutrality is the apparatus by which Duke takes the easy bait that Trump has given them (condemning direct funding cuts on higher education) and uses it as a scapegoat to claim they are fighting back. Meanwhile, they are actually capitulating their ability to take positions on relevant social and political issues, coinciding with the true end goal of the Trump administration’s war on higher education. It’s a brilliant ruse, one has to admit. It doesn’t dislodge the fact that institutional neutrality, used in this way, undermines Duke’s very mission as a university. Duke’s motto is Eruditio et Religio, meaning knowledge and religion. Knowledge is not possible without critical thought and the support of free inquiry, both of which have been under an around-the-clock siege since January 20th, and which Duke now is willingly sacrificing by criticizing the means by which the federal government is limiting free inquiry (funding), as opposed to the idea of limitation itself. At a time like this, I think it is worth repeating a few of the most salient lines from Duke University’s Mission Statement to remind us why institutional neutrality fails our institutional values:“The mission of Duke University is to attend not only to [the students’] intellectual growth but also to their development as adults committed to high ethical standards and full participation as leaders in their communities;“to advance the frontiers of knowledge and contribute boldly to the international community of scholarship;“to promote an intellectual environment built on a commitment to free and open inquiry; to help those who suffer, cure disease, and promote health, through sophisticated medical research and thoughtful patient care” How is the intellectual growth of the student possible when the intellectual growth of the institution is being used as a bargaining chip for money? How are “high ethical standards and full participation as leaders in communities” possibly expected in students while the administration actively accepts the White House’s blackmail? How is a serious commitment to free and open inquiry possible while Duke concedes to a man who despises it? The answer to each of these questions is self-evidently the same: it is not. Institutional neutrality is a lazy and shameful cop-out, and is the opposite of what we need right now. Author and university professor Howard Zinn, who dedicated his life to using higher education against the abuse of power, sent a bold message when he titled one of his books, You Can’t Be Neutral on a Moving Train. That is the inconvenient truth we must face.Duke has the opportunity now to look back in 10 years, when the status of higher education should hopefully have equalized, and say proudly that it stood up for its students at a time when they were being actively undermined. That opportunity is regrettably being squandered each day we choose to exchange neutrality for inquiry. Our institution is giving up before the fight has even begun, while Harvard, a peer institution, is single handedly taking on the federal government of the United States to stand up not only for their students, but for their values. The time is long overdue for Duke to prove that it is willing to stand alongside its fellow institutions, students and its very mission as a university. Leo Goldberg is a Trinity first-year.

The problem with Duke’s Inclusive Excellence Working Group’s drafting principles,Sherman Criner,2025-06-16T09:00:00Z,Jun,16,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/problem-with-dukes-inclusive-excellence-20250616.html,"On June 9, Duke administrators unveiled the preliminary results of the Inclusive Excellence Working Group, announcing new “principles and recommended guidance” to align the University with both federal law and Duke’s institutional values. These values — “respect, trust, inclusion, discovery and excellence” — were reaffirmed as foundational to campus life. In their message, administrators reiterated Duke’s “longstanding goal” of “creating an inclusive community.” They emphasized that faculty must teach even “sensitive or controversial topics” in ways that are “consistent with our values” and that “encourage an inclusive environment.”At first glance, the language sounds admirable — perhaps even uncontroversial. Who could object to “respect” or “excellence”? Who wouldn’t want students to feel included, or for professors to teach with care and integrity? Yet, beneath this ostensibly neutral language lies a deeper concern: Duke’s institutional policies implicitly take sides on some of the most contested moral and political questions facing American society. In doing so, the University conflates partisanship with neutrality, presenting a particular vision of the human person as universal.This is not to suggest bad faith on the University’s part. The desire to foster a respectful and welcoming environment is entirely understandable and commendable. But if Duke is genuinely committed to fostering conversations on “sensitive or controversial topics,” it must reckon with the fact that its current policies appear to foreclose such discussions by embedding a specific set of assumptions into its official conduct standards. A university cannot simultaneously invite contentious debate and declare the terms of that debate settled.To those who worry that open discussion of such contentious topics might harm members of our University community, I ask only this: Did you arrive at that conclusion through a value-neutral, inclusive process? If not, then you, like the University, may be using the language of inclusion while quietly deciding, consciously or not, which views ought to be “included.” Of course, I am not arguing that a university should platform calls for violence or tolerate actual threats. But challenging an ideology — or even deeply held beliefs regarding one’s identity and purpose — is not the same as causing physical harm. A university is precisely the place where such challenges should be welcomed, not suppressed.To understand how Duke’s principles are slanted, one must look to the definitions Duke provides for its core values. On the University’s “Values & Culture” webpage, you’ll find an unassuming list of the five “shared values,” but no definitions or elaborations beyond vague references to the inclusion of “people of diverse backgrounds.” If you, like me, are wondering which people and which backgrounds ought to be included, this webpage offers no support. Since Duke’s Values & Culture page offers only vague platitudes, the clearest window into what the University means by “inclusion” comes from the Office for Institutional Equity (the OIE) — the body responsible for enforcing the University’s values on equity through its anti-discrimination and harassment policies. More specifically, the OIE’s policy on “Discrimination and Harassment Based on All Protected Characteristics” offers the most concrete account of what Duke considers an “inclusive community.” This policy outlines a set of demographic traits — race, religion, national origin — but also includes “gender,” “gender identity” and “gender expression” as protected characteristics.The OIE specifies that gender identity is defined as “one’s innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither.” Gender expression is said to be “the external appearance of one’s gender identity … which may or may not conform to socially defined behaviors and characteristics typically associated with being either masculine or feminine.” And, as one might expect, gender is described as “a socially constructed set of expectations … generally based on an individual’s sex assigned at birth.”While many of my peers likely support these definitions, they cannot reasonably be said to foster an ideologically inclusive environment or fair discussion on “sensitive or controversial topics.” Why not? That’s because meaningful dialogue on difficult topics demands room for a genuine diversity of reasonable viewpoints — even when those viewpoints sharply conflict. And, the reality is that the definitions provided by the OIE are not merely debated in academic or philosophical circles; they are directly rejected by more than 60% of the American public.Still unsure how Duke’s policy reflects a particular ideological stance? Consider a contrasting example: Hillsdale College, an openly Christian institution. Its harassment policy does not define “gender” at all, let alone distinguish between “gender identity” and “gender expression.” It refers only to the two “naturally ordered” sexes. Is this policy ideologically biased? Certainly. But then, why isn’t Duke’s? By defining gender as “socially constructed” and potentially different from biological sex, Duke’s policy directly contradicts the view held by millions of Americans that gender is determined by sex assigned at birth. In doing so, Duke transforms a contested social theory into moral orthodoxy, all under the banner of “inclusion.” The concern is that enshrining this philosophical position into harassment policy makes even respectful disagreement vulnerable to administrative sanction. At minimum, this poses a serious risk to the University’s commitment to pluralism. Still, the question remains: what kind of conduct would actually trigger such enforcement under the University’s harassment policy? If Duke were to adopt a narrowly tailored standard — one that clearly distinguishes ideological disagreement from personal abuse — this concern would be significantly less troubling.The relevant standard, per the OIE, is as follows:“Unwelcome protected status-based conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from Duke’s programs or activities (i.e., creates a hostile environment).”This standard, particularly its references to “subjective offensiveness” and whether a student feels “limit[ed]” in their ability to benefit from a program, is worryingly vague. Though the policy claims to distinguish harassment from merely “unpleasant” behavior and recognizes that isolated incidents typically do not create a hostile environment, it immediately undercuts that clarity. For example, the policy's section on antisemitism and Islamophobia includes “slurs” as harassment, but fails to define what makes a word a slur, leaving administrators to determine “objective” offensiveness based on subjective judgments.This vagueness, coupled with the expansive and ideologically contested definitions of gender, creates a policy framework that is both imprecise and susceptible to becoming a vehicle for ideological conformity. Consider a hypothetical but plausible scenario: a Muslim professor at the Divinity School teaches their students, repeatedly throughout a semester, that biological differences between the sexes require there to be only two genders. A transgender student in their class feels this creates a hostile learning environment that limits their educational experience by advocating for their “erasure from society.” Under the current harassment policy’s broad and subjective language, this professor could face disciplinary consequences.This brings us to the second prong of the problem: the contradiction between the stated commitment to open, even controversial dialogue and the implicit boundaries enforced by current policy. Faculty and students were told, by the Inclusive Excellence Working Group, to approach sensitive topics in a way that is “consistent with our values.” Yet, those values appear to be interpreted through a framework that precludes dissent on the core moral and political questions seemingly implied by the Group’s statement. Even if you set aside the less-than-neutral definitions in OIE’s policies, one must only glance back a few years to see the dangers of vague enforcement criteria in action.In October 2023, the University removed the widely used pro-Palestinian protest slogan “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” from the East Campus bridge. The administration cited concerns that the phrase is “associated with an erasure of people and antisemitism” and “understood by many in our community … as a call for violence.” While the slogan is undoubtedly polarizing, it does not have a universally accepted meaning. For many, it expresses a nonviolent aspiration for Palestinian liberation. Its removal was not prompted by an objective act of harassment or incitement, but by a subjective interpretation of a widely supported political message. That is precisely the danger of vague policy language, especially when compounded by a lack of clearly articulated, constraining values. In the absence of such a principled enforcement framework, administrators are left to suppress speech not based solely on the objective character of what is said, but on how one student feels it “limits” their experience.If the University genuinely believes that dissent from its moral frameworks constitutes harassment, it should explicitly state this belief and enforce it consistently. This would mean student groups that platform speakers with traditional views of gender should face the same consequences as those involved in sexual misconduct. However, if Duke won't take such measures, it must acknowledge that its current approach is, at the very least, deeply unhelpful and ought to be clarified.But, lest one believe I am presenting a false dichotomy, there is a third possibility. Duke may be content to let the threat of enforcement quell speech on its own. Faculty and students may not be punished, but many might still avoid controversial topics altogether, wary of crossing unseen lines. Though speculative, if Duke is genuinely “inclusive,” why do many professors and students feel compelled to “self-censor” views that dissent from the status quo?Ultimately, ambiguity in enforcement benefits no one. When the application of policy appears to depend on political expediency or ideological conformity, the University’s professed commitments to “free inquiry” and an “inclusive” environment become hollow slogans. Worse, when faculty and students self-censor to avoid the possibility of being accused of creating a “hostile environment,” the University loses the very diversity of thought it claims to cherish.None of this is a call for disruption or disrespect. It is a call for administrative honesty and coherence. If disagreement with specific identity frameworks is tantamount to harassment, Duke should say so plainly — and enforce their speech codes accordingly. But if these topics remain, as many believe, legitimate subjects for academic inquiry and civil debate, then Duke must revise its policies to reflect that conviction with clarity and fairness.Fortunately, Duke has opened a public comment form, available until June 18. If you value intellectual honesty, this is your chance to demand coherent policies that match the University's stated commitments.Sherman Criner is a Trinity junior. "
Chronicle Leadership: We stand with student journalists and Columbia Spectator,Chronicle Leadership,2025-06-09T16:00:00Z,Jun,9,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/statement-in-support-of-student-press-columbia-spectator-20250609.html,"On May 7 the New York Police Department (NYPD) and Columbia University’s Public Safety team infringed upon the fundamental right to freedom of the press, restricting reporters’ ability to cover a protest unfolding on Columbia’s campus. The reporters impacted included ones from Columbia Daily Spectator, an independent student-run publication like The Chronicle.Spectator released a statement alleging repeated instances of NYPD and Public Safety officers using force against student reporters and obstructing their ability to fully cover the protest.The Spectator detailed the following violations:A Spectator photographer was unintentionally caught in a crowd rush and was restrained and effectively choked by a Public Safety officer despite holding up a press pass.A senior NYPD officer threatened to revoke a Spectator videographer’s city-issued press card after they asked an NYPD officer if three Spectator reporters on the other side of the barricade could enter, even though NYPD does not have the power to seize or revoke a press card. NYPD and Public Safety officers explicitly blocked student press from entering areas where the protest was taking place.Less than a day after the protest, Spectator reported that Barnard College and Columbia had placed student journalists under interim suspension, citing that they had participated in the Butler Library takeover.Each reporter had published bylines before the suspensions and had identified themselves as members of the press to Public Safety officers during the protest.While these suspensions were eventually lifted, Columbia and Barnard wrote in their emails to the student journalists that the institutions reserve the right to take future actions against them for the same demonstration. Although Spectator said officers did not appear to specifically target student journalists but rather “responded indiscriminately toward anyone in their path,” such actions set a dangerous precedent for the freedom of student press. Press — the only profession explicitly named under the First Amendment — has an obligation to seek and report the truth. University administrators must protect and must not infringe upon the student press, even as their reporters uncover truths that run contrary to the administration’s goals. The attacks at Columbia were not the only instance threatening the student press.On March 27, Rümeysa Öztürk, a doctoral student at Tufts University, was detained by plainclothes immigration officers and had her visa revoked. According to Ozturk’s friends and colleagues, her only known activism was co-authoring an op-ed in Tufts' student newspaper — The Tufts Daily. Öztürk has since been released from detention, but her case remains a chilling reminder of the risks the student press may face.Student news organizations cannot afford to cave to fear and self-censorship; doing so undermines their credibility, weakens their ability to hold their universities accountable and sets a dangerous precedent for journalistic independence.Censorship of student journalism does not always take overt forms; it can also manifest as institutional opacity and the withholding of public records. In November 2024, the Kentucky Kernel sued the University of Kentucky, after they refused to release documents related to an alleged on-campus sexual assault. The Kernel ultimately won, but cases like these underscores how impeding investigative reporting can limit the ability of the press to strive for accountability. At a time of uncertainty and federal change, we must be clear: The Chronicle condemns all attacks on student press freedom and all violations of the First Amendment.The Chronicle joins Spectator in demanding the following — as outlined by Spectator editorial staff and alumni: for Columbia to publicly acknowledge the harm caused by Public Safety officers and the NYPD at the Butler Library protest.for Columbia and Barnard to issue apologies to every student suspended for a protest they did not participate in.for Columbia’s president Claire Shipman to sit for an interview with the Spectator.The Chronicle is releasing this statement alongside The Daily Tar Heel, Daily Trojan, The Daily Emerald, The Purdue Exponent and The Daily Pennsylvanian.In a separate statement, which can be found here, The Exponent explained Purdue's refusal to continue to distribute their paper on campus."

Is there such a thing as institutional neutrality?,Kenneth Surin,2025-05-30T10:00:00Z,May,30,Letters To The Editor,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/such-a-thing-as-institutional-neutrality-20250530.html,"I joined the Duke faculty in 1987 before retiring in 2018. I have been following the debates over institutional neutrality closely, in particular the editorial by Professors Timur Kuran and Bruce Caldwell. Calls for institutional neutrality tend to hinge on the issue of academic freedom and the teaching mission of the university, which at one level is important in its own right. No one wants a university with a broken-backed teaching mission because factionalism and ideological rivalries hinder critical thinking and discussion.At the same time, there is the proverbial elephant in the room. Universities — and Duke is no exception — have endowments massively invested in industries that degrade the environment, as well as in the defense sector, which, carte blanche, provides weapons to countries with abominable records on human rights. It is not only their endowment investments — universities also receive substantial grants for research in aerospace, biotechnology, robotics weaponry, stealth technologies and tools used to immobilize or police political protesters.At this practical level, there is no such thing as institutional “neutrality.” On the contrary, universities are up to their necks in the mire. Entire departments — especially those in STEM — would have to close down or be reduced in size and research output without the funding that makes a mockery of so-called institutional “neutrality”.Finally, U.S. academic exchanges with universities in countries that systematically harm their populations also challenge claims of neutrality. For example, one of the focal points of Columbia’s anti-Israel protests has been against an exchange program which allows IDF soldiers to pursue their education at Columbia. How plausible, therefore, is any claim that Columbia is or can be “institutionally neutral”?Kenneth Surin is a Professor Emeritus of Literature."
Duke should commit to institutional neutrality,"Timur Kuran, Bruce Caldwell",2025-05-16T11:00:00Z,May,16,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-should-commit-to-institutional-neutrality-20250516.html,"In its April 11 report, Provost Alec Gallimore’s Committee on Academic Freedom and Responsibility, Free Expression, and Engagement offered strong support for the principles of academic freedom. Appreciating the care with which the Committee investigated this issue and explained the importance of free speech to Duke’s core mission, we also applaud its endorsement of free speech as essential to both education and research. Noting that the issue of whether Duke should commit to institutional neutrality — the commitment to avoid stances on divisive issues unrelated directly to its core mission — was not among the matters it was charged to examine, the Committee offered a brief discussion of the subject because of its importance, articulating arguments on both sides of the issue. Members of the Duke Faculty for Institutional Neutrality and Free Speech, a group of 140 faculty from across the campus, signed a petition urging the University administration to commit the University to institutional neutrality and affirm the centrality of free speech to healthy education and productive research.The proposal consists of two simple sentences:When a contested social issue arises that does not directly concern the academic mission of our university, Duke’s leadership will not issue a position statement on that issue.On rare occasions when a public issue arises that directly affects the mission of the University, our leaders may issue statements that articulate the significance of that issue to our campus community.Institutional neutrality is a necessary complement to defending free speech at Duke. It would keep the University impartial on divisive issues, allowing faculty and students to engage in honest, open, and respectful debates without fear of going against Duke itself. Whenever the University endorses specific positions, it risks alienating parts of the community, stifling conversations it should be encouraging, and constraining the pursuit of truth. Institutional neutrality fosters a collaborative and inclusive intellectual environment. This is why we urge Duke to embrace institutional neutrality, safeguarding open dialogue for all.In national debates on whether universities should be institutionally neutral, the opponents of institutional neutrality often invoke shared community values and commitments as a justification for taking an institutional position on a particular issue. They presume agreement where it may not exist. The lack of opposition to an institutional stance may reflect fear of dissenting rather than genuine consensus. Imagine that Duke University takes an official position on a politicized issue and conveys that position through either its central administration or one of its units, say, a school, department, or program. Faculty and students with reservations about the position will think twice before speaking out against it, much less even to question it. The chilling effect on campus discourse should be obvious.According to The Chronicle’s April 2024 survey of faculty, support for institutional neutrality far exceeds the 140 faculty who have signed the petition of Duke Faculty for Institutional Neutrality and Free Speech. Almost two-thirds of the respondents to The Chronicle survey then supported the adoption of a statement of institutional neutrality, with over 40 percent supporting it strongly. The Provost’s Committee on Academic Freedom conducted its own survey of the campus community on the issue. It, too, found that a majority supports institutional neutrality. It is, then, dismaying commentary on our campus climate that only 140 faculty members felt comfortable attaching their names to the petition when far more supported institutional neutrality in an anonymous poll. If our private conversations with dozens of non-signing faculty from a wide variety of disciplines are any indication, the most common reason lies in fear of retaliation. Many faculty sense that they would pay a price for giving the impression, rightly or wrongly, that they dissent from political positions held by intolerant campus activists situated in either academic units or the administration. If Duke adopts institutional neutrality, it would be in good company. Since May 2024, many universities and colleges, including seven of our peers among the 15 ""Ivy Plus"" universities, have committed themselves to institutional neutrality. Indeed, Duke is behind the curve in offering a principled public endorsement of this key component of the institutional framework needed for protecting free speech, which is the reason why Provost Gallimore established his Committee on Free Speech.It might seem that Duke already follows a policy of institutional neutrality. President Vincent Price’s decision to sign the “Call for Constructive Engagement” protesting the federal government’s intrusion into higher education is an example of responding to initiatives directly relevant to university life, but also of resisting pressures to impose thought control on academia and politicizing it. We commend our president for joining the “Call,” which accords with the principle of institutional neutrality, as stated above. By adopting our proposed policy, Duke would signal its commitment to principles that it is already following at the highest levels in many areas. Yet, in recent years, Duke has not practiced institutional neutrality consistently, nor at present is it being practiced consistently by its schools and departments. University websites have contained, and still contain, statements of political solidarity and political pronouncements that are not directly related to the core mission of higher education. Such statements and practices violate the principle of institutional neutrality. A commitment to institutional neutrality would require them to be removed.A public statement of Duke’s commitment to institutional neutrality is especially important in the current environment that campuses face nationwide. It is a necessary step towards restoring public confidence in universities as places of learning. It will also bolster Duke’s defenses against potential external demands — from campus activists, outside organizations and constituencies, and the government — to take sides in political controversies that lie outside of the domain of a healthy university. For all these reasons, we hope that our administration will either formally adopt a policy of institutional neutrality or explain to the Duke community why, in its view, that would not be in the University’s best interest.Bruce Caldwell is a research professor of economics.Timur Kuran is a Gorter Family Distinguished Professor of Islamic Studies, and a professor of economics and political science."

The end,Audrey Wang,2025-05-01T10:00:00Z,May,1,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-wang-the-end-20250501.html,"I was speaking to a friend — another graduating senior — who mentioned he was selling his mini fridge, and I got snippy with him.I also have a mini fridge, but I have made no plans to sell it. I don’t know how I’m going to ship my things back to California, nor which things I’ll leave for my juniors. Despite receiving an early job offer, I have made no effort to search for an apartment. I have procrastinated on emailing all the people I want to have one last coffee with because I am convinced that it will somehow be the last time I see them. All this is out of character for someone who prides herself on planning ahead. I conveniently ended the conversation with my graduating friend by developing a mild-to-moderate migraine, caused by the feeling that despite my insistence that I have no tender feelings toward Duke except through the people I love here, that I am sick and utterly tired of all the nonsense of bull---- assignments, that I desire nothing more than to be as far away from this wannabe-Yale/Princeton/insert Ivy here-university-with-a-lowercase-u, I have gotten attached right at the end. Sometimes the end takes you by surprise, but sometimes you can see it slouching slowly toward you. My time with The Chronicle was the latter. I am not particularly sentimental about my editorship, despite being immensely grateful for the people I met through it. Its end was — to put it bluntly — agonizing and lonely. I was and still am proud of the work we did in Vol. 119, but I confess that I did not love it. Somewhere in the middle, I lost the taste and talent I once had for reporting. Instead of being a joy, editing became a part-time job, and The Chronicle was simply the institution keeping me in the office. By the end of my junior year, I felt that the newspaper that I had made the heart of three years had extracted as much as it wanted out of me and was now intent on putting me to the side. I wish I had ended my editorship differently, but I could not. The fact that I fell out of love with it was nobody’s fault but mine. I did not write a farewell column, not because I didn’t want to, but because I couldn’t muster up the energy to fake loving The Chronicle. I took up a position in Vol. 120, not because I was particularly excited about writing for the newspaper, but because I unwillingly felt it was my responsibility. How glad I am that I felt this way. If I didn’t, I would not have discovered how much I enjoyed writing again by making the role of data editor my own. I only regret that my Nixon profile was not longer and that we didn’t delve deeper into our polling data. If I had the time, I would have written more. I am particularly thankful that I re-learned how to love The Chronicle through its people. I am proud — though I dislike expressing it because affection still embarrasses me — of Vol. 120, which has achieved more than I could have hoped for despite being thrown into the deep end so early. How excited I am to see what the first-years who stumbled into 301 Flowers two years ago do next, even if their calling me grandma makes me feel way older than I am (Can a woman not have back problems at age 21?). I enjoy talking about The Chronicle over lunch now. When one speaks about ends, they are inevitably reminded of the true end, which we can choose to believe is emptiness or otherwise. My father suddenly died a month before my editorship began, and since then, I have unwillingly associated The Chronicle with the mourning I delayed for a year to manage the newspaper. What a sick joke it felt like at the time. When he first held me in his arms, he told my mother that he already hated his son-in-law. Now he will never walk me down the aisle. He will not hold any of my children. The man I loved most in the world, who would print out my articles to mail them to my grandparents, never read anything I edited during my volume. When you look at your father’s body, you only have one choice before you, and it’s the only one that will matter for the rest of your life. You can choose to believe that this is it — that the remains before you will rot away, yours and everyone else’s, and that will be the end of all ends. Or, you can choose to believe you can hope to see him again. You can choose to believe that he was made with a purpose and that he would never be left alone. You can choose to believe in your pain. You can choose to believe that this is not the end of things. And so, I conclude with the things that I believe in. I believe I made a positive impact on Duke. I believe that student journalism is the future of journalism, in offices across the country but especially in 301 Flowers. I believe that my time at The Chronicle was not wasted. I believe in its future volumes. I believe that I am made with and for love. I believe God is merciful, and thus I believe my father is not abandoned. I believe that there is true finality for few matters, and death is not one of them.And so, I leave this university, not with regret but with joy, for nothing has ended for me. Please take care of Vol. 121.Audrey Wang is a Trinity senior and served as editor-in-chief for The Chronicle's 119th volume and data editor for The Chronicle's 120th volume. She would like to thank all members of Vol. 119, who brought The Chronicle to life even when she couldn’t. On that note, she would especially like to thank Jazper Lu, her former managing editor, for sticking by her side. She would like to thank the staff of Vol. 120, especially Abby Spiller, Michael Austin and Zoe Kolenovsky, for how they have made The Chronicle their own, and for the better.

Stop banning reporters from covering campus protests,Robin Kirk,2025-04-26T10:00:00Z,Apr,26,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/stop-banning-reporters-from-covering-campus-protests-20250426.html,"Via a friend and neighbor who is a journalist, I learned that on the morning of April 17, Duke denied her permission to cover a campus National Day of Action event to support higher education. The protest was organized by students, staff and faculty.The protest focused on the White House’s attacks on universities across the country. Organizers called on Duke to speak out forcefully in support of education, free speech and our community members who are not American citizens. The protest was a national effort sponsored by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), hardly a fringe or radical group.I understand that these are deeply perilous times. But barring external media from covering the protest is exactly the wrong move. Duke is a private university and can control who comes on campus. In the case of approved protests by members of our community, a generous application of that policy should be the standard. At a time when universities are rethinking how to make a robust case to the American people about their vital role in bettering society, Duke should allow reporters to cover future demonstrations.Attacks by the Trump administration on universities like Harvard and Northwestern are shocking evidence that institutions of higher education are in an existential battle against an authoritarian regime doing everything in and out of its power to crush free speech and independent thought. In my view, they are targeting universities as part of a coordinated campaign to eliminate institutions capable of mounting substantive critique and positive alternatives. Harvard University’s decision to stand up for its principles against threats is a model for how Duke should articulate a parallel, powerful vision for the future. Harvard, also a private university, allowed external media outlets to cover on-campus protests.Harvard is living its values, as I hope Duke will choose to do in the future. In this world of cell phones and whirring news helicopters, barring the media is a fiction that ends up communicating fear. Instead of standing up for our beliefs by barring the press, we look afraid and exclusionary. We need to consistently model how to engage with peaceful, nonviolent protest, in this case, organized by our students and colleagues, approved by administrators, and coordinated with dozens of other colleges and universities. When we fail to do that, we are assisting the aims of the antidemocratic forces who aspire to eliminate institutions of higher learning like Duke.Make no mistake. That is the Trump administration’s goal. Allegations of antisemitism are the excuses they are using not to reform, but to destroy. Curtis Yarvin is a self-proclaimed “neoreactionary,” hard-right blogger embraced by many in the White House and MAGA-aligned think tanks. Yarvin contends that Duke and other U.S. institutions of higher learning are part of “The Cathedral,” a sclerotic, out-of-touch, elitist hierarchy. In its place, Yarvin wants a monarch—or, just as useful, a billionaire freed from electoral politics and the law. In that world, universities have no place.When we fail to live our values, we risk becoming the Cathedral Yarvin and his MAGA co-conspirators so determinedly caricature. We also send the wrong message to the communities whose support we desperately need in this fraught moment.What I believe we should communicate is not exclusion but openness. Not separation but commitment to our community and democratic values. Duke is rightly celebrating the 1968 “Silent Vigil” as part of the Centennial of the University’s founding. Still the largest protest in the university’s history, the Silent Vigil pressed for collective bargaining rights for AFSCME Local 77, the labor union for nonacademic employees and an end to campus racial discrimination. Protest should be seen as emblematic of our core values, which include education and engagement with society, not something to hide away. Recently, Dr. Jim Yong Kim visited Duke to talk about his work with Duke alum Dr. Paul Farmer. He spoke movingly about how Duke helped shape Farmer, who entered the university determined to use a medical degree to become rich and left profoundly changed.Kim quoted Immanuel Kant’s challenge to embrace optimism as a moral duty in these difficult times. I would rephrase that to urge Duke to consider courage as a moral duty as well, to not only phrase our values but live them in our decisions.

On charging the grounder,Michael Austin,2025-04-23T10:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-austin-charging-grounder-20250423.html,"You might not be in the mood for a sports metaphor. I’m often not in the mood either. But for some reason, when reflecting on my time in 301 Flowers, I think of a baseball cliché.My unexceptional baseball career spanned from my rookie tee-ball season at age six to my retirement at age 12. I was pretty mediocre at the sport — in part, because of my fear of the ball. When playing infield, I’d stand worrying about whether the ball would be hit too hard in my direction.I was apprehensive when first told by my coach — or perhaps my parents — to “charge the grounder.” Why would I do that? It meant throwing myself closer to what felt like danger, granting myself less time to react and meeting the ball at a higher velocity. I didn’t realize it at the time, but charging the grounder is how you end up with the baseball safely in your glove. By running towards the ball, you decide exactly how and when you’re going to catch it, and then you have the momentum to finish the play. You meet the ball on your, rather than its, terms.The advice wasn’t enough to salvage my baseball career. But a decade later, I think it was just the lesson I needed to meet the challenges of leading a college newspaper.My transition to The Chronicle’s leadership happened rather quickly. It was February 2024, and I had only dabbled in news writing. My first story was about crosswalks in Durham, my latest piece had been about how fuzzy sea otters can slow erosion, and the remainder of my clips fell comfortably within that spectrum of sidewalks to sea creatures.Still, Volume 119’s leadership — and I consider this one of the greatest gifts that one can give — believed in me. They recommended that I help run the next volume, and weeks later, our editor-in-chief Abby, our news editor Zoe and I took the reins of the news department.This meant leading coverage during a tumultuous time in the world, with tensions boiling over on college campuses across the country. To me, the task of thoroughly, fairly and accurately covering Duke felt like a grounder rocketed in our direction.That’s when I realized that my teammates were some of the bravest people I’d ever met. Abby and Zoe launched themselves right in the direction of that grounder. For the 365 days after Weston Estate performed “Daisies” on Abele Quad, Abby and Zoe never stopped pouring themselves into the volume. I have not met anyone more unflinchingly and wholeheartedly committed to something than those two.It seemed like Zoe was always reading the news, writing articles, pitching stories, planning coverage and training others, and it resulted in a truly exceptional body of work. She taught me what it meant to never stop working towards excellence.Meanwhile, I watched Abby approach every critical choice and difficult decision with tact and poise, creating an office culture and news output that I was proud to be a part of. She showed me what it looked like to be persistently decisive and uplifting as a leader.They set the bar so damn high. And I must admit, I couldn’t quite keep up with them. But in merely trying, I figured out how to really charge a grounder.That meant picking up stories that made me nervous. It meant waking up early to interview leaders, experts or activists before class, and then fact checking stories in painstaking detail late into the night. It meant spending 12 months of free time brainstorming headlines, advising reporters or coding new formats for our content.By choosing to do these things — proactively, willingly and on my terms — I learned to approach journalism not with intimidation, but with excitement.I also realized that the hardest grounders led to the most meaningful outcomes. When confronted with difficult moments in our community, pushing for the most accurate and considerate framing possible made me feel deeply connected to Duke.When I first became a Blue Devil, I had romantic expectations. I thought that every day would challenge me and that every person I encountered would be obsessively curious or desperate to change the world. In my first two years of college, I experienced many such moments and had many of these encounters. But I learned to temper my expectations; I couldn’t demand this to be the norm. But The Chronicle is not normal. A group of 18- to 22-year-olds spending their nights and weekends documenting our University, city and nation in a creative, empathetic and discerning way is far from normal.So this year, every time I walked into 301 Flowers and inevitably found our reporters, columnists and photographers chiseling away at their Pacemaker-award winning masterpieces, the norm did not apply. Every day challenged me and each person inspired me. The Chronicle made Duke exactly what I had hoped for.I’ll likely never have to play infield again. (Abby and my predecessor Jazper, with whom I took a basketball class this fall, know I much prefer to hoop.) But as The Chronicle has prepared me to run headfirst at even the most daunting opportunities, I will now always charge the grounder.Michael Austin is a Trinity junior and served as managing editor of The Chronicle’s 120th volume. He would like to thank Abby Spiller and Zoe Kolenovsky for their friendship and support through the adventure of the past year, Audrey Wang and Jazper Lu for their mentorship and humor, and Ana Despa and Lucas Lin for their enthusiasm to lead the future of the paper.He would also like to thank his friend Conor for supporting The Chronicle despite its shade of blue; and his mom, dad and sisters for believing in him always."
I’m still on that tightrope,Tyler Walley,2025-04-23T10:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-walley-still-on-tightrope-20250423.html,"“Mirrorball” is the sixth track on Taylor Swift’s eighth album, “Folklore.” I first listened to the song in June 2023. I initially connected to it thanks to its amazing production (courtesy of longtime Swift producer Jack Antonoff), but gradually got more and more pulled to its lyrics.The feeling of being “on that tightrope” has stuck with me for the whole of my time at Duke. Freshman year was particularly rough: I got broken up with, landed in a less-than-ideal friend group situation and didn’t do much outside of my classes. It was a hard time, not unlike the hard times that many people experience in their first year of college.At the start of my sophomore year, I made a commitment to myself — partly at my mom’s request — that I would get involved in more things on campus. In August, I decided to attend an info session for The Chronicle. I had read some of the “Duke in the NFL” blogs and wanted to give the sports department a try.Two years later, I traveled to Evanston, Ill., to cover the Duke versus Northwestern football game — the first thing I had written about for The Chronicle. In a back-and-forth contest that went to double-overtime, the Blue Devils prevailed. As I walked to the press room and prepared to interview head coach Manny Diaz, my hands were still trembling from how thrilling that experience had been. That whole game, which saw Duke nearly lose at multiple turns, was the epitome of Swift’s lyric: “I’m still a believer, but I don’t know why.”I wouldn’t say I experienced a game as wild as that one again during my time at The Chronicle, although the women’s basketball victory against Notre Dame comes close. However, one thing that every blog, column or gamer provided me with was an outlet. Whenever I wanted to put off my homework, I would write a blog or think of a column. Whenever I was bored, I would do the same. Even my trivia team this semester is almost entirely composed of Chronicle sportswriters. And when a close friendship unraveled, I immersed myself in the ACC women’s basketball tournament and looked toward my friends in the Chronicle.The Chronicle made me feel seen in so many different ways. Every compliment I got about my ideas, every time I was shouted out in our weekly sports meetings — I always felt listened to. Nothing else I did or experienced at Duke was as unconditionally supportive as the halls of 301 Flowers. If you had told me the sports department of my student newspaper would have done all of that for me freshman year, I don’t think I would’ve believed it. Looking back now, I just wish I had joined it sooner.* * *“Sion James inbounds the ball, and Duke is on to the national championship!”“Tyrese Proctor makes two clutch free throws!”“It’s a double-elimination tournament … Duke will be back tomorrow!”Those are a sample of the dreams that I’ve had following Duke men’s basketball’s loss to Houston a few weeks ago. I’m far from the only fan who took that loss tough, but hopeful and absurd visions of a win really made me wonder whether being a Duke fan was actually worth it.In September 2023, I had a similar experience with Duke football’s game against Notre Dame. The Blue Devils had it — and then it was all gone, with Sam Hartman driving a dagger through Duke’s heart with a 4th-and-16 conversion.That was the first time I cried after a Duke sporting loss. And yes, the second time was the loss to Houston. Over the last few days, I’ve asked myself repeatedly, “why do I care so much?” and “is it worth the pain?” To answer the first question, there’s a lot of reasons — the shared experience of Duke students and my general enjoyment of sports, to name a few. But I can’t help but think that my time in The Chronicle was a part of it. The analytics columns I wrote about players like Cooper Flagg and Khaman Maluach grew my appreciation for this iteration of the Blue Devils, making it all the more heartbreaking for me when they lost.This is the exact tradeoff — I cared more, so it hurt more. As I leave Duke, I know that the losses will no longer hurt that much. But, leaving Duke also comes at the cost of losing The Chronicle, the safety valve that has kept me grounded over the last three years.I’m still a believer, but I don’t know why — especially when it comes to being on that tightrope of Duke sports fandom. But as an outlet, The Chronicle brought me out of the slumps I experienced at Duke, and made the pain of the losses worth it.Tyler Walley is a Trinity senior and served as associate editor for the sports department in The Chronicle's 119th and 120th volumes. He would like to thank Dom Fenoglio and Rachael Kaplan for getting him into the analytics side of sportswriting; Ranjan Jindal for always being available to workshop his ideas; Andrew Long for drawing him into The Chronicle and for their wonderful conversations over lunch; Martin Heintzelman for always giving him a laugh in 301 Flowers; Caleb Dudley for keeping his brain active with trivia and Abby DiSalvo for her ability to chat about anything, from football analytics to philosophy on the L train. Last but not least, he would like to thank Sophie Levenson for their years of friendship."
For the love of the game,Ranjan Jindal,2025-04-23T10:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-jindal-for-love-of-game-20250423.html,"I sat on press row in San Antonio for Duke’s contest against Houston after we spent the better part of a month preparing for the what if. Well into the second half, I had a draft of our instant victory newsletter on Mailchimp ready to send along with a special Instagram graphic. The thoughts of our next day — inevitably filled with InDesign and production planning — filled my mind. I edited the gamer too, of course. And then J’Wan Roberts made two free throws. Cooper Flagg missed. Tyrese Proctor’s desperation heave went begging. The next hour, and really the next 24, was a blur. Due to deep March Madness runs from both Duke men’s and women’s basketball, I never fully grasped the end of Vol. 120. It felt so distant, even as the weeks drew near. But the grim realization I had waking up Sunday morning was that this year was coming to a close. Because I can’t sleep on planes, the 5 a.m. Monday morning flight back from San Antonio gave me time to reflect. Everyone played to their strengths on that Duke basketball team to create a beautiful product — and in the same way, what I am most proud of this volume is how many brilliant minds contributed to our coverage. It is fully a team effort. My mind drifted back to last February when I was elected. I am so grateful that the sports department put their faith in me from the beginning, and this position allowed me to give back to two things that are fundamental in forming my identity: The Chronicle and sports. Basketball has been my life-long best friend and first love. The hoop in my driveway turned into an obsession, and it was a year-round venture since elementary school. I used my jump shot to make friends when I was too shy to initiate conversation. It also gave me some of my hardest moments in life, when I faced the most mental adversity and my first true battles with self-doubt.In that sense, covering sports has given me a new outlook on how I watch games. My fellow writers know I am notorious for emphasizing — probably overemphasizing — the role of the mind in sports. Writing about people my age who have the pressure of the world on their shoulders at times has made me more empathetic to college athletes. Despite its challenges, nothing is more special than chronicling people who truly love what they do. Sports are a beautiful reminder that passion leads to greatness. The unifying bond of sports became clear as we interviewed fans in Charlotte at the ACC Tournament, and after I wrote a feature on a Durham barbershop branded off the Duke-North Carolina rivalry. There’s not a lot anymore that naturally brings together people from across generations and socioeconomic classes, but sports does. It provides a sense of belonging and an escape. It’s a conversation starter and a magnet for passionate debate. It has paved the way for a grandchild of Cuban refugees to lead Duke’s football program and has given a young boy whose family fled South Sudan an irreplaceable opportunity.Collaborating in a department that gets to write about such a storied athletic department has been an absolute dream. I sat courtside in Madison Square Garden, traveled to Texas twice for the NCAA Tournament and watched the WNBA’s best compete in Cameron Indoor Stadium. Running into one of my high school basketball coaches who I hadn’t seen in years in the Alamodome elevator was the perfect symbol for my sports journey. I came into my leadership position with countless ideas, and while they didn’t all come to fruition, I’m so proud of our department’s growth. There is room for improvement, but we are starting to look more like Duke and have attracted people from all corners of campus. From our 50-plus person department to the ad staffers and Pitch content curators, everyone was so valuable and brought their unique perspective for the better. Nothing makes me more happy than seeing passionate writers express joy in their work or those who see their own ideas come to fruition. I love hitting the publish button and sending them congratulatory texts. My favorite part of our weekly sports meetings is shouting out each other’s articles. I wanted to bring joy to this position, and I hope I was at least a friendly face for everyone in our department. This has been the best year of my life, and I can’t wait to contribute to the next volume. Acknowledgements: Ranjan Jindal is a Trinity junior and the sports editor of The Chronicle’s 120th volume.

Walking on,Andrew Long,2025-04-23T10:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-long-walking-on-20250423.html,"I remember that November 2019 evening in Northwest England vividly: 60 thousand fans rising to their feet, hoisting their kids onto their shoulders and raising their scarves, once wrapped tightly to keep out the frigid coastal wind, into the air. They caught their collective breath and as a familiar tune blared over the loudspeakers, began to sing in unison.After a minute or so, they reached the chorus, a four-word phrase and the song’s title that has become synonymous with Liverpool as both a soccer (football) club and city: “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” It is emblazoned on the team crest and the song is played before every home game — an eternal reminder that, even at one’s lowest, he is never hopeless. Direction and solidarity will come if he can just, as the song goes, “walk on.” Like I imagine was true for many of my peers, my life leading into college was so focused on getting to a place like Duke that I spent little time figuring out what I wanted from it when I got here. I didn’t know where I wanted to grow, how I wanted to spend my time or the kinds of people I wanted to surround myself with. I felt untethered — insecure in my community and lacking a sense of purpose. I needed to “walk on,” but I lacked the conviction to start. The Chronicle, at one point a complete unknown but now a dear friend, was what pulled me onward. The Chronicle was a surprise I am as bewildered by as I am grateful for, and one that I don’t want to wash away as a simple instance of good fortune. Even if I feel more settled now than I did four years ago, it took me feeling stranded at sea to get here. I’ve spent a sizable chunk of the last year trying to remind myself of that, especially as I stare down more unknowns post-grad. It’s not about asking for an oar, but opening your sails and trusting the wind.That wind has brought me more good surprises than I could have ever hoped, all of which have shaped me in their own way.I always loved to write, but The Chronicle taught me how to tell stories. It gave me the space and the resources — including trips across the country and courtside seats — to pursue projects I wanted, and provided the platform to share them. I met and got the chance to learn from some of the most brilliant people I’ll ever meet. My editors gave me confidence in my voice as a writer and reporter, helped me learn from my mistakes and encouraged me to be ambitious in my journalism but kind in my relationships. With the example they set, I was able to help younger writers find purpose and community in journalism the same way I had, something I take an immense sense of pride in.I was pushed to my physical and mental limits, forcing me to reckon with what I value most. My year as sports editor was simultaneously the most difficult and most fulfilling of my life, one that rewarded my at-times self-sacrificial persistence with the deepest sense of purpose I’ve ever had.I discovered then centered my life around The Chronicle’s dingy third-floor office, a place that today feels just as close to home as Idaho does. It was my escape and my safe-haven, my dining hall and my library — the crucial “third place” so many of us lack.And lastly, but not exhaustively, I found my best friends. They held me up at my lowest, celebrated me at my highest and were there for every mundane moment in between, all more than I ever expected anyone could. They made my time at Duke worthwhile. As I leave Durham and embark on whatever journey lies ahead, I know that I will encounter the familiar questions about who I am, what I want to do and what kind of community I value again. I offer one piece of advice to myself and anyone else in a similar predicament.Be comfortable not knowing the answers and don’t expect you know where you’ll find them. It took embracing a complete unknown for me to figure out The Chronicle was my place, journalism was my purpose and the people both introduced me to were my community. I’m the happiest and most fulfilled I’ve ever been because I did.I’d also suggest remembering the final verse of “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” “Though your dreams be tossed and blown,” it goes, “Walk on.”So walk on.Andrew Long is a Trinity senior who served as sports editor for The Chronicle’s 119th volume and recruitment/social chair for The Chronicle’s 120th volume. He would like to thank all those who surprised him the last four years — you’re the reason he’s sure he’ll never walk alone."
This is not goodbye,Rachael Kaplan,2025-04-23T10:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-kaplan-this-is-not-goodbye-20250423.html,"I have spent the last two weeks of my final semester interviewing seniors about basketball. The “last class of Coach K.” I listened to them speak about watching Caleb Love’s shot from the front row of Caesar's Superdome, about sunrises in Krzyzewskiville, about singing the alma mater in the Alamodome after losing to Houston. I saw their eyes light up talking about sitting on the court in Cameron Indoor Stadium with their friends and their faces fall when they got to the end of the game in their retelling. Most of them didn’t enter college as Duke fans, or even necessarily sports fans. Now they are all united with a common cause (and common enemy). Aside from just being classmates, they are now Duke basketball fans, and big ones. They will be for the rest of their lives. Each has spent incredible amounts of time, money and energy in that fandom, be it tenting, flights to New Orleans, 21 hours each way on a bus to San Antonio. They all shared how winning that national championship, and being there to see it, would have been “the coolest moment,” as Joey Stanley put it. They talked about crying after the loss, fighting through crowds of North Carolina or Houston fans chirping them leaving the stadium. Losses are tough. I grew up a New England sports fan in Baltimore. Enemy territory. When I was in third grade, my friend’s father, Andy, and I made a bet. The Patriots and the Ravens were playing in the AFC Championship — if Baltimore won, I would have to wear a Ravens jersey to school. If New England won, Andy would have to wear a Patriots jersey to work. I was arguing with classmates from then on. I still get texts about ugly Bruins or Duke losses. Junior year of college, I decided that I wanted to work in sports. It was already so much of my life — making it my career sounded like a dream come true. I got asked “why?” a lot, by interviewers and professors and every adult who wanted to know my future plans. I told them about my extended family up in Massachusetts, how I could always talk to my uncles about the Bruins, my grandfather about the Red Sox, my grandmother about the Patriots. Growing up, sports kept me connected to family that was physically so far away. It provided a link, but I wasn’t surrounded by fellow fans — I watched all of my classmates revel in victories and mourn losses together. I never had that. It was one of the things that drew me to Duke, the passion for basketball that students shared. I wanted to dive headfirst into the Duke basketball experience. Stand in section 17. Be part of the sea of blue I had seen on TV. Months before the basketball season started my freshman year, I wrote my first article for The Chronicle. I had joined because of a Facebook recruiting post captioned: “Want to sit courtside in Cameron?” My dad sent it to me, and obviously my answer was yes, so I attended my first meeting. In the spring, I applied to be a blue zone editor. I didn’t think through that decision very much — I enjoyed writing the blogs and I enjoyed being in The Chronicle. It seemed like the logical next step. I began spending more time in 301 Flowers, yapping about who was entering the transfer portal, the upcoming NFL Draft, NHL playoffs, baseball and lacrosse and everything we could think of. For the first time, I was surrounded by people who were as passionate about sports as I was. Watching a Duke basketball game from press row with an open laptop and a ticking clock is a unique feeling. The screams from the Crazies behind you become white noise. Somehow, I think it’s the place I can focus best. Covering this program as a beat, the investment becomes more complex. There are hours of writing and editing, researching, interviewing. Long travel days. When the season ends, and the team loses for the final time, it all stops. In the blink of an eye, you go from planning for a championship to tracking closing doors and publishing goodbyes. I have shared every Duke athletics triumph and tragedy with the people in the sports hall. They helped make sports not just something I would obsess over in my childhood home, but something to bond over. As a freshman, I remember the looks on Jake Piazza and Max Rego’s faces when they realized they were going to go cover a Final Four. I remember sitting with Andrew Long as juniors when we realized that we weren’t. I’ve witnessed field stormings and a 4th-and-16 that will live in infamy. I can confidently say that Duke would not mean nearly as much to me if I didn’t have the sports staff alongside me the entire way. Keep playing trivia in the office, watching a different game on each monitor. Live and die by the results of each game, even the early ones. Celebrate and mourn with your Chronicle community — it’ll always be there. Andy, you still owe me a day in a Patriots jersey.Rachael Kaplan is a Trinity senior and served as sports managing editor for The Chronicle’s 119th volume. She’d like to thank every masthead that came before her for teaching her how to be a good journalist. She congratulates the entire staff for Vol. 120, because the work that they have done is amazing and deserves recognition. She wishes the best of luck to the incoming masthead and the underclassmen on sports staff, though she knows they won’t need it. She would like to thank Chrissy, not only for what she does but who she is. For those who don’t know, Chrissy is the backbone of this paper, and a truly amazing person. Lastly, she thanks Andrew. It was a wild four years. Who would have thought, at that first outdoor meeting in 2021, that we would end up here. "
A thousand words,Abigail Bromberger,2025-04-23T10:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-bromberger-thousand-words-20250423.html,"Perhaps it is fitting that the first words I am writing for The Chronicle are also my last.Over the past four years, I have spent hours in The Chronicle office, arriving as early as 5:00 a.m. and leaving as late as 3:00 a.m. I have trekked up the never-ending staircase even when I thought my legs were going to fall out from under me, missed parties for last-minute Chronicle assignments and collected countless press credentials in my backpack. The Chronicle has been the most defining feature of my time at Duke, but I have never published a single word.Instead, I have published hundreds of photos, which are helpfully consolidated in a pinned note on my phone titled, “Stories w my photos.” And I have taken tens of thousands of them, most of which are unpublished, probably lost forever to the black hole of our publishing software. I have always considered myself a writer. I started my first journal at eight, recording the highs and lows of my childhood in a pink and green diary. I kept the key to the diary in my sock drawer, safely protected from prying eyes. As I got older, I continued recording my life in notebooks and Google docs, choosing my language with care. I began envisioning a career as a writer, dreaming about becoming the next Joan Didion or Mary Oliver. Big shoes to fill, admittedly.So learning how to see the world through a 70-200mm Canon lens initially required a little bit of patience. When I decided to join The Chronicle in August of my freshman year, I couldn’t make the first news meeting, so I went to a photo meeting instead. Afterwards, I texted my mom: “I have to take photos for the chronicle for a Tuesday deadline. but omg the meeting was so cool. I’m so happy I went.”I did my first story, learning how to check out equipment from the photo closet, how to edit photos effectively, and how to identify myself as a Chronicle journalist at events. Then I did my second, where I learned that people stare angrily at you if you randomly point a camera at them (valid), and then my third, during which I realized that maybe I wanted to do a fourth.Somewhere along the way, my shoulders unclenched and I began breathing more easily. I put down my proverbial pen and I settled into the rhythm of the photo department. Even though I was still confusing ISO and aperture, I felt comfortable. I texted my mom, again: “I just kind of feel like I’m in the right place even though I don’t know what I’m doing.” And I realized that, by letting go of the instinct to write down everything I was seeing, I was making room for noticing, for reflection, for the most truthful and accurate reporting that I could possibly do. By allowing myself to use only my eyes, to quiet my brain, and to observe, I discovered the corners of Duke that often go undiscovered.I found poignance in the way that Duke Athletics staff cleared the way for Kara Lawson to walk onto the court. I noticed that the area behind the Chapel is where a lot of people go to cry. I focused on how the sun reflects off of stony Few Quad at 6:00 a.m. I became transfixed by the way that the yard signs during election season lost their battles to the wind and bent over, urging people to “OTE.”I watched as students’ faces twisted in anger and sadness during vigils and memorials. I felt the significance of what lies inside the Allen building, felt the decisions made behind those doors swirl around me in unrelenting ways. I saw wringing hands at academic council meetings, hands that held worry about the future of the university and of its students. I captured the despair in researchers’ eyes as they talked about funding cuts, and I recorded professors’ joyful smiles as our reporters wrote about grants they were awarded and breakthroughs they achieved.I noticed the color of the air when I listened to acapella performances in the Divinity School, and, during bench burnings, the color of the sparks above our heads and of the burnt grass below our feet. I became certain that tenters’ dedication is the most important thing in the world. I fell in love with the desperation of the cherry blossoms, the way that they are always trying to reach their peak and then I fell in love with the way that, on one glorious spring day, they do.And, I think, I wouldn’t have been able to notice any of those things if I hadn’t really looked at them. And, I think, I wouldn’t have really looked at any of those things without The Chronicle.Now, somehow, I am getting ready to leave. I am packing up the same set of plastic drawers that I bought freshman year, back when I didn’t know who I was going to be friends with or how I would fill my afternoons or what I would study. And I am writing my professors thank you notes, and I am filling out surveys for every entity I have ever interacted with here, and I am trying to figure out how I say goodbye to a place like this. Should I go visit my freshman dorm? Should I lay in the gardens for hours or should I go inside every building on campus that I haven’t yet? Should I try new restaurants or revisit my favorites one last time? Should I be intentional about the last time I walk out of The Chronicle office, or should I let it be organic?In the end, it won’t matter. What matters is that I learned to really, truly see this place, and to love it for all that it is, and to stop writing for just long enough to capture it all.Abigail Bromberger is a senior and former photo editor of The Chronicle. She would like to thank Becca Schneid and Winnie Lu for welcoming her into the department and showing her the ropes. Their mentorship and warmth was invaluable. She would also like to thank Vol. 118 masthead, specifically Kathryn, Milla and Katie, for their perpetual kindness and staggering capabilities. She also would like to thank Abby, Zoe and Ranjan for teaching her what it means to be a meaningful part of a newspaper and for giving audience engagement as much love as it deserves. Importantly, she would like to thank all the current staff photographers who put their faith in the department, as well as Karen and Morgan who have led the department with grace and made me proud.She reserves her most enthusiastic thanks for Alyssa Ting, who was with her during that first (poorly attended) photo meeting, and who has been by her side ever since. She is grateful for Alyssa’s patience and friendship and for her ability to keep her sane during some stressful times and sagas with broken equipment. Finally, she would like to thank all her non-Chronicle friends for making her Duke experience precious and singular, and for listening to her rant about the importance of a free press on a weekly basis. She is certain that her friends all know how much they mean to her, but she finds it hard to pass up an opportunity to remind them."

Ten things I didn’t learn at Duke,Nathan Luzum,2025-04-23T10:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-luzum-ten-things-didnt-learn-20250423.html,"A wonderful time of year is upon us when the 21- and 22-year-olds of The Chronicle deign to endow us with their reflections on Duke and what makes a worthy life (I say this as someone who did the same thing a few years ago). At the ripe age of 26, however, I realize there’s a lot I haven’t learned since getting to Duke’s campus in 2016.1. When to show up to an event starting at 9 p.m.I really wish I could figure this one out. The first time I was invited to an evening event, I showed up five minutes early and the organizer was utterly appalled — never had I felt so ashamed of my punctuality.Since then, I’ve just resigned myself to getting to places early and awkwardly loitering outside until other people arrive. America’s higher education system could really do better at teaching this — two Duke degrees later, and I’m still none the wiser.2. How to slow down and appreciate simple moments before they’re goneI’ve gotten to a point in my Duke journey where every campus happening evokes a Chronicle memory. Every bench burning reminds me of the time I interviewed Dean Sue Wasiolek after she stood atop a bench to prevent students from illegally burning it (and my feature stories with Lexi Kadis on the tradition). Any campus art piece prompts me to remember the time Carter Forinash and I covered a random Keohane painting that caused “unease” for some students and culminated in The Chronicle co-hosting a panel on good art. But all of these random memories, now cherished and formative, seemed to be quotidian at the time. Maybe as I accumulate more of them, I’ll become attuned to finding the beauty in such moments.3. Where to find a seat in West Union at 1 p.m.It’s a tale as old as time, grabbing your lunch and circling interminably around the first floor in a vain effort to find an open table. Then there’s the obligatory trip to the second floor accompanied by awkward eye contact with students studying, all just to make the descent of shame and circle the first floor again. At this point, your options are dwindling — assuming it’s not a nice day, you need to pick between the brutalism of the Bryan Center or making a new friend by sitting one diagonal seat away at a long table. Bonus points if they have noise-cancelling headphones to muffle the sound of you snarfing down your food. 4. How to make everyone happyAfter writing my first column as a medical student about the anatomy lab, I received an email from an administrator explaining that some faculty members thought the descriptions were too vivid and requested that the column be significantly modified. Such emails were familiar to me from working on the upper masthead of The Chronicle as an undergraduate. In these cases, sometimes there is an error or lapse in judgment, and the proper course is to correct the mistake and apologize. Oftentimes, though, others simply find the unvarnished truth to be inconvenient to a narrative they’d like to portray. The role of journalism is to remove this varnish, albeit with discretion and thoughtfulness.5. How to support a basketball team that wins a National ChampionshipA nonnegligible reason that I returned to Duke for medical school was to finally see the team win a National Championship after the Zion year and COVID left me feeling defeated. Well, we all know how that turned out. Even though the season endings didn’t always live up to the hype, there was no shortage of fond memories.I’ve resigned myself to believing that I’m a bad luck charm for the team and will not be the least bit surprised when Duke wins the National Championship next year after I leave campus. I won’t be bitter at all.6. How to survive entirely on free stuff from Duke eventsIn undergrad, some of the other Chronicle editors and I thought it would make for a great story to have a couple reporters go a whole week eating only free food on campus and then write about it (to be clear, the writers signed up for this assignment). Unfortunately they both got sick a couple days into the week — totally unrelated to the food, as best we could tell — and the story never got written. But I always thought it wouldn’t be that far-fetched to live off the land, rolling up to random speaker events or academic symposia and gorging yourself.7. How to gracefully ride the bus when you have food poisoningNever did I realize how many speed bumps existed between 300 Swift and the West Campus bus stop until I had food poisoning in 2018. Every lurch of the bus caused my stomach to cry out in pain. I’ll spare everyone further details, but suffice it to say that it’s not worth dragging yourself to a neuroscience discussion section when you’re teetering on the precipice of violent illness at every moment. 8. When to stop editingChronicle reporters and editors really care about getting things right — despite what some of our beloved social media comments might imply, staffers really do care about every story. The art is in figuring out how to titrate this care to favor excellence over perfectionism. When editing stories, I often did “just another pass” to eliminate AP style mistakes or repeatedly fact-checked convoluted stories. When doing this for many articles, diligence bordered on inefficiency.Learning when to say enough is enough and have faith in your own process for completing a task — acknowledging the small chance of a mistake — is an undervalued skill.9. How to know if a squirrel is in the trash can before you throw something awayTo be clear, I’m not blaming the squirrels here — I’m sure students throw away great leftovers. But too often I’ve thrown something into a trash can, causing a panicked squirrel to leap in toward my head. I started to listen for faint rustling after my first such encounter, though this wasn’t foolproof. Now I just toss my trash toward the can from afar like a soldier throwing a grenade in a war zone, hoping that I’m outside of the squirrel’s jumping radius. 10. How to say goodbye to something you love so dearlyIt’s a wonderful thing to know a place well. Over the past nine years, I’ve come to know Duke and The Chronicle better than anywhere else. The office of 301 Flowers provided a more enduring community for me than anywhere else. It was a privilege to help recreate this welcoming space for others as an upperclassman, and now more indirectly, through my work on the Board of Directors.The Chronicle provides a lens to realize how much I’ve grown over the past decade. At the end of the day, I guess it’s wonderful to have loved a place so much that saying goodbye becomes so hard.Nathan Luzum is a fourth-year medical student and member of the Duke Student Publishing Company Board of Directors who served as managing editor of Vol. 115, among other roles, and just needs to move along already. He would like to thank the hundreds of staffers who have helped make The Chronicle a welcoming community over the past decade. "
The end of a four-year identity crisis,Alyssa Ting,2025-04-23T10:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-ting-four-year-identity-crisis-20250423.html,"I’ve always considered myself to be an extrovert — I love meeting people, thrive in social environments and my friends will definitely agree when I say that I enthusiastically extend my friendship to anything that breathes. Yet, there is one group of people that I’m always a bit hesitant to meet: Brazilians.Before you report me to the Duke Oﬃce for Institutional Equity, there’s something you should know: I’m Brazilian myself. I was born and raised in São Paulo to Brazilian-born parents — but that’s where the claim to my Brazilian identity ends. My jet black eyes and hair betray the fact that I’m Chinese (Shanghainese, to be exact) and the gringo accent on my Portuguese signals my American upbringing and education (I attended an American School in Brazil and speak English at home).And while I know in my heart that I’m Brazilian — though I admittedly don’t watch soccer — when I meet other Brazilians, I fail to feel as Brazilian as they are. Suddenly, I’m hyper aware of my gringo accent and largely resort to speaking in English, as if hiding my sotaque will prevent them from unmasking me as a fake Brazilian.I felt like an outsider to my own culture; and so, I searched for community elsewhere. I found myself at the bottom of the endless, winding stairs to 301 Flowers.My cousin, the photo editor of the time, had convinced me to join the department. She lured me in with the possibility of shooting a basketball game and having the luxury of skipping the grueling walk-up line. A complete novice to photography, it was with her that I learned to put a camera together and take my first photos.Two short years later, I accepted the photo editor position at The Chronicle with no hesitation; I was thrilled by the opportunity. I had so many ideas and plans that I could hardly wait for the second the clock hit midnight after LDOC — Volume 119’s first breath. But as the summer passed by and I prepared to welcome in a whole new group of photographers to our department, I felt some doubt creep in.I was still figuring things out. I could barely articulate what aperture was or why we kept it as low as possible, and I was still losing a battle to the overly yellow Cameron lighting. I didn’t even know what to look for in a good camera or lens, or any of the fancy tools photographers used. Would the incoming photographers be able to sniff out my lack of experience? Did they have more photo experience than me? Was I qualified to lead, or was I still an outsider, peering in?As The Chronicle newcomers rolled in, though, all those fears gradually went away. After all, they were just people, right? I could deal with people. Rather than obsess over what I did or didn’t know about photography and what niche photo techniques I had or hadn’t heard about, I poured my heart and soul into the people.I made it my personal mission to truly get to know each and every student who stopped by the photo department — whether they showed up consistently to meetings or came by once every few weeks. I memorized faces, names, majors, hometowns and just about any information shared with me. I cherished each and every primary assignment I took, grateful for the opportunity to small talk with my shadowing photographers.It was exhausting, but in the best way possible. And as I spoke at our end-of-year banquet, I couldn’t help but tear up as I looked towards the full table of young photographers I had shared the past year with. My time as photo editor was not defined by the photos I took or the photography skills I had taught; it was defined by the people I had met and the moments we’d shared. Those were my people: I had found the belonging I’d craved.* * *For a lot of my time at Duke, I felt like I was simultaneously chasing my Brazilian identity and running away from it. It was paradoxical: I’d take a capoeira class in the hopes it’d make me more Brazilian, yet refuse to speak Portuguese to my friends in BRASA.But I know now that belonging to a group is not just about sharing a common skill, ability or interest. Learning new photography techniques did not help me feel like I belonged to The Chronicle’s photo department. Creating deep relationships with those in it did. So while I listen to Brazilian podcasts every morning to improve my Portuguese, I’ve come to terms with the fact that I may never get rid of my gringo accent. And I’ll probably never be a great soccer player or listen to funk. But that’s okay — from the countless friendships I’ve made with those back home and the Brazilian community here at Duke, I know I belong. Obrigada por tudo.Alyssa Ting is a Trinity senior and served as photo editor for The Chronicle’s 119th volume. She would like to thank all of The Chronicle’s staﬀ, lowermast and uppermast for the admirable work they put in every day. She’d especially like to thank her cousin Bella for inspiring her to join The Chronicle and welcoming her into the department, as well as Becca and Winnie for serving as an excellent example of Photo leadership. She is so incredibly proud of Karen and Morgan for the amazing work they’ve done in leading the photo department for Vol. 120, and can’t wait for Amy and Anabel to do great things with it next year. To Abigail, she expresses all her love and gratitude — for being her rock from their first day at The Chronicle all the way to the end, and tolerating her endless texting along the way. Last but not least, she’d like to shout out her suitemates, family and friends for supporting her along the way and making her feel so capable and loved."
Journalism is in crisis. We should look to student newspapers for answers.,Zoe Kolenovsky,2025-04-23T10:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-kolenovsky-journalism-in-crisis-20250423.html,"At many points throughout the past year, I imagined this column differently.I planned to use this space to recount the countless incredible experiences I collected and lessons I learned in my year at the helm of Volume 120’s news department. It was a role I never expected to assume; I joined the paper in the fall of my sophomore year, walking hesitantly into the Flowers Building for the first time with the intention of writing a handful of articles on environmental issues. Instead, I found myself less than a year later as a 19-year-old with access to the “publish” button, staring down the barrel of a whirlwind election season, a once-in-a-century institutional milestone and a rapidly evolving higher education landscape.But I’m not leaving the paper just yet. I have one final year at Duke ahead of me, and while I’m definitely looking forward to spending fewer 3 a.m. nights in the office, I know The Chronicle will remain a recurring character in my life — a permanent fixture in my Google Calendar, but also my heart. So, I’m saving most of my sentimental reminiscing for next year’s farewell column, the “real goodbye” already looming overhead. Today, there are more important things to say.Journalism is in crisis.It’s a bold claim. It’s also one you’ve probably heard many times before, which can make it feel tired, but I believe it is nonetheless true.The problem as I see it boils down primarily to two things: failing to reach readers and losing their trust.Readership is dwindling for newspapers across the board, partly because the media landscape has exploded in recent years. With the rise of the internet and social networking platforms, information is flowing faster and farther than ever before, virtually erasing the geographic and temporal distances that previously separated communities on opposite sides of the globe. While that increased connection can be a good thing — in theory, a globalized world can be a more informed and empathetic one — it also means news now comes at all hours of the day from a near-infinite amount of sources, ranging from legacy print and TV outlets to independent podcasters and anonymous voices on social media.With so many options to choose from, credible sources of information can get lost in the noise.So journalists are grappling with heightened competition in this new cutthroat attention economy, and it looks like we’re losing. Print and digital newspaper circulation dropped 8% and 10%, respectively, from 2021 to 2022. Advertising revenue dropped 5%.What’s worse, it seems many of our departing readers have no desire to come back.Trust in the media is currently at a historic low. We came in dead last on a list of democratic institutions ranked in order of public trust, with only 31% of respondents to a Gallup poll published last October expressing a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust and confidence in the media. In fact, for the third year in a row, more people — 36% — reported no trust at all.Journalism isn’t fulfilling its purpose when our audience doesn’t trust us; why bother writing if no one’s going to read it? It’s clear the industry needs to change.Luckily, student journalists are paving the way forward.Student newspapers draw their strength from being deeply embedded in their communities. At a time when the professional media scene is consolidating into a handful of large outlets that focus primarily on national headlines while local news dries up — at a rate of 2.5 shutdowns per week in 2023 — our papers represent one of the last places where reporters live and work among the people and places they write about.That means we understand the problems our readers grapple with on a day-to-day basis and are able to answer questions they actually want answered. We are plugged into all corners of campus, keeping tabs on shifting student sentiments and administrative changes to break news in real time, while also investigating the long and complicated history of our evolving institution. And we understand the importance of spotlighting the joys of being a Blue Devil too, from recognizing student organizing and entrepreneurial achievements to profiling campus characters who have become core to the Duke identity.Local reporting isn’t all we do. Student journalists consistently operate on the front lines of national developing stories — perhaps more today than ever before, and occasionally putting themselves at personal risk in the process. Duke student reporters broke multiple national news items this year, and with a growing spotlight on the changing higher education landscape, our role is only becoming more important.But it’s our commitment to taking a community lens to these national issues that sets The Chronicle’s reporting apart, and in my view, that’s an approach the larger field could learn a thing or two from. The time and resources required to invest in covering local communities thoroughly and responsibly is worth it — not just because they deserve reliable news, but because the trust fostered when readers feel not just informed but listened to will help sustain our dying industry.Of course, The Chronicle still has to maintain a policy of avoiding conflicts of interest to ensure our more direct personal relationships do not color the news we publish. And we don’t have everything figured out just yet. We don’t have the capacity to report out every single story relevant to our campus, and we’re still working on strengthening our relationships with sources and readers. But more broadly, being involved in and connected to our local community is a boon to our reporting, not a detriment. And we’re always striving to improve. We began covering Durham City Council and Duke Graduate and Professional Student Government regularly for the first time this year, broadening our definition of who gets included in our community and enhancing our role as institutional watchdogs. We launched a new audience engagement team to help diversify our content and package our reporting in exciting and digestible ways. And with a staff of reporters, photographers and editors from all academic disciplines, we’re perfectly primed to continue innovating and making our content more interesting, wide-reaching and useful to the people we’re writing for.Student newspapers are hotbeds of creativity, and journalism writ large needs the kind of willingness to experiment paired with a passion for service that I see every day at The Chronicle.This year, our staff has adopted an unofficial motto: We were there. For every milestone in Duke’s history, our reporters have been there — even before the University itself.So today, when the journalism industry needs as much support as it can get, our community needs access to timely news, and our readers want confirmation that they can trust the work we do, we will still be here.One of my esteemed predecessors on the paper’s leadership team — Matthew Griffin, Trinity ‘22 and Vol. 116 editor-in-chief — coined an axiom that has served as my guiding star throughout the past year in my roles as reporter, editor and teacher. I am recycling his words again today to reflect my vision for the future of this industry that is in danger but remains so essential to our collective well-being, as well as this organization that has done so much for me and countless others in the Duke community.At The Chronicle, we will always find new ways to let in the light.Zoe Kolenovsky is a Trinity junior and served as news editor of The Chronicle’s 120th volume. She is deeply indebted to Abby Spiller, Michael Austin, Ranjan Jindal, Dom Fenoglio, Sophie Levenson, Alice Qin, Karen Xu, Morgan Chu, Zev van Zanten and all the other immensely talented reporters, photographers and editors who have contributed over the past year to making the paper not only a widely recognized paragon of excellence, but also a vibrant and caring community she has come to call home.She would like to thank Audrey Wang and Jazper Lu for showing her what it means to be a student journalist, and Chrissy Murray for being a constant pillar of support for generations of devoted chroniclers. She looks forward to a new chapter of coverage overseen by Ana Despa, Lucas Lin and Claire Cranford.And last, but far from least, she is especially grateful to this year’s news department for placing its faith in her leadership, being patient with her perfectionism and trusting her vision for coverage that is accurate, balanced, compassionate, diverse, evolving and — above all — fair."
Your voice is a currency — so use it thoughtfully,Alice Qin,2025-04-23T10:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-qin-speech-currency-new-playbook-20250423.html,"The opinion section can be considered to be somewhat of an oddball in The Chronicle. News breaks timely stories and in-depth features for on-campus and local/national issues. Sports does similar things, along with gamers and player reviews, for the grand gauntlet of Duke athletics. Recess releases a variety of entertaining commentary on arts and culture. Photo enshrines all these things in the form of a visual archive. Presumably, our job is then to amplify the opinions within the Duke community about things that are important to its members. Sounds straightforward enough. But what is an “opinion,” and what counts as things that are “important”?Usually, the best reporters are those who can be as impartial as possible. This requires removing entirely one’s biases from an article, despite potentially living and breathing in the same spaces as that article’s subjects. However, the opinion section couldn’t be any more different. The best columnists are those who immerse themselves fully within their pieces, where their perspectives are so definitively subjective that no one else could have produced those words.In my section, people don’t break stories. For better or for worse, people themselves — and their opinions — are the story. And what a year it has been to have an opinion on things. From the very first to the very last week of my time as opinion editor, new subjects emerged every day that caught the attention of our campus. Duke's collaboration with Lululemon. College rankings from the Wall Street Journal. Greek life. Legislation affecting transgenderathletes. Protests. Research cuts and the standing of higher education. Financial aid. The meaning of institutional neutrality and ideological diversity. Worker conditions. The visa revocations of international students and what they entail. On top of all this, it’s become harder and riskier to express opinions at all. Particularly in recent months, my tenure was dominated by a constant, unrelenting state of urgency, creating what felt like a swirling storm of uncertainty leaking into every corner of life. I had to wrestle with how the opinion section is meant to capture — or not — the nebulous concept of discourse on campus. I’ve also noticed one way that this sense of urgency has influenced the way some writers approach their pieces. Now, more than ever, I hear sentiments that emphasize the timeliness of the article’s topic, sometimes overriding considerations around its substance. “This is an important issue, so I just want this to go out as soon as possible,” I remember hearing something along those lines. Or, “I don’t need it to be perfect, it just needs to be good enough.”Those conversations often led to a set of existential questions: What does “good enough” mean? Is it the same for op-eds compared to other types of speech? What’s the point of an op-ed, anyway? Are its goals different from speech in general?* * *Before this year, I largely understood free speech as a right or value, whose practice is key to anchoring our democratic institutions. But in a hyper-congested information environment, I’ve increasingly come to understand it as something more akin to a currency.Like how the value per unit of currency can be diluted if we print too much money, an overflowing amount of speech arguably dilutes the value of each unit of speech. Take the example of the nationwide “Hands Off!” protests in early April. Organizers stated that more than 1,000 rallies of different sizes took place and more than 500,000 people participated. Yet, as someone who consumes a lot of political news, I barely saw any discussion of this event on my timelines. The costs associated with organizing such an event were undoubtedly substantial — but for the public, it may have just one protest out of countless videos of others. Paradoxically, it seems like desensitization to both threats to speech and speech itself has risen in tandem with urgency.A similar dynamic can manifest for op-eds. In the context of campus life, reading an op-ed in the student newspaper may no longer be the primary way in which students engage with community discourse. (For better and for worse, the opinion section of The Chronicle will have to compete with apps like Fizz and Sidechat.) Now, it can be just another body of text out of a steady stream of other content.Ultimately, this suggests that the traditional playbook of encouraging speech for the sake of speech, as fast and as much as possible, may no longer be good enough — at least in making tangible change.Speech is, at its core, a medium of exchange between people. Somewhere along the way, I fear our systems have lost sight of that. The bombardment of information we receive every day, despite its timeliness, has not made the exchange in the marketplace of ideas more liquid. Instead, the media space is missing an injection of thoughtful forms of communication that provide constructive and authentic engagement. Op-eds have the potential to do just this: They can be long enough to articulate a rounded argument, accessible enough for wide audiences to understand, yet condensed enough to remain grounded in contemporary conditions. So, to any op-ed writers who feel the urge to say something fast — to just simply get their opinion out there as quickly as possible because you feel a sense of urgency breathing down your neck — I offer a reason to pause.Your voice is a valuable currency. You have to use it intentionally for the investment to pay off. No one is asking for perfection, but I hope you choose your words wisely — purely for the goal of telling your story in the best and most compelling way that you can.Alice Qin is a Trinity senior and served as opinion editor for The Chronicle’s 120th volume.

There’s no doubt in her mind that Shambhavi will take the section to new heights.She expresses an incredibly special thank you to John Bussian, a Duke alum who has served as The Chronicle’s pro bono counsel for over 30 years. No words can suitably describe how grateful she was for all the late calls and article reviews. His work, exclusively representing news media interests nationally in First Amendment matters, has deeply inspired her. Finally, she would like to congratulate Abby Spiller, Michael Austin, Zoe Kolenovsky, Ranjan Jindal, Zev van Zanten, Karen Xu and Morgan Chu for a truly special and award-winning volume. "
You can just do things,Jules Kourelakos,2025-04-23T10:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-kourelakos-you-can-do-things-20250423.html,"As I’m getting ready to graduate, I’m thinking about art and why we talk about it.I’ve had a strange run at Recess, albeit one I’m mostly proud to look back on. I showed up to a Chronicle info session as a shy first-year and picked the department where, I hoped, people would be least likely to actually read my writing. (This turned out to be hilariously untrue: good Lord, look at the number of sketchy publications I’ve been quoted in, most of which inexplicably introduce me as a man. Seriously, though, we do numbers. I’m proud of us.) I served as a staff writer for two years, wrote a lot of things I loved, met a lot of people I loved and became deeply burned out for mostly (but not entirely) unrelated reasons. I was on the verge of quitting when I was asked last-minute to serve as Recess editor for fall 2023, on account of a scheduling conflict involving the original co-appointees to the role. In my four years at The Chronicle, I’m the only editor I know of who never intended to be one. Running Recess with no journalism leadership experience or managing editor to help out reminded me of Mao: the children’s card game where you start out with no clue how to play, and have to figure out the unspoken rules as you go along. Ultimately, it went alright. The department survived through tumultuous times — both internal and geopolitical — to publish another day; I had the privilege of leading our talented staff and contributing writers as they created some genuinely beautiful work; no one died (barely). There are a number of things I’d do differently if I could turn back time, but that’s true of any leadership gig, and I’d like to think I did the best I could with the resources and knowledge I had.The lesson I’m most grateful to take away from my time at Recess is agency. It’s funny to look back on how terrified I was before the first interview I ever conducted for The Chronicle. I guess I was somehow convinced that my interviewee, by virtue of having created something beautiful that people wanted to read about, belonged to some different, elite class of human — the mysterious Order of People Allowed to Make Important Things — and that I, as a lowly Consumer of Stuff Made by Important People, was intruding on her valuable time. That fear dissipated as she and I started talking, and I realized the obvious: She was just a person like me, with an inner life like mine, excited to chat about what she’d created and share how others might achieve the same. And all I had to do to initiate that chat, to gain that wisdom, was shoot her a three-line email! My brief tenure as Recess editor compounded that sense of wonder. If I wanted to talk to someone, no matter how far above me they seemed, I could just ask; the worst they could do was say no. If I thought that something interesting happening in the world deserved more attention, I could pitch it, or create a system that encouraged our staff to pitch more of it, and speak it into existence.While that’s not a power exclusive to Recess, I think it’s especially interesting in the context of art and artists. The creation and appreciation of art have much lower barriers to entry than people tend to assume. But as algorithms and the sanitization of the Internet increasingly curate our digital experiences, we are increasingly funneled toward mass-produced content and away from the physical spaces where art happens organically. This reshaping of our attention coincides with a growing disconnect between communities and local creativity. When we cover events at Duke or in Durham for Recess, I'm often struck by how the small crowds don't reflect the beauty of the work being presented; beyond email newsletters and word-of-mouth, these events often remain invisible to people who might deeply connect with them. This same dynamic makes emerging artists believe they need viral recognition to validate their work, changing themselves in order to better hew to the opaque whims of black-box algorithm, even as the most meaningful artistic experiences often happen in small, intimate settings where creators and audiences can genuinely engage with each other.Creating art and thoughtfully developing your own taste is a meaningful act of agency — a way to reclaim your attention from those who’ve diverted it elsewhere for their own personal gain, and to build a life that reflects your authentic values and goals. Engaging with local creators and art outside the mainstream preserves something essential that might otherwise be lost: our awareness of our shared community and humanity.I hope Recess will continue to do what it did for me: show people how accessible transformative art is to experience, and how achievable it is to create art that will transform you in return. Jules Kourelakos is a senior who served as Recess managing editor for The Chronicle’s 120th volume. She would like to thank Zev van Zanten and Anna Rebello for all of the hard work they’ve put in this year; Kadin Purath, who is an incredible person to follow in their footsteps; Katherine Zhong, whose unwavering friendship and kindness was what made her stick with The Chronicle when the going got tough; and Valeska Gomez Alvarado for making her sit down, stop procrastinating, and write this piece (even after she was so cruel as to mistakenly consume the entirety of Gomez Alvarado’s family-size bag of Cheez-Its)."
"Oh, the places you’ll go",Karen Xu,2025-04-23T10:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-xu-oh-places-youll-go-20250423.html,"Sitting in the back of Dom’s car after shooting my final Duke basketball game, it hit me just how much I’m going to miss this: the carpool karaoke, hauling around two backpacks of equipment, the wonderment walking into a new arena, the pure adrenaline coursing through me while frantically editing photos during halftime, the sleepy small talk on the drives home after the adrenaline wore off.In my time as photo editor, I’ve gotten to shoot games in iconic stadiums (it’s been a lifelong dream of mine to shoot in Madison Square Garden), sitting criss-cross on arena floors, cameras in hand, lying in wait for something magical to unfold in front of the lens. I’ve also documented uncomfortable yet ever important protests, rallies and vigils held on campus. This job has taken me to many places. Literally — from Durham to Clemson to New York and beyond — but more than that, it’s taken me into moments of raw, fleeting emotion that I never would’ve witnessed otherwise. A missed shot as the buzzer winds down. An impassioned protest. An exchange of culture.It’s strange to think that this is the end. Not just the end of my time at The Chronicle, but the end of a chapter that gave me direction, purpose and community. When I walked into my first photo department meeting, I thought it would just be a casual way to pursue a hobby I enjoyed. I didn’t expect to find something that would anchor my Duke experience, find lifelong friends and reshape my future trajectory.This year, I had the privilege of leading a team of some of the most talented, kind and curious staff photographers. I was their editor, but more than that, I was also their cheerleader, their mentor and their friend. I watched them hone their craft and grow into storytellers with a sharp eye and even sharper instincts. ChronPhoto, you made my job so easy, and I am eternally grateful for your trust and support. I truly loved every second of it.If you’d had asked me a year ago what I wanted to do after graduation, I would’ve rattled off a list of generic public service jobs that people who graduate with a degree in public policy go on to do. Maybe I would’ve hesitantly said that I maybe wanted to go into journalism. Maybe I could tell stories about trends in education policy, or the state of democracy, or even a professional sports team. But now as I am staring down the barrel of graduation, I am more uncertain than ever what’s next.That’s hard to admit, especially at a place like Duke. It’s even harder to write it in a farewell column. I had always imagined it would end with a triumphant job announcement that I would be pursuing photojournalism at a newspaper of my dreams. But alas, that’s the truth. I’ve poured everything into this volume, this role and this staff, and yet I still don’t know what comes next.It’s not just me. The industry is unstable. Attacks on the press by the current administration, budget cuts and news deserts are increasingly commonplace. The future of journalism has never felt more fragile. Through it all, I still believe in it as an institution.I believe in the people I’ve worked alongside in this newsroom, who stay up until 2 a.m. because they care. I have watched in awe as my fellow student journalists chase leads, shoot double-headers, edit a new writer’s first article, and write with clarity and compassion. I believe in the power of student journalism to tell the stories of their campuses. I believe in journalism as the fourth estate and as a necessity for democracy.Five years ago, I wrote in my Duke application essay that while I was “unsure about how my love of journalism will fit into my pursuit of political science, joining a news organization like The Chronicle will prepare me to write, interact, and think about the world in a new way.” I didn’t end up doing a lot of writing during my time here, but The Chronicle has absolutely challenged how I see the world.I may not know what comes next, but I know what I’ve learned here. I’ve learned to look closely. To see the bigger picture. To sit with discomfort. To lead with kindness. To ask better questions. To celebrate the small wins. To remember the moments, big and small.And maybe that’s enough for now.A few weeks ago, I was going through my old Chronicle photos. One of them struck me despite not being a technically great or particularly dynamic photo. In it, the player is walking off the field, back to the camera. I don’t remember the result of the game, and you can’t see his face for any indication. I don’t know where he was going or how he was feeling. But he’s going.That’s where I am. Not sure where I’m going, but moving anyway.Oh, the places I’ve been. And oh, the places I’ll go.Karen Xu is a Trinity senior and served as photo editor of The Chronicle’s 120th volume. She would like to thank Abigail Bromberger for being her first mentor and a shoulder to lean on; Alyssa Ting for setting her up for success and being someone to spill the tea to; Amy Zhang for being a source of endless inspiration both in and out of Chron; and Anabel Howery, Alex Long and Wanyu Zhang for always stepping up and redefining what an editor can be. She also thanks Zoe Kolenovsky and Abby Spiller for making The Chronicle office feel like home; Sophie Levenson for being the best travel partner; Ranjan Jindal for winning second place at Kahoot on her birthday; and Martin Heintzelman and Abby DiSalvo for letting her write some objectively bad (and debatably good) blogs for the sports section and still publishing them.She would also like to thank the real adults in her life: Stephen Buckley for reigniting a fire in her that she had forgotten; Ethan Hyman for his mentorship, encouragement, advice and photos; and of course, she thanks Chrissy Beck for offering every kind of support imaginable to keep her and the department going — emotional, financial, professional and personal.Finally, she thanks her dad, a photographer himself, for planting the first seeds of her love of her craft by giving her her first camera for Christmas in second grade. Everything started there."
A fortune cookie come true,Abby Spiller,2025-04-23T10:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/farewell-column-spiller-fortune-cookie-come-true-20250423.html,"“The prospect of a thrilling time is ahead.”Hailing from a green-walled sushi restaurant in Washington, D.C., during my gap semester in spring 2023, this quote, printed on a fortune cookie slip, quickly found its home in the back of my phone case.Though just a random fortune cookie slip, I yearned for those eight words to come true. As a then-aspiring transfer student who took time off of college after three semesters, I dreamed of a college experience rooted in fulfillment — academically, socially and personally.Still, at the time, that felt out of reach. And plus, who actually takes those fortunes seriously? But now, looking back on my anxious anticipation of what was next, I laugh at how little I knew about what the future would hold.Truly, a thrilling time was ahead.* * *301 Flowers immediately welcomed me in its musty, but charming, newsroom fashion. The 68-year-old walls bore the bounds of 119 years of journalistic excellence, where students served as the watchdog of Duke, before Duke was Duke. Yet at the time, I couldn’t fathom that history. As someone who still used the maps app to navigate around campus, I couldn’t have told you who the president of Duke was, let alone how to get to the Social Sciences building from my dorm in Kilgo House P.But I did know that if there was one way I, a former journalism major, was going to get to know my home for the next three years, it would be through The Chronicle. And from this, I learned far more about this University than who its president is — and less than six months later, was elected the paper’s incoming editor-in-chief.Throughout my time on the paper, I covered national politics at Duke (and got to ride in a vice presidential candidate’s motorcade!), a Commencement walkout, a University fundraising campaign and even received the tip that Crystal Mangum admitted to fabricating the 2006 lacrosse scandal as I was walking into the Perkins first floor bathroom.And every Sunday through Thursday night — and the occasional “Chron weekend” (Friday and Saturday) — I would trek up the seemingly endless flight of stairs to 301 Flowers where I edited close to a total-thousand news stories before they hit our website. From shuffling through interview transcripts to completing the final round of edits and clicking the “publish” button, seeing all of the stories of our University and community through the editing process was — simply put — inspiring. The Chronicle is incomplete without the stories that shape the day-to-day of Duke’s history.But most of all, the biggest thrill The Chronicle gave me was the sense of deep and profound purpose. Entering Duke as a transfer student was lonely. At best, I saw myself blending in, quietly finding my way in the sea of a student body twice the size of my last university. However, The Chronicle trusted me, threw me into the action and gave me the most fulfilling experience I could have asked for in a lifetime, let alone in my college career.Though it was hard, though I had to decline many dinners and late-night hangouts with my friends and though I sometimes wondered what my life would be like not as editor-in-chief, somehow it was always worth it. The people, our mission and my deep reverence for student journalism kept me going.Through the paper, I also found an amazingly kind and intelligent community of journalists and friends who never cease to impress me. Their words, archived in ink and pixels or a moment in a photograph, will forever tell the story of this University was, is and aspires to be.So that’s all to say that serving as the editor-in-chief of The Chronicle has been the honor of a lifetime. It was an opportunity I never fathomed was in reach, was difficult in a way words can’t describe, but one I would reach for in every other lifetime.As I write this farewell column April 22 and look to tomorrow, when I am no longer at the thrilling-helm of this paper, I am feeling bittersweet. But, having only three years at this institution I have grown to love, I am excited to spend more time with my friends, take more walks in the gardens and maybe have a normal sleep schedule again.With my height now sharpied on the door frame of the editor’s office and a note scribbled on the wall for the future editors to come, I — with bags under my eyes — look back on the past year proud of all we have accomplished and ready to pass on this paper to the next 120 lucky editors-in-chief to come.Though a farewell to Volume 120, this is not a farewell to The Chronicle — for which the prospect of a thrilling time lies ahead.Abby Spiller is a Trinity junior and served as the editor-in-chief for The Chronicle’s 120th volume. She would like to thank her incredible team of editors, starting with Managing Editor Michael Austin and News Editor Zoe Kolenovsky, with whom she truly could not have completed this year without. She will miss every crazy and delusional late night editing shift with them in 301 Flowers. Next to Sports Editor Ranjan Jindal, Opinion Editor Alice Qin, Recess Editor Zev van Zanten and Photo Editors Karen Xu and Morgan Chu, who are the smartest and most inquisitive section heads she could have asked for, and who constantly pushed the bounds of this paper. Thank you to Volume 119 leadership for trusting and encouraging her to run for the position, Courtney Mitchell for being the kindest mentor, Volume 103 Editor-in-Chief David Graham for his wisdom and honesty and to Volume 112 Editor-in-Chief Claire Ballentine for answering quite literally every frantic phone call throughout this crazy year.She could not give thanks without recognizing her parents and brother, who, somehow knowing this year was going to be harder than she could have ever fathomed, supported her each and every step along the way. She would also like to thank Chrissy Murray, her Chronicle mom, though no amount of thank-yous does her justice for all she has done for this paper over the years, as well as the entire business office, which helps make the editorial side run with ease. And thank you to Betsy Mullen, her first journalism professor at the University of Richmond, who instilled within her a love of journalism.Finally, she wants to thank everyone who has contributed to The Chronicle throughout its 120 years. Editors-in-chief truly stand on the shoulders of those who came before them — those who set a standard of journalistic excellence and what it means to run an organization that is bigger than any one person. The Chronicle will always hold the most special place in her heart."
"Workers at Duke deserve better wages, conditions and support: My story",Lee Brodie,2025-04-22T10:01:00Z,Apr,22,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/workers-duke-better-conditions-story-20250422.html,"I am Lee Brodie, a Durham native. I have been employed with Duke’s Facilities Management (FMD) for almost seven years. Within my position as a heavy equipment operator, I am responsible daily for maintaining the horticulture and grounds of West Campus. Through methods of operating heavy machinery, mowing, bed edging, weed eating, backpack blowing and litter collection are daily tasks. Taking pride in my work is a thrill, receiving compliments while on campus makes the work worthwhile. For generations, my family has worked with Duke. My great grandmother, grandmother, mother, father, sisters, aunts, uncles and cousins have been a pivotal part of Duke's work culture. What brought me to Duke was not only my family, nor the fact that I was an avid Duke basketball fan. It was knowing the opportunity would allow me to provide and create a family of my own. Within the FMD department, ground workers — which we are often called — consist of Black and brown employees. Just like my own family, generations of their families have also worked throughout Duke. Many of these employees possess more than five years, if not decades, of seniority in their positions. Unfortunately, these employees are not being paid a sufficient wage. Investing years of life to earn less than $20 hourly is not reasonable, nor does it assist with the increased cost of living. While working as a Duke employee, I have also witnessed racial bias throughout my career. In my experience, this has created conflict and separation between employees and employers. For example, in the first year or so into my career at the University, I overheard a white coworker call another Black coworker a racial slur. As a Black man, this made me feel incredibly disrespected and hurt, and I continued to have tensions with that coworker and my supervisor. The incident, among others, was reported to management. Due to lack of response, I also contacted the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) and Human Resources (HR). In the end, I’m not aware of any disciplinary action taken for that specific incident. Throughout my career, I have contacted HR, OIE, and Staff and Labor Relations, from issues such as timecard errors (causing loss of pay), to other conflicts, including a physical confrontation that I had with my supervisor. When I have expressed my concerns, investigations which were open have since been closed.Community involvement is pivotal in supporting workers in these times. I understand that it is not the duty of students, staff or alumni to correct this. We are only seeking support in this time of need. Many Duke employees hold union positions, when wages are discussed, they are often deflected. Employees are told to direct those issues to our union leadership. A new union bargaining contract will be signed in May, which will determine the wages, hours and overall responsibilities of union workers for the next three years. Workers are currently operating on a 2017 bargaining wage scale. Since 2017, the cost of living has risen tremendously, unfortunately our wages have not. We must find a remedy to resolve the overall treatment of employees and the poor actions of management. My hope is that future generations who enter Duke’s work environment will never have to face the type of experiences which we are presently facing at this time. Lee Brodie is a heavy equipment operator for facilities management. "
"Before we leave campus, let’s talk about who can’t",Noor Nazir,2025-04-22T10:00:00Z,Apr,22,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/before-leave-campus-talk-who-cant-20250422.html,"Let’s assume the federal immigration system is broken. That part’s been said.What hasn’t been said enough is what happens when universities like Duke don’t step in more proactively. Even well-intentioned support can fall short for students in the immigration system today. As summer break approaches, some students are packing for road trips or flights home within the U.S. Others are quietly canceling their tickets abroad — not out of choice, but out of fear they may not be allowed to return.In recent months, a wave of unease has swept across Duke’s international community. Just this year, the federal government terminated the visas of three Duke community members — two graduate students and one alumnus.Before another international student’s visa is revoked, Duke needs to ask itself a hard question: What are we doing to protect the students we promised to welcome?International students make up 18.3% of Duke’s student body. And for many, their F-1 visas have become symbols of both pride and peril. That said, I don’t know every story. But I do know the fear tucked quietly into the lives of my international friends.In recent months, a wave of unease has swept across Duke’s international community. What happens when a student’s visa is revoked overnight? When they’re barred from re-entering the country after visiting family? Or when an OPT delay forces them out of work?We need to talk about the practical realities that follow these moments: sudden displacement, housing insecurity, loss of income and mental health tolls — all while far from home, and often with no family nearby.So, what could Duke be doing?Emergency housingOn April 18, Duke formally advised international students to avoid all “non-essential” international travel, citing increased risks of visa revocations, reentry denial and intensified inspections at U.S. borders. The message was clear: don’t leave.But for those who can’t return home the question remains: stay where?Each summer, most campus housing sits unused, except for a few programs and visiting scholars. Duke could reserve a block of empty dorm rooms, specifically for international students facing travel restrictions, visa complications or safety concerns. If not dormitory housing, the Duke International Student Center could establish a secure, vetted platform to match students with faculty offering free and safe temporary housing. The program can potentially pair individual students to designated faculty mentors, advisors or willing Durham residents.Bridge fundingWhen international students face sudden visa complications — delays in OPT approval, the loss of on-campus employment eligibility or administrative errors — it often results in an immediate loss of income. With federal proposals aimed at stripping immigrants of even their Social Security numbers, universities should be prepared to act swiftly.In these moments, Duke should not offer paperwork. It should offer help.Rather than requiring students to navigate an opaque, bureaucratic financial aid process, Duke could establish a dedicated emergency bridge fund designed specifically for students in immigration-related crises.This fund could provide short-term support for undergraduate or graduate students who suddenly lose their income; this could cover rent and utility payments, groceries or meal points, emergency travel expenses if a student is required to leave the U.S. unexpectedly and legal documentation fees tied to visa-related issues. The application process should be swift, simple and confidential, ideally coordinated through the Duke International Student Center in collaboration with the Financial Aid Office.Mental health support Duke’s Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) offers general resources, but rarely addresses the emotional strain of legal uncertainty in a culturally sound way. CAPS could focus on hiring culturally competent counselors trained in the intersection of immigration, identity and trauma. It could also offer group therapy spaces specifically for international students coping with legal anxiety, displacement or isolation. Ensuring language accessibility is key: It’s important to include counselors who speak major languages represented in the international student body. The Duke International Student Center could collaborate closely with CAPS to create mental health workshops and resources focused on visa-related stress and adjustment. Given that summer is approaching, these resources should be readily available online for students who are not on campus or are unable to access in-person services. For international students, therapy isn’t just about midterm anxiety — it’s often about the existential uncertainty of whether they’ll be allowed to stay at all.A moment that demands more Duke has asked international students to stay. But staying safely — staying housed, supported, and protected — requires more than an email. It requires action.Some faculty and researchers, including those at the Kenan Institute for Ethics, are already collecting anonymous student accounts through an encrypted form. They have started gathering stories from all Duke students. This is not for press releases or panels, it's to record emotions that often become easy to forget. These stories, shared anonymously and securely, are a way to make sure the fear, displacement and uncertainty aren’t erased from the institutional memory of this moment.That kind of care matters — and it’s often faculty and researchers who lead by example. But their efforts shouldn’t have to fill the gaps left by institutional inaction.I acknowledge that funding cuts have been difficult, and the university has hinted at future employment actions. But if supporting students is central to Duke’s mission — and it should be — then it can’t be the first thing to fall through the cracks. If higher management truly believes international students are vital members of its community, then it must take action during the next four months. With the significant investments made in senior leadership, I trust that the university has both the resources and capacity to find a way forward.Duke asked international students to stay. Now it must prove it’s a place worth staying for.Noor Nazir is a Trinity sophomore. Her pieces typically run on alternate Tuesdays."
You can be an artist,Arya Krishnan,2025-04-22T10:00:00Z,Apr,22,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/you-can-be-an-artist-20250422.html,"“So, what’s your major?” “Music.” “Wow, that’s so cool! But what will you do after you graduate?” At this point in the conversation, existential dread seeps in, and I silently start plotting my exit strategy. Still, I must respond to the question so as not to become a social outcast. “I’m not really sure.” My stated uncertainty is very much the truth. I have no idea where I’ll be, what I’ll be doing or how I will earn a living. This situation may sound terrifying, but as an arts kid, you learn to embrace the uncertainty. As a Duke student who regularly attends basketball games, you learn a thing or two about confidence, bravado and perseverance. “I want to be a pop star!” I say proudly from my chest with a big smile. The name-hometown-major conversation concludes, and everyone lives happily ever after. Except for me. Now I’m left wondering — can I actually be an artist, or is that just something we’re supposed to leave to the realm of dream and fantasy? Fortunately, I don’t have time to wonder, because I have coursework to get to. But is going to classes and being in college even helping me? What’s the point of being at Duke? I thought it might be more relevant if I were either at an arts-centered school like Berklee College of Music or had dropped out and fully focused on improving my craft. Today, I wonder no longer. I’m convinced that right here at Duke, magic can be made. Duke doesn’t just produce politicians and portfolio managers, but also poets, philosophers and pop stars. This world of possibility wasn’t an instant realization, but took years of adventuring as a Duke student and an independent creative artist. I was on the set of my first film when I first considered the possibility. During a break from shooting, my producer, then a senior with extensive experience on sets, explained why the Duke experience surpasses that at a film school like the University of Southern California or New York University. She argued that those schools, due to their specialization, are like cookie cutters. At a college like Duke, however, you have the opportunity to become an independent thinker as well as deeply knowledgeable in not just one but a whole range of disciplines. This argument didn’t immediately convince me. I told my producer that all that sounds great on paper, but knowledge alone won’t translate into art — you have to put things into practice — and it was the practical side of things that I had found lacking in my classes. I felt that my classes were a burden and took away time that I could have spent making music. So instead, I looked for other opportunities to get creative, and one of them was with my friends. Although they weren’t studying music, we all loved music. Like most friend groups, we’d get together in one of our dorm rooms each night to chill and listen to good music.Then, we had the itch to get more active. We’d find hip-hop and trap beats on YouTube and give our best shot at freestyle rapping. While my friends would be popping off, I struggled to contribute, being both introverted and self-conscious.I fed off my friends' energy and took inspiration from them. I realized that I had been putting so much pressure on myself as an artist that I was blocking all my creative flow. Meanwhile, my friends were just enjoying themselves, and in doing so, they were spitting bars that not only flowed but were meaningful. If it weren’t for my friends, I would never have had the courage, confidence and ability to express my voice. One day, in the middle of a prolific session, my friend remarked that we were “giving him the Beatles vibes.” It was a bold statement to make, and I was hesitant about any comparison to such a legendary establishment, but he had a point. Before all the fame and success, the Beatles were just a bunch of bros who would get together to have a laugh and sing their hearts out. To me, that was a huge reminder about one of the most important parts of college — having fun. However, I wasn’t satisfied with just having fun. I also wanted to make good music, and so this semester I signed up for a composition course, hoping to develop as an artist.I was expecting to sit back and do a lot of listening and score analysis, but I was immediately thrown into the deep end — from the very first week, I had to compose something and share it with the class. As a new composer, my professor also gave me a restriction — it had to be monophonic, meaning no harmonies. Most, if not every, song features some kind of harmony, so my professor meant the challenge to be a little unconventional.Luckily, I had an ace up my sleeve — this is where all the time producing trap beats for my friends came in clutch. Instead of writing the piece out on sheet music, I used my familiarity with electronic production to create an actual track. With the help of my microphone and synthesizer, I was able to record all the parts, as well as mix and master them. As I played my composition in class, it hit me — my time here at Duke directly inspired everything about my piece. Drawing from my time singing in the Chapel Choir, I decided to write a monophonic Catholic Mass. I added my twist to this by fusing the historical tradition with the range of genres and cultures I had encountered on campus, from gospel rock to East Asian music. My courses were no longer just pedagogical; I was also seeing how much I was taking away from my music history and theory courses. Igor Stravinsky, one of the most popular 20th-century composers, once said, “Great artists steal.” Whenever I heard something that spoke to me in class, it’d go straight into my music. My professor and classmates enjoyed my piece. My professor was happy that what could’ve just been a pedantic exercise was made into a genuine, expressive work. “See you next week, composers!” he said to us as we left.Being referred to as a “composer” was a special distinction. I realized that I’m already an artist. Just by creating and sharing, you’ve earned the right to call yourself an artist. No longer was there a distinction between “academic” work and “personal” work. I completed my assignment and uploaded it to streaming platforms, then went on to work with my professor on writing pop songs.One week, our professor invited a reputed composer to attend our class. He was so excited to see and hear what the latest batch of artists were up to that he decided to do a recorded interview with each one of us. He asked me what I see myself doing with music, and I thought back to all the conversations I had that started like this. I told him that I love music, but I also want to have fun and be a pop star. I said it as a bit of a joke, worried about how my professor and the guest composer would react. The composer’s response reassured me: “Mozart always wanted to be an icon; there’s nothing wrong with that.”Arya Krishnan is a Trinity senior. His column typically runs on alternate Thursdays."

We are under attack,Thomas Nechyba,2025-04-21T10:00:00Z,Apr,21,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/we-are-under-attack-20250421.html,"Last fall, I had the unenviable task of facing over 500 students in Griffith Theater for my 10 a.m. ECON 101 class the day after the presidential election. Throughout the semester, I had lunch with many of my students, and they had spoken to me openly about their fears and hopes. Regardless of the election outcome, I therefore knew some would be devastated while others would be elated — and so, days before election day, I had decided to have 500 donuts delivered at the beginning of class to lighten the mood. But in the morning hours before my class, with the outcome now known, I had to figure out what I would say to go along with the donut delivery. How could I find words to give comfort and hope to those who were devastated without disrespecting those who were elated?While I had gone through pains in my class to be even-handed in discussions about the economic issues raised during the campaign, the class knew that my own vote in the election had little to do with traditional economic issues. I had publicly supported the Harris campaign not so much as an economist but rather as a citizen — I was deeply concerned about leadership that, in the name of “disrupting” the status quo, would further pit us against one another and lead to a downward spiral that could spell the end of much of what we as citizens hold dear. Yet I had gotten to know many students who voted for Donald Trump as people of good will, people with their own fears about the future and a very different read on the dangers of Trump’s “disruption.”So I began by addressing the Trump supporters in the class. I explained to them that to those who were on the other side, this did not feel like the day after an ordinary election where our side happened to have lost. We were afraid, deeply afraid, not of economic policies we disagree with, but of the threats, openly made during the campaign, to our civil society, to the human rights of many and to the dignity of all. I asked that those who supported Trump try to understand the depth of these fears. But I also asked students who shared these fears to see in their Trump-supporting peers what I had seen during my lunch conversations: Most had not voted for Trump because of the hateful rhetoric and cruel threats; they had done so in spite of them, and in the conviction that constructive policies would take the place of what they saw as the mere theater of the campaign rhetoric. None of us, I told the students, could see the future, and perhaps not all of what those on my side feared would transpire. But — and now I turned back to my Trump supporting students — if it turns out that our fears were well founded, if the U.S. embarks on the cruel path to autocracy, if individuals are cast aside and neighbors are arbitrarily targeted, I trust that those of us who opposed Trump’s election can count on you to fight alongside us and not look the other way. We can disagree on policy of all kinds, but if the fundamental nature of our democracy is attacked, if there is mockery and demagoguery that turns to concrete violations of individual rights and liberty, if a concerted effort to spread fear and hate takes hold, I trust we will all stand united regardless of who we supported in the election. The dark storm clouds have been building since that day, and last week, they came to the doorsteps of our own university as some of our international students, like hundreds more around the country, received word that their visas had been revoked. The pretense for visa revocations like this across U.S. universities, with a demand to leave within days, ranges from a speeding ticket or parking violation to social media posts or participation in protests fully protected by the First Amendment. This is only the beginning. Who is targeted appears utterly arbitrary, and it is important to understand that this is a feature, not a bug, in the authoritarian playbook to spread fear, intimidation and terror. Making everyone feel like they could be next is meant, in that playbook, to crush dissent and opposition.It is far from the only sign of the path the U.S. is on — law firms are being openly targeted for representing clients, media outlets are threatened with loss of licenses, academic discourse in universities is falling victim to federal blackmail, authoritarian countries are being held up as examples to follow and there is even talk of “denaturalizing” U.S. citizens. But sometimes it is hard to see what’s truly happening until it comes to our doorstep. It is important to recognize that this is an attack on “us,” not on “them.” Ordinary policy differences have to recede to the background — and we have to find it within us to see the human being next to us, not the “other” who deserves what’s coming to them because they hail from a different place, speak a different language or hold different views. Resist the temptation to be swept up in the downward spiral of being pitted against one another that history tells us we can all get swept up in — and be there for your fellow students. It is time for us to unite and say with one voice: enough.I may have been wrong on the day after the election when I said not everything that was feared might come true. But I hope I am not wrong about my trust in those who had voted for Trump. Remember — many of you did not vote for this. Don’t let others convince you now that you did. What you do in this moment will shape who you will become — so stand with your peers and neighbors that are under attack. Thomas Nechyba is a professor of economics and public policy studies. "
Movement as a movement: Dance as a vessel for change,Aria Dwoskin,2025-04-21T09:55:00Z,Apr,21,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/dance-as-a-vessel-for-change-20250421.html,"Like many kids, I danced in elementary school, taking classes at a local studio and attending yearly recitals. But as school became the focal point of my life and the question “what will help me get into college?” became more urgent, dance — a hobby I was never naturally inclined in — began to slip out of my life. I traded my tights for debate tournaments, letting my creativity fade out of focus. But some of my closest friends didn’t. Three of my best friends at Duke are performers — singers, actors and dancers — and just last week, I sat in the audience of the Embodiment Dance Showcase to watch one of them perform. My first emotion, while watching the curtain come up and the dancers move in tandem, was awe. Each dancer moved with intention and beauty, creating community in the process. Embodiment represented a connection founded on pure passion; this was a group of people brought together not because of a resume-building opportunity, but for the sake of self-expression. They were moving for movement’s sake and for meaning’s sake. One piece wove this community and movement together to make a powerful statement — so powerful that words could not, and this article likely will not, do it justice. The piece was titled “Fissure-Prone,” choreographed by Caroline Brecke and featuring Jacki Palmer. The program description of the dance stated, “The heaviness needed for false (?) levity: some are more susceptible to it than others. This isn’t for you.” The dance starts with everyone on the ground, dancing horizontally to Guy Lombardo’s “Auld Lang Syne.” For about two minutes, the dancers moved together, until the sound of wind picked up. Then, the lead dancer Jackie steps into the middle, contorting her body in every which way, as everyone simply walks around her. She moves with desperation and intensity, yet everything around her remains calm. Her movements — both jerky and graceful — were more than just interesting technically; they were emotional, urgent and thought-provoking. It was the kind of movement that makes you, in a way, uncomfortable, and yet is still completely magnetic and inspiring. This dance illustrated the tension of being awake and in pain while others are ignorant to your suffering or simply do not care; this all felt deeply political to me. As the lead dancer twisted her body under the spotlight, it seemed emblematic of the current state of our world. We live in a country weighed down by injustice — by xenophobia, inequality, homophobia and violence — that continues to claim lives. And still, many are able to drift through their days, seemingly untouched or unworried by the suffering around them.“Fissure-Prone” seemed to speak to political exhaustion, clearly a reframing of “Auld Lang Syne.” For as the familiar New Year’s tune played, a feeling draped upon the audience not of excitement but of heaviness. The choreographer beautifully captured the deep loneliness, grief and pain of continuing on in a society overwhelmed with inequity, where so many remain unaware or indifferent. In that weight, there was a kind of resignation and acceptance — of being “fissure-prone” and fractured by the constant pressure of existing in this climate. This dance wove together struggle and alleviation, hardship and levity, ignorance and truth. It moved me in a deep way, revealing how often we overlook the body as a vehicle for protest — and how dance might be one of the most radical tools for social change. Last semester, I took DANCE 89S, Imagination for Liberation, taught by Brooks Emanuel and Michael Kliën, two deeply creative professors who are also dancers and choreographers. This class challenged us to think beyond the familiar tools of activism and consider deeper, more imaginative pathways to liberation. This kind of thinking, we learned, lives in movement. This course made it clear that the most powerful revolutions are not ones which simply rearrange policies and reimagine possibilities, but ones that shift collective consciousness — changing the masses’ thinking in profound and lasting ways. This is what dance does best, evoking raw emotion and revelations. Merriam-Webster defines imagination as “the act or power of forming a mental image of something not present to the senses or never before wholly perceived in reality.” Imagination, then, is formed by the senses and the brain, crafting a vision never truly seen before. This definition is deeply suggestive of imagination’s place in revolution: It helps us envision realities that haven’t yet existed, which is exactly what real change does. To do this, we need to draw upon our thoughts and creativity, which movement accomplishes twofold.My course taught me that movement is thinking. “Philosophy In The Flesh,” written by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, explains that the mind is not detached from the body, but is rather embodied. How we reason, how we perceive and how we understand the world is grounded in our bodily experiences. Following this logic, the body, and thus the movement of it, shapes the very nature of conceptualization. And imagination, at its core, is deep conceptualization. Choreographer Susan Leigh Foster deepens this idea in her lecture “What Dancing Does,” where she lifts her arm and asks, “What if this is a thought?” She explains that studies suggest that cognition isn’t limited to the brain, but rather occurs through sensory motor feedback loops across neuromuscular and perceptual systems. Our bodies don’t just carry out thinking; they are thinking. Our kinesthetic system extracts meaning from our environment in a crucial way. Dance, then, is more than just an expression. It is a deeper way of knowing and understanding. And yet, this is rarely acknowledged. Our culture privileges linear thinking, measurable output, and productivity. We are subjects in a system that churns out agents of capitalism rather than imaginative changemakers. Adrienne Maree Brown, in “Pleasure Activism: The Politics of Feeling Good,” characterized this phenomenon: “We are in an imagination battle.” As a result, our thinking narrows, our modes of expression diminish, and we accept the injustices around us as inevitable. This must change. As writer Audre Lorde reminded us, “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” Activism that stays within the bounds of the systems we’re trying to resist — through essays or social media posts or conventional methods of protests — will never be enough. To truly transform society, we must break free from those structures. We must think differently and move differently. Movement is the foundation for radical solutions.Dance not only generates thought, but it echoes in those watching, too. Though I remained seated in the audience, I was sparked by a line of thinking rooted in sensation, intuition and imagination. As a public policy major, I spend much of my time reading dense texts about systemic inequality and social injustice. Yet no article or dataset has moved me, intellectually or emotionally, as deeply as Caroline Brecke’s “Fissure-Prone.” Through her masterful choreography, Brecke brought suffering, resistance and urgency to life. This piece embodied what it means to be truly awake — to care deeply and keep moving, even under the weight of a world that urges silence and willful ignorance. In the process, she reminded me this is exactly what movement can do — it is a radical form of thought, imagination, defiance and liberation.Aria Dwoskin is a Trinity first-year.

Protecting student journalism: Rumeysa Ozturk and the tilting risk-reward equation of free speech,Alice Qin,2025-04-18T10:00:00Z,Apr,18,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/ozturk-tilting-risk-reward-equation-free-speech-20250418.html,"Two weeks ago on an ordinary Tuesday afternoon, I was preparing an op-ed by one of my writers for publication. The piece — which, in my unbiased opinion, was beautifully written — analyzed the targeting of international students by the current administration. The writer drew on their experiences growing up in an authoritarian country, illustrating parallels between current moments and their upbringing. Over the past year, I spent considerable hours working with Duke community members — both guest contributors and Chronicle staff — on columns covering a variety of contentious issues. When there was one that I thought would spark an important, even if it was uncomfortable, conversation, I felt excited to click the “publish” button. This time, I was instead hit with a pang of anxiety. Just months ago, the notion that penning an op-ed in a student newspaper would put someone at risk of deportation would have seemed inconceivable, or at least of minimal possibility. That no longer feels like the case. The story of Rumeysa Ozturk, a doctoral student at Tufts University who was arrested off the street, has been widely reported. According to Ozturk’s friends and colleagues, her only known activism was co-authoring an op-ed in Tufts' student newspaper.The aforementioned author I was working with was an international student. On top of losing educational opportunities, they would face tremendous personal harm if forced to return to their home country. The probability of deportation as a result of this specific op-ed is indeterminable, but recent news cycles convey that it is now nonzero. Even if the author's name was anonymized, anecdotes anchoring the article possessed identifying information — removing the author’s identity would have erased the article’s meaning.After several conversations with the writer, we decided not to run it. This example is all but an incredibly small instance of a nationwide chilling effect. Editors from a range of campus publications reported seeing increased requests to take down articles and anonymize names, due to concerns about being associated with pieces “that could get them in trouble.” In an email yesterday, Duke cautioned international students “to be mindful of their digital footprint and recognize its potential impact on their immigration status.” On April 4, a collection of student press organizations released an alert “never before issued.”Ultimately, I’ve noticed what seems to be a fundamental issue of free speech exercise within our media environment: the dramatic asymmetry in the risks and rewards of expression. Speech feels as accessible as ever through the digital sphere. Consumer-generated content has grown: As Elon Musk famously declared, “You are the media now.” Accessibility, though, is distinct from reach. The chances of spontaneous virality have grown with digital platforms, but news cycles have quickened and fragmented. The reward of putting your thoughts out into the world, beyond the intrinsic value of speech, has become highly uncertain. What has become certain, though, is that the advent of digital media has rapidly increased the ease of surveillance — granted, the apparatus for monitoring speech activities was developed far before this year. However, the way that the current administration has chosen to deploy these tools has meaningfully magnified both perceived and actual risk.Here is the problem in concrete terms: Sure, it has gotten easier to publish, say, an op-ed you wrote for the campus newspaper through the internet. But how many people will actually read it? And what is the probability that the United States government is the one that does and decides to take issue with it? It’s becoming less and less worth it to take that chance, for anyone. And, if dissent is an indispensable component of democratic enterprise, that’s a problem — especially for student journalism.This is a precarious moment in higher education where every university desperately needs a witness. Regardless of whether they are read, student newspapers are crucial bodies of historical information for universities. Through first-person op-eds or interviews in news articles, they provide consistent and formalized ways of documenting the perspectives of community members. If students believe it is no longer worth it to share their thoughts in a documented capacity — due to the prospect of being deported, detained or otherwise punished — we simply cannot do our jobs.However, threats to the existence of student newspapers are not unique to this Trump administration: It has also come from the very universities they are part of. Two months ago, Appalachian State administrators ordered The Appalachian to clear out their storage room of newspapers, threatening the existence of archives. Last December, University of Southern California administrators reduced The Daily Trojan’s print schedule and eliminated pay for staff members — without consulting the paper’s leadership. Due to financial instability, college papers across the country have struggled with independence, which can negatively impact campus transparency. I don’t expect universities to resolve fundamental flaws with our speech environment, but I do expect universities to recognize student journalism as a critical ally — rather than a nuisance — in reckoning with modern threats.Some student newspapers, like The Chronicle, have been here longer than the universities themselves. We were there for all of the unprecedented times that the University has lived through. This is a reminder that it might need us to navigate — and document — this one.Alice Qin is a Trinity senior and opinion editor of The Chronicle’s 120th volume."
Is due process dead? The answer lies in El Salvador,Leo Goldberg,2025-04-17T10:00:00Z,Apr,17,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/due-process-el-salvador-20250417.html,"Every time I think I’ve written enough articles to sufficiently cover the fast-moving pace of the current presidential administration, the endlessly-giving generosity of President Donald Trump provides me with yet more ammunition to spray across the front page of The Chronicle's opinion section. This time, it concerns his flagrant immigration policy, which has now led to a direct constitutional crisis regarding the fundamental civil liberties of United States residents. Every week, a new case involving the disappearance and deportation of legal immigrants in the U.S. emerges, amounting to blatant government overreach. Unfortunately, our own university, Duke, has not been exempt. Earlier this month, the federal government terminated the visas of two Duke graduate students and an alumnus. Senior Associate Dean of International Students Kevin D’Arco stated that the students are consulting their immigration attorneys regarding the visa terminations. But Trump has shown open contempt for any legal challenge to his deportation edicts in threats to law firms and immigration attorneys, and is likely to attempt to follow his previous pattern of denying them a trial to remain in the U.S.In ordering the arrest and deportation of legal immigrants on bogus charges in disregard of the law, Trump earned the legal reprimand of the Supreme Court, which intervened in a recent case that has rocked our country. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man from Maryland who has been legally living in the U.S. since seeking refuge from El Salvador in 2019, was mistakenly and illegally deported back to El Salvador by Trump on March 15. Garcia, and others like him, were subject to targeted interference by the federal government and denied fundamental constitutional liberties. Garcia was simply whisked away by the government on false charges and no criminal record, completely by accident. What we are now consequently witnessing is the unraveling of one of the most essential rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution: that of due process.Found in both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, due process sanctifies the right of every individual inside the U.S., including non-citizens, not to have their inalienable liberties deprived by the government without first undergoing certain legal procedures such as a trial. So important is this principle that due process remains the only command in the Constitution to be repeated twice. First appearing in the Fifth Amendment, a second iteration is stated in the Fourteenth Amendment, reading, “No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” In utterly disregarding due process, Trump has made war on the U.S. Constitution. According to a recent article on the matter from Politico, “critics and legal experts have argued that the case sets a dangerous precedent of allowing the executive branch the expansive and chilling power to imprison individuals in different countries without due process — especially as Trump continues to float sending U.S. citizens to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center.” As the end of the above quote suggests, Trump has even expressed enthusiasm at the idea of sending American offenders to be detained in El Salvador’s notorious mega-prisons, inaugurating a whole new untread legal and political nightmare. The designated location for sending these prisoners has a special kind of significance though, one which deserves scrutiny. Alongside Trump in his purge of due process has been a staunch new ally of the U.S., President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador. From the inception of the second Trump administration, El Salvador’s dictator-esque president has warmly endorsed and welcomed the plan to host American criminals in El Salvador’s uniquely repulsive prisons. Just this last week, Trump affectionately hosted Bukele in the Oval Office, where they both sneered about the human trafficking of Abrego Garcia and vilely pretended neither of them had the power to return the man back to the U.S. What is this perverse love-relationship that has developed between El Salvador and the United States? Who is Bukele, and why is he being fondly embraced in the Oval Office as an ally by Trump? These questions may provide a very revealing clue as to what Trump’s disregard for due process may look like in our country if carried out to its full extent, because it has already happened under Bukele in El Salvador. Bukele was first elected as El Salavdor’s president in 2019 on a promise to crack down on the country’s spiraling crisis of gang violence. His administration certainly delivered on this pledge, rounding up 80,000 presumed gang members and throwing them into maximum security “terrorism confinement centers.” The resulting wave of popularity he received from this catapulted him to a landslide victory for a second term in 2024, winning 85% of the popular vote, effectively empowering him to exercise presidential power however he chose and leading to proclaiming himself the “world's coolest dictator.” While Bukele did drastically reduce gang violence in El Salvador, the methods used were Orwellian in their violation of civil liberties. Declaring a state of emergency that placed few limits on the power of the federal government, Bukele’s troops went door to door arresting thousands of people, often arbitrarily. Due process was systematically disregarded as individual trials, a right guaranteed in El Salvador, were bypassed in favor of mass trials which delivered draconian verdicts. Amidst this hysteria, thousands of innocent people were mistakenly arrested, as were thousands of children, prompting the alarm of international human rights groups who condemned what they asserted as gross human rights violations.Bukele’s concentration of power eroded El Salvador’s democracy in less conspicuous ways too. In 2021, using his party’s legislative majority, Bukele dismissed five of the judges on El Salvador’s Supreme Court, replacing them with loyalists instead. The move came just in time for Bukele to announce his intention to seek a second term in 2024, despite the fact that the El Salvadoran Constitution limits presidents to a single 5-year term. Bukele’s newly-appointed corrupt judges proceeded to rule it admissible for him to bypass the Constitution and run for reelection, which is the only reason the self-proclaimed dictator still leads El Salvador.Now, it isn’t new or surprising to see a self-appointed strongman like Bukele willingly make the trade-off of sacrificing civil liberties in favor of order. That is, after all, the apparatus of dictators. But what is fascinating is the explosive popularity that Bukele has consistently enjoyed from the public whose rights are the ones being denied. The benefits of reduced gang violence have allowed Bukele to convince the public in El Salvador that the civil liberties trade-off is a worthy one. As a result, El Salvador’s system of checks and balances has crumbled, perhaps irreversibly, and dissent has been crushed. 61% percent of El Salvadorans now report self-censoring out of fear of expressing their opinions. This means that when the jubilation over Bukele eventually breaks, and his popularity begins to slip, there will be little power the people possess to stop him, all with the full knowledge that they were led to willingly sacrifice this power. Everything described above is taking place in its latent stage in the United States as Trump solidifies control. Due process is to him a worthy and necessary sacrifice in the name of preserving America (himself), and the fulfillment of his own flirtations with the unconstitutional idea of running for a third term remains to be seen in the hands of our own Trump-sympathizing judges Supreme Court. But on a deeper societal level, what is most concerning is that Trump is finding success in copying Bukele’s strategy of persuading the people that due process is a worthy sacrifice too. Americans are subtly being fed the illusion that the dismantling of democracy is in our best interest for the sake of protection against allegedly impending security threats. But unlike in the case of Bukele where rampant gang violence posed a legitimate threat to safety, the narrative touted by Trump of the “security threat” posed to America by supposedly dangerous immigrants, is a problem that, in reality, is overstated and unsolved by Trump’s policies. All eyes should now be on El Salvador. Its abrogation of civil liberties in the name of safety is precisely the model on which Trump is basing his rule, and if any country can show us what America may look like if our constitutional rights continue to be capitulated, it is El Salvador. Its democracy index has slipped every year of Bukele’s regime, receiving a rating of 70 out of 100 in 2018, and subsequently declining to 47 out of 100 in 2025. In El Salvador, Bukele has shown us what happens when due process dies. In America, it is our due diligence to make sure it stays alive. Leo Goldberg is a Trinity first-year.

Medicine beyond the bubble: What I learned working outside Duke Health,Kareena Sukhnanan,2025-04-17T10:00:00Z,Apr,17,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/working-outside-duke-health-20250417.html,"At Duke, we live steps away from a top-ranked hospital, just across from the Rubenstein Library and the Davison Building. But that proximity can deceive us into thinking access is universal. It’s not. For a few months, I worked as a medical assistant at a local urgent care clinic in Durham — just a short 15-minute drive from Duke’s campus, but a world away from the environment many of us as students are used to.At Duke, we often speak about medicine in abstract, aspirational terms: gleaming hospital towers, cutting-edge research labs and a health system ranked among the best in the world. It’s the Durham we see from the inside of a lecture hall or a hospital volunteer shift, full of promise, progress and possibility. When you ask a Duke student about medicine, they may talk about the gene therapy project they’re working on in their lab, or the new detection algorithm they’ve helped develop for early cancer screening. What they often don’t talk about are the problems that exist outside the Duke healthcare system in the community of Durham.Working at urgent care showed me a different side of this city. It revealed a Durham that many students never encounter — a Durham that walks into the clinic late in the day, often without an insurance card, without a regular doctor and sometimes without even enough money to cover a co-pay — only to be led back out the door because the cost of care is too high.This community doesn’t arrive with carefully researched symptom logs or a curated list of specialists. It comes after weeks, sometimes months, of putting off care — not out of negligence, but necessity. When you are working a job with no paid time off, choosing between missing a paycheck or sitting in a waiting room isn’t a real choice. Oftentimes, this even drove patients out the room due to the wait, sometimes piling at 15-plus patients in the small waiting area with two medical assistants and one physician assistant to help.You may think to yourself: How scary can this get?I remember one patient who came in complaining of chest pain. At urgent care, we don’t provide advanced cardiac care or have the equipment for comprehensive diagnostics. Cases like this require immediate escalation. Whenever we see symptoms that could indicate something life-threatening, we have to act fast because we cannot risk delaying treatment due to the inability to perform full cardiac evaluations on-site. We referred him to the hospital immediately. The next day, we found out he had suffered a massive heart attack — and had narrowly survived.He’d never even known he had heart disease. What happened if he just ignored his symptoms, or downplayed the severity to himself? What shook me most was realizing how limited our resources were in the face of a true emergency. He came to us in crisis, and all we could do was rush him out the door and hope he made it to a place with the tools to save his life. We couldn’t treat him — we could only triage and transfer. That moment stayed with me as a stark reminder of the gaps in our system and how vulnerable patients are when they fall through them. To patients like this one, urgent care was the more convenient and affordable means to potentially detect at the least what may be wrong with them. But — it was indeed a medical emergency that we could not assist them with.Then, my mind flashes back to a young woman who came in with what she described as mild chest discomfort — nothing severe, just a dull ache that had been lingering for a few weeks. Under different circumstances, this might have been caught months earlier during a routine physical or annual check-up. But for her, this wasn’t a routine visit. She had no regular access to preventive care.We did what we could — ordered an X-ray, took her vitals and referred her to a specialist. The next day, we got the results. She had a tumor in her lung. She was diagnosed with lung cancer.I still think about her — how something as routine as regular screenings might have led to an earlier diagnosis, before the discomfort, before the tumor had grown large enough to cause symptoms. Or how more access to health education might have helped her recognize the warning signs sooner and understand when symptoms begin to interfere with daily life and warrant medical attention. But by the time she walked through our doors, her disease had already progressed. Her visit wasn’t preventive; it was reactive. She came in hoping for reassurance, left with a referral, and soon after, received a life-altering diagnosis.It was a heartbreaking reminder that the absence of primary care isn't just an inconvenience — it can be a matter of life and death. When basic, consistent healthcare isn’t accessible, early warning signs get missed. And too often, by the time care is finally received, it’s already too late.Stories like these weren’t rare. They were a reminder that behind every patient file was a life shaped by systemic barriers: financial insecurity, language differences and many more to name.Patients often ask if there’s a cheaper medication before they ask if it even works. Some don’t have a primary care physician at all. Others come in with nothing in their wallets, hoping to be seen without paying a dime.At Duke, we’re taught to think in terms of innovation — precision medicine, novel diagnostics, the next protein breakthrough in a research lab. We talk about specialties, sub-specialties, units and fellowships. We pipette in specialized labs or code algorithms to predict patient outcomes. But outside the institutional ecosystem of Duke Health, I’ve witnessed medicine as damage control — because when preventative care is out of reach, emergencies become the default. Pain becomes a signal to help, not just a symptom.There’s a myth we often carry at Duke — that Durham is lucky to have us. That our presence here inherently uplifts the community. Many pre-med students volunteer within Duke Health — shadowing in specialized clinics, supporting research studies and assisting in hospitals with limitless resources. But if you’re part of the smaller group of students who step outside that ecosystem, you see the truth: The benefit is not evenly distributed.This isn’t about guilt-tripping Duke students. It’s about perspective. Many of us will go on to become doctors, researchers or policymakers. Many of us come from communities where healthcare was accessible and reliable — where a check-up was routine, not a financial risk.So if you want to understand healthcare — really understand it — I urge you to step outside the bubble. Work in a clinic without a Duke logo. Talk to patients who don’t know what MyChart is. Engage in policy research about healthcare in Durham, and how we as a society can improve patient outcomes.It’s in those spaces — not the conference halls — where you see the real work medicine demands. You learn about the disparities that exist and the holes that need to be filled in the future. Durham is not one place, and it’s not easily divided in two. It’s a city of complexity — of resilience and inequity, of innovation and unmet need. But if we want to become the kind of healthcare leaders this country truly needs, we have to be willing to see the disparities in access that shape the lives of the people around us — and act on them.Especially at a predominantly privileged university like Duke, we need to take the initiative to learn what exists beyond the campus gates. Many students go about their lives with preconceptions and expectations about healthcare, education and justice — shaped not by personal experience, but by the environments they were born into. For some, these views are inherited passively — from parents, from affluent communities, from the kind of access and stability that make inequality feel distant or abstract. It’s easy to mistake opportunity for merit, or to view systems as fair simply because they’ve always worked in your favor.Too often, students rely on the privilege their families provide without ever being asked to interrogate the realities that lie outside those networks of wealth, education and influence. Their understanding of the world — and of the issues they may one day be tasked with solving — is filtered through inherited perspectives rather than grounded in lived experience. But privilege should not insulate us from reality; it should compel us to engage with it more deeply.As future doctors, lawyers, researchers and educators, we must be willing to learn not just from data, but from direct experience. We need to step into the clinics, the classrooms and the courtrooms where inequity plays out in real time. We must learn from within the communities we hope to serve — listen to their stories, witness their barriers and understand their needs — if we want to build systems that are truly just, inclusive and responsive.Because leadership in healthcare — or any field — isn’t just about advancing knowledge. It’s about confronting the structures that leave people behind, and doing the hard, uncomfortable work of changing them.Kareena Sukhnanan is a Trinity junior.

"Someone, please teach me JOMO",Annie Ming Kowalik,2025-04-16T10:00:00Z,Apr,16,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/someone-teach-me-jomo-20250416.html,"I have a confession. Well, if you know me personally, it’s not so much a confession as a general observation. I don’t know how to rest. Not really. Not in the way that feels replenishing, intentional or content. I know how to collapse at the end of a long day, sure, crawling into bed at 2 a.m. with a wary mind cast forward to my 8:30. I know how to scroll endlessly on my phone after meetings, classes, lunches, deadlines. But the Joy of Missing Out (JOMO)? That quiet confidence of saying “no” and actually meaning it, even relishing it? That’s still a foreign language to me. At Duke — and also more broadly, within what I’ll call ‘elite’ American culture — the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is a badge of honor. Every conversation seems laced with a hint of competition: who got the internship, who’s flying where this weekend, who’s doing three majors and still leading five clubs. I’m definitely leading part of this culture: I half wanted to drop a little humble brag of my upcoming plans in this very paragraph. It feels a bit like the charge of the light brigade though, ultimately self destructive. You say yes to everything, not because you want to, but because the opportunity might not come again. Psychologists define FOMO as a form of anxiety stemming from the belief that others are having rewarding experiences without you. This anxiety is reinforced in environments where value is measured by output, visibility and breath of activity. The American education system trains you early in this logic. High school students applying to elite colleges, as you all well know, are expected not only to perform well academically but also to demonstrate leadership, social commitment, passion projects and internships — often at once. The message is clear: If you’re not doing everything, you’re doing nothing. You just aren’t as valuable. And so the hustle begins. The constant juggling of research internships, startup ventures, parties — all components of the work hard play hard. I love it so much, this performance of worthiness. I take aesthetic pleasure in every minute of my day being utilized so that my calendar paints an abstract Mondrian with “BAE Systems Sponsorship Call” in blue next to “Tai Chi” in red. Hustle culture, according to recent analysis, often leads to chronic stress and feelings of inadequacy, especially when tied to social media-fueled comparison. As Daniel Markovits argues in his Oxford Union critique of meritocracy, the system ensnares those who succeed at it. He describes meritocracy as a “web of effort, manipulation and self-distortion: that causes even the most privileged to suffer under its demands.” Markovits notes that elite students are subjected to relentless training, tutoring and pressure from an early age, only to graduate into 80-hour workweeks and a constant fear of losing the status they’ve fought so hard to attain. In his words, “you will be extremely wealthy, wealthier than prior elites have been, but you will not be well.” What was once meant to level the playing field has become a mechanism for elite reproduction. We have internalized the belief that achievement must be earned constantly.In my first ever column for the Chronicle, I wrote about how I spent high school in an Australian system that feels like another world. Our university admissions typically hinge on the Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) that is determined by our performance in 12th grade state-wide exams. While this system has its flaws, it also doesn’t expect students to have sent cancer research experiments to space by 18 (I have a friend who’s done this — she’s super cool). If you told someone at an Australian high school that on top of studying for your final exams, you were leading five clubs, playing in an orchestra, leading a robotics team, publishing research, and training for an ironman, they’d probably ask you,“Why?” Or assume you were a bit unwell. That said, the toxic ‘do-it-all’ mentality has started to leak into Australia’s top selective schools too. The global prestige arms race is alive and well, and students are increasingly importing the American logic of hustle. Overall, that level of performance isn’t common or expected in Australia. There’s more cultural room to breathe. You can see this difference with distinction in professional life. American work culture is often framed around maximizing output and minimizing downtime — linked to Protestant work ethic and deeply embedded capitalist ideals. The U.S. ranks relatively low in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCED) measure of work-life balance and high in hours annually, and also reports lower career satisfaction and higher rates of burnout and depression compared to many other high-income countries. Meanwhile, in Australia, there’s a national emphasis on work-life balance. Full-time workers are legally entitled to four weeks of paid annual leave, and taking it is encouraged, not penalized. In 2023, Australia even passed new “Right to Disconnect” laws allowing employees to ignore work communications outside working hours without repercussions. Of course, that’s not always possible, but the contrast in mentality is stark. We Aussies report a higher World Happiness score and lower levels of work-related stress than Americans. My own blindness to this is so severe that my relatively stereotypically “Asian Tiger” mother called me the other day to tell me that she had raised me to seize every opportunity — that I need to find pride, not shame, in skipping the party, the talk, the side hustle. And yet, here I am. Juggling so many metaphorical balls that if someone tried to help me, they’d all crash to the ground. I feel a little bit like a cat that’s fallen into a vat of cream, not sure whether to drink as much as I can or to save myself from drowning in plenty. I know it’s unsustainable. I know the research: chronic overcommitment is linked to anxiety, depression and even cardiovascular issues. The goal is to undercommit and overdeliver, yet a lot of us do the opposite, overcommitting to ultimately underdeliver. I admire those who unplug from the culture of comparison. Who knows how to say no, not because they’re lazy or antisocial, but because they respect themselves enough to rest.Oops — gotta go — I’ve got dinner scheduled.

‘The White Lotus’ Season 4 to be filmed at Washington Duke Inn,Monday Monday,2025-04-16T10:00:00Z,Apr,16,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/white-lotus-film-washington-duke-20250416.html,"Editor's note: The article below is satire.In an unprecedented settlement agreement, HBO has granted Duke full creative control over “The White Lotus” Season 4, following the backlash to a Season 3 scene in which a character was wearing a Duke shirt during a graphic scene. The upcoming season will now be filmed entirely at the Washington Duke Inn, where Duke will oversee casting, storylines, guest activities, and — of course — the murder plot. The season will take place during the week leading up to the Duke vs. UNC men’s basketball game in March 2026. All characters in the resort will be there to attend the game, but anyone who graduated from the University of Houston will be automatically denied housing. Duke’s first major addition was the creation of a new UNC alumni character, let’s call him Herbert, who will endure a week of relentless misfortune. In just seven days, Herbert will lose his job, get divorced by his wife, develop a sudden allergy to his favorite food, all coming after he had to stay at the Washington Duke Inn after his house burned down a few days before. When asked if this character arc was excessive, Duke replied, “Two can play at this game, HBO.”Alongside Herbert will be a rotating cast of guests, including an economist staying at the Inn to interview for an investment position at Duke. He will be described as brilliant but unable to stop talking about how to grow the university’s endowment. Another guest family will consist of four extremely normal midwesterners from southern Illinois who attend the basketball game but spend most of their time golfing and walking the Al Buehler Trail. They are deeply chill — possibly too chill. Hotel staff suspect they are part of a deadly cult but can’t confirm. Guests at the resort will enjoy a wide array of themed activities designed by Duke. One highly anticipated activity includes wading into the pond on the 12th hole to fish out lost golf balls, which can be resold or customized in a guided art class using paint sourced from the Duke Wellness Center. A suggested golf ball logo design includes a QR code to donate to the Duke Annual Fund.Evenings will center around the hotel’s Bull Durham Bar, which becomes a lively social hub for all guests — except Herbert, who continues to get bad news. His courtside Duke-UNC game tickets turned out to be fake, and all other seats are now sold out. The tension builds with other Herbert mishaps throughout the week until the inevitable happens: Herbert’s demise.While Duke expressed no preference for what happened to the other characters, they took great care in planning Herbert’s exit. According to Duke’s official pitch, Herbert — now desperate and unemployed—returns to the 12th hole pond to collect more golf balls to sell on Facebook Marketplace. While knee-deep in water, he’s tackled by one of the southern Illinois cult members and is shoved into the pond. One of the hundreds of golf balls already floating in the water bounces off a rock and ricochets directly into his open mouth. The series ends with the guests driving away from the Washington Duke after another Duke W, all chanting Go To Hell Carolina.Monday Monday would like to inform readers that HBO gladly accepted this plot after Duke agreed to let HBO stream all Duke live sports."
Underwater: The rise and fall of the Marine Lab library,Aaron Siegle,2025-04-15T10:00:00Z,Apr,15,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/rise-and-fall-of-the-marine-lab-library-20250415.html,"“A room without books is like a body without a soul.” — CiceroIf news broke that Duke would be shutting down Perkins Library, the entire campus would be filled with protesting students. After all, the library is the intellectual and social hub of campus, a place where profound ideas are shared and priceless memories are made. I couldn’t imagine Duke without its libraries. As unfathomable as this story may sound, this exact scenario is playing out with little fanfare at the Marine Lab.On Friday, April 4, members of the Duke University Marine Lab (DUML) community received a message that the campus’ library, Pearse Memorial Library, would be closing, effective July 1, 2025. The decision comes as a university looks to cut costs in the face of declining federal funding for research. Funding cuts, in addition to the rise of digitization and a faulty HVAC system, were cited as the primary reasons for the library’s closure. The library has survived much worse — hurricanes, extreme flooding, political turmoil and the rapid urbanization of the marine environment around it. But after serving the Marine Lab community for 50 years, the library is set to be shuttered.The closure of Pearse Memorial Library is a harbinger of more cuts that will occur university-wide. As a part of the University's recent cost-cutting initiative, the “strategic realignment and cost reduction process” will whittle away resources that the University deems non-essential. It’s a sobering reminder that research doesn’t pay for itself: it is sustained by federal grants, philanthropic dollars and support from industry.Universities aren’t designed to be money-making machines. Duke’s mission statement contains some pretty lofty goals — promoting human happiness, curing diseases and advancing the frontiers of knowledge — but making money is not one of them. Yes, I understand that maximizing profits and running a financially solvent institution are two very different things. But that doesn’t mean that research and university services like a library aren’t valuable simply because they aren’t likely to turn a profit.Let’s be honest — marine science doesn’t bring in the big bucks. But even if marine science isn’t a profit-maximizing field, I believe that the Marine Lab is one of the most valuable units of the University. Marine science is a young field — we know less about the ocean floor than we do about the surface of Mars. But much of what we do know about the seafloor is thanks to Dr. Cindy Lee Van Dover, a world-renowned oceanographer and former Marine Lab director. And Dr. Van Dover is just one of many examples of faculty at DUML advancing the frontiers of knowledge about a part of our Earth that we know little about.Yes, the Marine Lab may be important, but why does it need a library?After all, the email announcing the library’s closure promised that “no interruption or reductionin the essential library services and resources” would occur. If that’s the case, then why oppose the closure of the physical library space?The answer lies in the two populations that benefit the most from the library, undergraduate students and the surrounding communities in Carteret County.The Duke Marine Lab distinguishes itself from larger marine research institutions, such as the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute or the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, in that it is a highly accessible space for undergraduate research. Unlike in Durham, where most undergrad research experiences involve performing repetitive tasks in a 40-person lab, the Marine Lab allows undergrads to take control of their own research. When I was at the Marine Lab, I had the opportunity to design two of my own research projects from start to finish — which is unheard of back in Durham. But this is the norm at the Marine Lab. In some cases, undergrads can even use the research vessel R/V Shearwater to conduct research.The library is a core component of this research experience. There’s a myth that the Marine Lab library is never used because “kids these days don’t read anymore.” That couldn’t be further from the truth. Students at the Marine Lab read books from the library frequently because the Pearse Memorial Library has an exemplary selection of titles focused on marine science and policy. Some of my favorite titles I have checked out include ""The Quiet Crisis"" by Stewart Udall and ""The History of Down East,"" which tells the story of rural fishing communities near the Marine Lab. Both books have deeply impacted my conceptions of the environment and the way humans interact with it. You can call me an old man — but there is a special feeling, an intangible yet profound notion, that you feel when opening up a physical book. A book’s prickly pages or musty smell can add more value to a story than the words themselves. The experience of reading a hard-copy book cannot be replicated by scrolling through a monotonous 452-page PDF on your laptop. Furthermore, many titles housed at the Marine Lab library are out of print and don’t have digital counterparts. As such, replacing Pearse Memorial Library with a digital library is wholly insufficient.Surrounding communities in Carteret County will also suffer if the library closes. The Marine Lab does an excellent job of connecting with the local community through programs such as the Community Science Initiative and the DukeEngage Community Outreach program. These programs, in addition to the Marine Lab’s open house, provide opportunities for community members to explore the library and learn more about marine science. Since the Duke library system is open to non-Duke-affiliated persons, the library serves as a repository of knowledge for the community.While this may seem insignificant to us, it’s important to remember that 30% of residents in Carteret County are considered low-income. The local public library is modest. The Marine Lab library is a place where young kids from the area cultivate an appreciation for the environment, a sentiment that will pay dividends for decades to come. A digital library will not reap the same benefits.The real reason why the Marine Lab library is closing has nothing to do with “evolving and enhancing Duke’s library services” — it’s all about the money. The existence of the Marine Lab has always frazzled the accounting team back in Durham because it’s relatively costly for its small size and generates little revenue. But if you look beyond the balance sheet, you will find the most impactful and irreplaceable unit at Duke.The University knows this too. That’s why the Marine Lab is featured prominently in promotions for the Duke Climate Commitment and the “Made for This” fundraising campaign. Duke donors want solutions to climate change, and the Marine Lab is well equipped to provide them.But climate solutions don’t appear out of thin air — they are built upon a knowledge base. That knowledge base is Pearse Memorial Library. It’s a storehouse of wisdom that can’t be replaced by a glitchy university library website, difficult-to-navigate-PDFs and journal articles stuck behind paywalls. Saving the library is integral to unlocking the Marine Lab’s potential as a climate changemaker.Aaron Seigle is a Trinity junior. His pieces typically run on alternate Fridays."
Not an easy road,Luke A. Powery,2025-04-14T17:00:00Z,Apr,14,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/not-an-easy-road-20250414.html,"Over the last several weeks, I have returned to a reggae song I had on repeat during the COVID pandemic: “Not an Easy Road” by the artist Buju Banton. There is an original version of this song and a remix acoustical version. The musical arrangements are very different, but the same lyrics in both hit home for me these days.“From the minute of birth you enter this earthObstacles in your way to overcome firstThroughout every day they seem to get worseOh my God cast away this curseEverybody is trying to make ends meet…It’s not an easy road.” It’s not an easy road, whether you’re thinking of losing loved ones or losing jobs or losing money in the stock market or losing your mind over global wars. It’s not an easy road, no matter who you are or where you come from. You can ponder the global, national, or local realities and should still come to the same honest conclusion — it’s not an easy road. I’m not trying to depress you. I’m trying to be honest with you, whether you’re 20 years old or 60 years old. I know it may be bad enough that you’re slammed with final exams or projects near the end of the semester, and you may not want to hear this message right about now. But it’s the truth and nothing but the truth. Relinquish the lie that life is always luscious.Poetic fragments speak to this rough road. Langston Hughes wrote, “Life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.” Warsan Shire wrote,“i held an atlas in my lapran my fingers across the whole worldand whisperedwhere does it hurt?it answeredeverywhereeverywhereeverywhere”Pauli Murray wrote, “I have been enslaved, yet my spirit is unbound. I have been cast aside, but I sparkle in the darkness. I have been slain but live on in the rivers of history.” These poetic lines are like icons of the real presence of pain. The honesty of poetry captures the reality of human struggle. Phrases from hymns echo this too: “Through many dangers, toils, and snares, I have already come.” “I’m climbing up the rough side of the mountain.” “When I tread the verge of Jordan,Bid my anxious fears subside…”For Christians, this week, known as Holy Week, is not an easy road either; it follows Jesus to his execution on a cross. It is a reminder that life leads to death and sometimes at the hands of so-called friends. It makes me want to say what Kendrick Lamar does in his Pulitzer-prize-winning album: “DAMN.” That’s what the rough road may cause you, or even buttoned-up preachers, to say from time to time.As this semester ends, and especially for those who are graduating from Duke, the question is: What resources will you carry with you on this road? How will you maintain and gain inner strength (what retired Duke professor Craig Dykstra called “soul capacity”) to walk this road? How will you fatten your spirit while living in leaner material times? What will you say, play, or pray?The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is known for his civil rights work but so often his spiritual grounding is forgotten or ignored. He knew it wasn’t an easy road, and it took a toll on him as it would any of us. In January 1956, amid the disequilibrium of the Montgomery bus boycott, King received a threatening phone call late one night. He went to his kitchen to make coffee, trying to think of how he could gracefully withdraw from the boycott. And then, he recounted:“In this state of exhaustion, when my courage had all but gone, I decided to take my problem to God. With my head in my hands, I bowed over the kitchen table and prayed aloud … At that moment I experienced the presence of the Divine as I had never experienced Him before. It seemed as though I could hear the quiet assurance of an inner voice, saying: ‘Stand up for righteousness, stand up for truth; and God will be at your side forever.’”King’s deepened relationship with God had a profound effect on him. Three nights later, when his home was bombed and his family narrowly escaped injury, he said, “Strangely enough, I accepted the word of the bombing calmly. My religious experience a few nights before had given me the strength to face it.” I don’t want to be a downer as the academic year closes, but I want you to hear the truth and not fake news. Life isn’t an easy road; it never has been or will be. How will you walk it? What will sustain you as you walk forward? What are your interior resources? What will be your “kitchen table?”The Rev.

‘Cowardice as policy’: Duke’s obligation to resist,Adam Levin,2025-04-14T10:00:00Z,Apr,14,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/cowardice-as-policy-20250414.html,"In 1967, the University of Chicago produced the Kalven Report. In it, Harry Kalven, a legal scholar, argued for the virtues of institutional neutrality — meaning almost absolute abstention from any social or political issues. Universities across the country have since used this policy to prevent weighing in on any number of issues, and recently, it’s taken the forefront as protestors have demanded that administrators divest from Israel. Now, universities, terrified of saying or doing the wrong thing, appear to have embraced the same approach regarding President Donald Trump’s executive orders. And although Duke doesn’t have an official policy of institutional neutrality, it has so far followed Kalven’s tenets when it comes to both the ongoing aspects of the Israel-Gaza conflict and the current Trump administration’s decisions — which have proposed significant National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding cuts, nearly eliminated the Department of Education and targeted schools with Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs. For example, Duke posted a graphic decrying the impact of scientific funding cuts on the university … without mentioning who enacted these cuts in the first place. Similarly, Duke has yet to release any statement defending their DEI policy or confirming that it will continue to exist, instead choosing to remain silent.But even in the report that universities have consistently cited to avoid taking any stances that could be deemed partisan, it explains, “instances will arise in which the society ... threaten the very mission of the university and its values of free inquiry. In such a crisis, it becomes the obligation of the university as an institution to oppose such measures and actively to defend its interests and its values.”The current Trump funding cuts threaten Duke’s physical capacity and funding, yes, but they also threaten the national system of higher education that Duke has an institutional mission to defend. In his article titled “The End of College Life,” Ian Bogost, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, explains that hiring freezes can decrease course options. Funding cuts have affected construction projects, sports programs, study-abroad — and humanities departments will be next to go. Additionally, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)’s so-called quest for efficiency has left the stripped-down personnel carrying out financial aid allocation overworked and overloaded. As a result, Bogost concludes that Trump’s attacks on higher education “could upend the college experience for millions of Americans.”It might be easy to mentally diminish the impact of these cuts. Yes, these actions are likely not an existential threat to universities like Duke, with an endowment of over 12 billion (although the vast majority of those funds are earmarked), but they are to small, regional colleges that are often the primary economic driver of their communities. There are 500 of these universities across the United States, serving 5 million students, and many of them are already in budget deficits, with no cushion to fall back on. Duke, as a well-resourced university, has an obligation to prevent Trump’s threats to the higher education system, before it’s too late. What can Duke do, then, without making itself a target for massive cuts and possibly endangering its students? First, I think it’s not a question of if, but when. Eventually, the federal government will come for Duke — it will come for its DEI programs, its research funding and the academic freedom of its humanities. No silence will save an elite university like Duke, especially since we are already under federal investigation. Second, there is no clear correlation between speaking up and having federal funds pulled: for example, Wesleyan, which has had by far the most outspoken president against the cuts, has yet to experience any federal funding impact. Third, and most importantly, funding cuts are not necessarily permanent, simply because funding cuts are not legal. Already, judges have issued 46 temporary injunctions against Trump’s executive orders, granting preliminary relief almost 70% of the time. On April 4, a judge permanently blocked billions in NIH funding cuts to universities and medical centers. None of this is certain — these cases might lose on appeal. However, universities like Columbia have incredibly strong standing to sue, mainly because the federal government completely circumvented a lengthy legal process in stripping their funding. The earlier we capitulate and appease Trump’s demands, the worse the problem will get. Columbia’s Middle Eastern studies department has already lost its independence, and nationally, some professors are “pre-emptively censoring themselves”. But there are options for Duke to resist. Both the presidents of Princeton and Wesleyan have written op-eds rejecting Trump’s anti-intellectual demands. The president of Wesleyan, Michael Roth, is preemptively preparing to fight back by considering the development of a legal defense fund with Yale. Outside of higher education, the public schools of New York State publicly refused to comply with Trump’s demands to end DEI policies. And the more institutions that speak out, especially privileged, elite institutions, the more that will follow. We shouldn’t doubt the collective power of the thousands of universities across the country — their taking action would certainly impact public opinion and serve as a major legal obstacle to Trump’s cultural and political goals. And even if none of this has convinced you, if you still believe that any individual public speech by universities is too large a risk, backroom options remain. As Todd Wolfson of the American Association of University Professors argued, there is “no reason why we haven’t seen a letter signed by 1,000 presidents.”So it’s inexcusable that Duke has remained silent. Our neutrality is, as Roth explained, making “cowardice into a policy,” and it is not worth the future of higher education. And more so, our neutrality helps no one. It doesn’t help the system of free speech in academia or the regional universities that rely on government funding. Eventually, it will not help us. Because historically, national descents into fascism have not been marked by a single event, but by a pattern of appeasements and capitulations by institutions built to resist.

Second, I feel “overwhelmed, especially with an excess of something.” That excess is usually work, but it doesn’t have to be. This weekend, I’m overwhelmed with RA duties and dental appointments. There’s a third thing too. “Swamped” gives “swamp,” gives a boggy area filled with mud and low-lying plants. Gives watch out for alligators. Gives once you fall in, you’ll never get out.Is that my fate? Our fate? That’s the sad but comforting thing: Here at Duke, none of us are alone in this. My friend and I were waiting for class to start one day, when he opened his calendar. It took a minute for my eyes to adjust — it looked like a Tetris game seconds away from game over. I opened up my own calendar to compare. The first thing I felt was shame: Next to his, my week looked naked. Then, relief. After this class, my friend had a meeting in French Science and an event in Sanford to attend, while my afternoon would be free. Not free in the sense that I didn’t have work to do — God no. But free in the sense that I could choose which assignment to tackle first and which second. Free in the sense that if I got hungry, I could go to WU and get dinner. If I got sleepy, I could retreat to Bell Tower and call it a night. Free in the sense that none of this was on my calendar — I could steer my afternoon whichever way I wanted to.There are two types of people: those who put only the mandatory and out-of-the-ordinary on their calendars (meetings and appointments) and those who leave nothing out. They know exactly what’s coming up: from classes, to study breaks, to gym sessions, to meals, to moon cycles. They Tetris their schedule down to the very minute.(There’s a third kind of person who claims to be able to remember everything and puts nothing on their calendar. I don’t know if there ever was such a type at Duke. If so, this specimen has since gone extinct.)I’m of the former category. I like my weeks to feel a little breezy — at least on paper. My to-do list is dense, but not rigorous. I give myself some calendar reminders — upcoming Econ midterms and mandatory RA training. But I also give myself the space to take longer than 30 minutes to have breakfast if I feel like it one day.I never thought about why until this week. First, I try to avoid futile work. Inputting a couple more tasks on my calendar would not take a lot of effort — but it doesn’t serve me. Take ten minutes to input tasks every day, and that’s 70 minutes by the end of the week. Four and a half hours by the end of the month. There are better things I can do with that time.Second, I find full calendars visually overwhelming. Which tasks are urgent? Which are just fillers? Why is your physics midterm the same color as that Theta Chi party next Friday? By noting only unusual and/or important tasks on my calendar, each stands out. The rest is routine — fades in the background.This affords me flexibility. I get to grasp opportunities as they come. Because it’s hard to guess correctly how long things are going to take. There are a lot of variables that go into how your day pans out. You never know when your friends are going to text you at peak dinner time, “table near JBs,” or when your professor is going to start a discussion thread on Canvas — posts due at midnight. And the reverse is true as well. You never know when your class is going to let out early or get cancelled because of a hurricane warning. You never know when it’s going to take you only one hour to write your Chronicle article as opposed to the usual two.You’ll learn some things about yourself: If you find yourself with a spare hour, will you use it well, even if you have nothing planned? If something takes longer than expected, will it wreck the rest of your plans? You should learn to be flexible not only physically but also mentally. If you find it stressful when your minutely planned day doesn’t turn out exactly the way you intended it to, that might be something to work on. Not in a bad way — it’s not your fault. Assigning every minute a productive task is simply unreasonable. Even good days, where you achieved 80% of what you’d set out to do, start to feel like failures.Yet, Duke students have an urge to fill up their time with all sorts of activities. As soon as a sliver of a half hour opens up, they rush to fill it. Instead, let’s start cherishing the little time we have.I won’t ask you to “take it easy” — that’s not really an option. I know you can’t afford it. But maybe, take it easier. Just because everyone around you is on a tight schedule — a hamster on a wheel — doesn’t mean that’s normal or okay.Last month, I wrote about some favors I try to do for my future self. This is one more. I grant myself the luxury of a little breathing room.If you’re the type to leave zero white space in your calendar, I'll ask you one more thing: How much does your schedule dictate your relationships? By filling up your day with tasks, you risk squeezing friendships out.Because even Tetris masters can’t keep playing forever. This game is exhausting. Inevitably, some pieces will slip through the cracks. I can’t help but wonder if I’ll be one of those pieces.If I call you in the middle of the day, will you answer? If I get stuck in an invisible swamp, will you have time to come fish me out? We’re hanging out one day, and you get an alert that it’s time to go back to studying. Will you still walk me home?Anna Garziera is a Trinity sophomore. Her pieces typically run on alternate Sundays."
The Blue Devils who stole my daughter's heart,Jimmy Soni,2025-04-11T10:00:00Z,Apr,11,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/blue-devils-stole-my-daughters-heart-20250411.html,"There are moments in parenting when the universe conspires in your favor. When something you love, something that has been a part of the architecture of your own life, suddenly becomes alive in the heart of your child. This year, I experienced such a gift with my nine-year-old daughter and Duke basketball.I didn't plan it. Children today have their own digital worlds, their own cultural touchstones that often leave parents puzzled at the periphery. I introduced her to the team and the sport casually, with no expectations — a Duke alum father's nostalgic offering, nothing more. What bloomed from that casual introduction became one of the sweetest surprises of my parenting journey.My daughter transformed into what can only be described as a rabid Duke fan. She created nicknames for Cooper Flagg (""Coop"") and Tyrese Proctor (""Protector""). She learned three-point percentages and explained foul trouble with the gravity of a seasoned commentator. She developed opinions — strong ones — about Jon Scheyer's coaching decisions. When Duke played, the rest of the world ceased to exist for her.What made this particularly poignant was the timing. Duke had a historic season — a 35-3 record and a Final Four appearance. As a Duke alum, I recognized this as extraordinary. But to my daughter, this excellence was simply what basketball is. It was like introducing someone to ice cream by starting them with the finest gelato in Florence.She was thoroughly spoiled. I didn't have the heart to explain that most seasons don't unfold like this one, that most teams don't have the likes of Flagg performing basketball miracles on a weekly basis.We made the pilgrimage to New York's Madison Square Garden for a game this season. In the cathedral of basketball, she experienced the peculiar alchemy that happens in that space — the way the crowd noise reverberates, the electric anticipation before tip-off. When her face appeared on the jumbotron, the look of pure delight that washed over her was worth every penny of those astronomical ticket prices.What struck me most about our shared fandom was its purity. In an age where sports are increasingly entangled with betting odds, controversies and the darker elements of human nature, my daughter's love for Duke basketball existed in a realm of uncomplicated joy. She didn't care about point spreads or NIL deals or transfer portal drama. She cared about Khaman Maluach's slam dunks and whether Kon Knueppel would hit his next three-pointer.There is something redemptive about experiencing sports through a child's eyes. It strips away the cynicism and transports us back to what drew us to the games in the first place — the simple thrill of watching extraordinary human achievement, the emotional investment in a team's journey, the communal experience of cheering alongside thousands of strangers who, for those few hours, feel like family.Then came the Final Four loss.Her disappointment was real, and for a fleeting moment, I questioned the wisdom of introducing her to this exquisite heartache that all true fans eventually know. But watching her process the defeat with such genuine care, I saw the gift hidden within the disappointment: Valleys make mountains tall. The sting of loss makes the sweetness of victory worth savoring.Duke's journey ended short of a championship, but what they delivered transcends any trophy — they forged a bridge between a father and daughter, a shared vocabulary of moments and heroes, a common sanctuary in an otherwise divided world. While the stats and scores will fade into basketball archives, this connection will endure.In their graceful defeat, the Blue Devils also taught my daughter what no victory ever could — that devotion means standing firm when the confetti falls for someone else, that some commitments survive disappointment, that caring deeply is its own reward. Through Scheyer's composed sideline presence and his players' dignified exit, she witnessed how to honor both the game and yourself when dreams slip away.For that lesson — more valuable than any championship banner — I offer my quiet gratitude to Duke basketball, the institution that cultivated not just extraordinary athletes but, unknowingly, a nine-year-old girl's beautiful introduction to loving something larger than herself.Jimmy Soni, Trinity '07, is an author, most recently of ""When the Light Finds Us.""

Every major is a climate major,Aaron Siegle,2025-04-10T10:00:00Z,Apr,10,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/every-major-climate-major-20250410.html,"“For every major, this major,” is Duke’s tagline to promote its offering of climate and sustainability courses. Despite climate-related courses ranging from economics to theater, many students ask, “why should I care?” At an institution where many students are already pursuing an ambitious course load, there is little room for exploration.It’s apparent that Duke is a pre-professional university. Most students take a career-first approach in designing their education, the majority of students enter into a select few industries after they graduate. Per the Career Center’s 2023 Senior Outcomes report, 57% of seniors who entered the workforce were employed in just four industries (finance, consulting, tech and healthcare). Much ink has been spilled on how pre-professionalism affects Duke culture, so I’ll leave this discussion for another day. Regardless, these trends seem to indicate that there is little room for Duke students to engage with climate issues in their professional lives.Many people care about protecting the environment but often see it as secondary to pursuing their career goals. But this is a false dichotomy. As the impacts of climate change increase, employers are looking for candidates who can solve environmental challenges. Going green is no longer seen as just a moral imperative, but rather an existential threat to business that must be mitigated.Still, it can be tough to find intersections between a certain industry and sustainability. Below are Duke’s five main pre-professional paths and how students pursuing one of these paths can make a positive climate impact in their career:1.Software EngineeringThe climate impact of AI is hotly debated. While the electricity needed to power data centers is likely to result in a (hopefully) short-term spike in emissions, AI can enable deep decarbonization by promoting energy-efficiency. Precision energy management, smart agriculture and supply chain optimization are just a few examples of how AI can reduce emissions by streamlining industrial processes.From a career standpoint, software engineers are needed to build algorithms that enable energy-efficiency. For example, Cirrus Nexus, a New York based IT firm, developed software that reduced data center carbon emissions by 34% via optimizing server workload scheduling. Big tech companies such as Google, Meta and AWS are the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy globally and have dedicated energy teams to manage these transactions.2.ConsultingWhile many view sustainability consulting as merely a form of greenwashing, the sector is growing as companies now must comply with climate regulations. The EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and California’s climate disclosure regulations will increase demand for consultants who can mitigate climate risk and track greenhouse gas emissions.Consulting firms are taking notice and growing their sustainability teams. BCG’s Climate and Sustainability team, McKinsey Sustainability and Bain Sustainability assist companies with meeting their decarbonization and energy transition goals. These big firms compete for deals with climate specialist firms such as Coho Climate Advisors, E3 and Watershed.3.Finance$1.8 trillion was invested in the energy transition in 2023, a record high. In 2023, 1.7 times more capital was invested into renewable energy than fossil fuels. This financial support for renewable energy was primarily due to cost and energy security reasons, not sustainability concerns. These strong fundamentals mean that clean energy investing is here to stay.Though major financial firms may be downplaying their investments in renewable energy for political reasons, they are still very much involved in the sector. Brookfield, a prominent alternative asset manager, has over 46,000 megawatts of renewable energy generation (enough to power roughly 3.2 million homes) and recently raised $10 billion for its latest energy transition fund. Other segments of the financial services industry, such as private equity, investment banks, venture capital and project finance, are also heavily involved in financing the energy transition. Private equity firms and investment banks tend to focus on already established industries such as wind and solar while venture capitalists take more risky bets on nascent technologies such as white hydrogen and nuclear fusion. 4.Pre-MedClimate change is accelerating the spread of diseases by expanding the range of prominent disease vectors, such as mosquitos and ticks. As a result, tropical diseases will become more common in temperate zones. Extreme heat waves induced by climate change are increasing the number of heat-related deaths and illnesses. Poor air quality is a major culprit of many respiratory diseases.A new generation of doctors who are knowledgeable of climate threats and their impact on human health will be needed. At Duke, the School of Medicine recently received funding to study the impacts of climate change on health. The Scholars in Marine Medicine program enables undergrads to conduct research at the nexus of oceans and human health. Many opportunities exist to help the human body adapt to the stresses of climate change.5.Pre-LawLawyers will be needed to advance climate policy and promote environmental justice goals. Major climate legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act on the federal level and HB951 in North Carolina were made possible by lawyers who painstakingly crafted the appropriate provisions to hold together fractured coalitions. Across the country at public utility commissions, lawyers are advocating for grid optimization and renewable energy integration policies, which will be key in reducing emissions. Attorneys focused on environmental justice hold polluting industries accountable while also combatting false climate solutions such as wood pellets.While public sector openings in this space are limited, many other avenues are available to practice climate law. Public advocacy groups, such as Earthjustice, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Southern Environmental Law Center frequently hire attorneys. International climate agreements such as those negotiated yearly at the UNFCCC’s COP conferences require lawyers to hash out the details. Other climate and environmental law pathways include land use law, pollution control, energy law, food law and water law.Even if Duke students aren’t comfortable with deviating from their preferred career path, they can still have a positive impact on climate issues. Progress in all the sectors mentioned here will be required if we are to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. A profession is just a means to an end. The good thing is that you can choose that end. Aaron Seigle is a Trinity junior. His pieces typically run on alternate Fridays."
"Independence, community or both",Lisa Maria Stirbu,2025-04-09T10:00:00Z,Apr,9,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/independence-community-both-20250409.html,"When I spontaneously decided during my second semester of third-year to study abroad, the idea of going to the U.S. felt like a far-fetched dream. Living on campus, attending college football games and experiencing the infamous frat parties seemed like something I could only experience through “Legally Blonde.”But what if the American college dream, the epitome of a European student´s fantasy, shaped by movie clichés and campus stereotypes, was what awaited me on the other side of the world? When I got admitted to Duke, I knew I was about to find out.Upon my initial arrival, I was greeted with one of the most breathtaking sights I could have ever imagined for a college campus. The vast stretches of green, the towering and charming Gothic architecture of West Campus and countless stadiums for all kinds of sports left me in astonishment wherever I chose to look. My first months were particularly filled with awe, unable to believe what was about to be my new reality for the next year. Am I really that lucky?My personal Roman Empire in the first week of class was my corporate finance professor asking me where I was from. When I responded that I came from the Free University of Berlin (FU), he looked at me in surprise and asked why I would leave such a prestigious university for Duke. I was quite shocked and honestly in disbelief hearing that statement when I realised he wasn't joking. I was absolutely falling in love with Duke more and more day by day — the vibrant Duke culture, the incredible orientation week I had just experienced and most of all, the people.Academically speaking, the gap between Duke and FU couldn’t have been bigger. In Germany, students apply directly to a major and are thus much more limited in the courses they can take outside their field of study. Here, I suddenly had the flexibility to explore minors, certificates and a variety of electives beyond my major. I am currently taking U.S. Arts Policy, which couldn’t be further from my business major at home. I also absolutely love that, in contrast to my home university, I didn’t have just one highly theoretical final that would determine my grade for a class. At home, I would be stressed out to study each time, even though straight A’s are more of an exception for German students. Instead, Duke greeted me with a mix of midterms, quizzes, presentations and participation that would flow into my grade, which made my day busier, but my finals less stressful.The only thing I truly started to miss was our voluntary attendance for every lecture and discussion-based classes (if they even existed). I mean, why was I supposed to show up for classes and why did teachers take attendance? I felt like I was in high school again. The concept of FLUNCHing professors, sending them a quick WhatsApp when you run late for class or being invited to their home for a party was one of the biggest culture shocks I had. Are you trying to tell me that your professor talks to you about anything but your grade, and you have their number and socials saved in your contacts?Beyond having to worry much less about my grades and having the most amazing professors, I was amazed by Duke’s incredible sense of community. At Duke, living on campus all of a sudden meant fully immersing myself in student life, something I had never gotten to experience before. College sports, particularly basketball and football, were more than just games, they were part of Duke’s culture, and you were Duke’s culture. Writing a test to answer Neal Begovitch’s prom date dress’s color just to get into Black Tenting for Duke basketball while competing against over 2,000 other students and being lucky to tent for three weeks (nominal—realistically much less due to the freezing weather) is a very niche experience that I was able to experience here. But it didn't just stop here, no. Writing even another test, decorating tents with the craziest names related to the players like The Konstitutionor The Ten Khamandments to get a good spot in Cameron, just for game day to be rocked by students dressed in groups in terms of their tents, this was just a culture you wouldn’t get in Berlin. As a matter of fact, you wouldn’t get this anywhere. Now let me take you to the other side of the Atlantic — no school colors, no mascots, no chants. Just the city. Let me immerse you in what I was used to before Duke, in a version of college that breathes spontaneity, thrives on independence, and lives outside campus gates.Being a student in Berlin means spending an hour and a half on public transport just to attend a two-hour lecture before heading right back home because you don’t have anything else to do at university. It means deciding on a whim to go to Berghain on a Thursday night because, honestly, no one is checking attendance the next morning, or the morning after if you're really in party mode. It’s dropping into the library to see if your friends are studying, debating whether to join them or head home to tend to everything else but studying. Or maybe taking a detour to a café in Mitte instead, visiting Hugendubel to roam the halls for hours because you’re currently looking for your newest read. It’s working part-time as a barista, at a consulting company, or remotely, because most students balance jobs alongside their studies or even work full-time. It’s engaging in student clubs on a much smaller scale, perhaps visiting companies after class for networking events if you are in such a club, and sometimes accidentally stumbling into an environmental protest or an open-air party at Warschauer Straße metro station on your way home, and sometimes staying just because.Berlin hands you art on a silver platter. Museum Island, underground exhibits and a thriving cultural scene become part of your daily life when you're not in university, which you mostly are not. The city offers endless creative spaces, from abandoned airports like Flughafen Schönefeld, to hidden clubs where DJs play until noon the next day, which are places you randomly find out about on your way back from university. And if you ever need to escape this bustling city, you can hop on a 14-euro flight and find yourself in another European city for the weekend, or weeks or months, and return just in time for exams — because, in Berlin, university is more of an occasional fling, while at Duke, it’s a long term relationship.Berlin also gives you the perfect space for ventures. In the evening, you might go back to university as your school is hosting a game night where all your major’s students play Mario Kart, sing karaoke, and play beer pong in your hallway — just remember to show up to your classes tomorrow. Or not — no one cares. In the mornings before lectures, you can join a running club and grab breakfast immediately after in Kreuzberg from one of the dozens of amazing restaurants - Turkish, Arabic, Italian, Nigerian — you name it, Berlin has it. Berlin is when your tedious morning metro ride to class is accompanied by a live band that you wish would’ve jumped into another wagon, or a super obsessed calisthenics guy showing off his newly learned skills, or unfortunately both at the same time. Berlin is when you go to Schöneberger Bierstube or Schwarzes Café and somehow run into half your university. Berlin is doing nothing all semester and then, two weeks before exams, deciding to cram like your life depends on it, because you only have one grade for the class, and the class average is probably a C-.But you get it. And Berlin gets it. And Berlin gets you. Berlin welcomes everyone, and I believe the liberty to do anything and everything is what makes Berlin irresistible.At its core, Berlin is spontaneous. It’s independent. It’s free.Duke, on the other hand, is structured. It’s immersive. It’s a tightly-knit community.Berlin is where you carve your path, where freedom pulses through the city and independence is your compass, it is a place that challenges you to write your own story. Duke, on the other hand, is a force that sweeps you up, a community where every moment feels connected, where the campus and its people become the heartbeat of your own experience. Here, togetherness is the rhythm, and it’s impossible not to be swept into the flow.Experiencing both cities and universities has made me realize that neither is inherently better or worse; they both simply offer different kinds of growth. And fortunately, between those two extremes, I have found myself.Lisa Maria Stirbu is a Trinity junior on exchange from Berlin."
"When speech feels risky, speak anyway",Noor Nazir,2025-04-08T10:00:00Z,Apr,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/when-speech-feels-risky-speak-anyway-20250408.html,"I opened this document weeks ago. Typed two sentences. Deleted one.Scrolled through Mahmoud Khalil’s story again. Watched Rümeysa Öztürk’s video disappear from my feed.Then I shut my laptop.I was raised in South Asia. And while my U.S. citizenship has always felt like a gift, lately, it feels more like a fragile permission slip. Conditional. Revocable.That feeling only deepened as I watched stories like Khalil’s unfold.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) took Khalil from his New York City apartment — without warning — on March 8.Öztürk’s arrest became one more reason for me not to write a single targeted word. She was taken by masked immigration officials while walking down a street in Somerville, Massachusetts. No warning. No explanation. Just disappeared somewhere in Louisiana.As students at Columbia and Tufts University, both Khalil and Öztürk believed in the promise of American education. And both of them were punished. The extent of their public engagement varied; Khalil was a visible leader, and Ozturk’s public presence, by most accounts, was limited to a single op-ed she co-authored with four other students. Still, both were detained. They were made examples of what happens when you speak, or simply, write.I’ve been grappling with a reality that often catches in my throat — one that feels especially sharp in the wake of the Trump administration’s turbulence. This era has indeed left many Americans — immigrant or not — on edge, concerned about what tomorrow might bring. But the uncertainty doesn’t fall on all of us equally. I’ve seen classmates speak freely in class, post hot takes online and walk into protests without a second thought — because for them, there is little looming threat of visa checks or ICE raids. Notable cases of students currently targeted seem to be disproportionately composed by people of color. International students have been relentlessly targeted. In early 2025, over 300 visas were revoked. And now, with Trump proposing a renewed travel ban affecting several Muslim-majority countries, the threat facing international students — especially those who are non-white or from marginalized backgrounds – has escalated. And though I am a second-generation immigrant and non-white, I recognize that my U.S. citizenship also holds a kind of privilege not often named — one that others, like Khalil and Öztürk were never afforded.I would like to think that I am unlikely to see the inside of a detention center or face deportation. That may be an imperfect truth — but for now, it is a plausible one. As of March 23, ICE was detaining 47,892 people — well over its funded capacity — with 48.1% having no criminal record. The vast majority were non-citizens, as ICE detention primarily targets those without legal status. While rare, even U.S. citizens have been mistakenly detained. In fact, Khalil’s wife is a U.S. citizen and yet she was apparently threatened with arrest just for asking where her husband was. Still, I carry a passport that, most days, still means something. I may be afraid, but I’m still speaking from a place of relative safety. So are many of us. And maybe that awareness is where something begins.I’m starting to realize that discourse has power and silence may have its own kind of cost. The plausibility in that truth settled in slowly — but it started with Professor Eric Mlyn’s community forum.That forum wasn’t just a panel talk, it was a deep exhale that professors, students and Durham community members collectively took as they all found themselves in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s policies, crafted from the comfort of the Oval Office.What became clear — through the voices of professors like Eric Mlyn, Nancy MacLean, Richard Mooney and Toddi Steelman — is that this moment is not theoretical. It’s happening right now. Budgets are being slashed. Syllabi are being rewritten. International collaborations are being reconsidered. Postdocs are looking for jobs abroad. And in some cases, jobs have already vanished — standing offers have been rescinded in an instant. I asked the panel a question, “What do you think Duke as an institution should be doing right now, and how can it set an example for other universities?” I told them how it felt like Duke was hiding — how the quiet approval of ICE presence at a campus career fair had left many of us terrified. What I really meant was: Please, tell me that this place will protect us.As they passed the microphone around and let out a collective laugh, Mlyn took the stand and gave me an answer that, at the time, left me feeling hollow.I remember him saying, “We’re a university. And so we do this first,” gesturing to the forum itself. He added, “Learning and informing this community about what’s happening … that’s where our incredible comparative advantage is.”He spoke, too, of the pressures universities now face in the wake of the Israel-Gaza war — how institutional neutrality has become a part of the conversation. But he also said that this moment does not call for neutrality. That when the mission of the university is threatened, leaders are obligated to act. In this case, they are obligated to, at the very least, speak about it. At the time, it still felt too small. Too quiet. Too slow for the urgency I carry every time I scroll through MSNBC, Fox News or the New York Times.But as I watched more jobs disappear and more stories like Khalil unfold, I realized: quiet doesn’t equal safety. And waiting doesn’t mean protection.The forum reminded me: this isn’t the first time speech has been threatened in the halls of academia.In 1903, John Spencer Bassett, a history professor at Trinity College, praised Booker T. Washington in a published editorial, calling him one of the greatest men born in the South in a hundred years. The statement sparked widespread public backlash, with political leaders and newspapers demanding his dismissal. Bassett offered his resignation, but the Trinity College Board of Trustees voted 18–7 to retain him, marking a significant early defense of academic freedom in the American South. This is an example that stands out because the institution chose to act when so many others might have folded under pressure. In the 1950s, McCarthyism swept through American institutions, and universities weren’t spared. Professors were interrogated, blacklisted and silenced. But resistance didn’t die — it moved underground, into classrooms, into letters, into whispered conversations that later became movements.After 9/11, Muslim voices were monitored, questioned and erased. But some kept speaking. Some taught classes on surveillance and civil liberties. Some wrote books. Some sat in rooms just like this one and said: We’re still here. That, too, was resistance.The list goes on, both in retrospect and in real-time. You don’t have to protest if that’s not where you are right now. Sometimes, it’s enough to ask a question out loud. To share a reading that made something click. To speak up in a room where no one else does. To start the conversation, even if you don’t know where it’ll go.I opened this document weeks ago. Today, I finish it — not because I’m no longer afraid, but because staying quiet feels worse. For me, and for us. Noor Nazir is a Trinity sophomore. Her pieces typically run on alternate Tuesdays."

Every devil for themselves ,Krisha Patel,2025-04-07T10:00:00Z,Apr,7,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/every-devil-for-themselves-20250407.html,"Humans will never escape “survival of the fittest.” Evolutionary history shows that we consistently act in our own best interest. Even when humans aren’t meant to be at the top of the food chain, human development has disrupted the ecosystem to a point where the food chain no longer affects our survival. The competition that we once faced against other species has now been completely internalized, with wars, conflict and human disease being humankind’s biggest “predator.”While our competitive nature has served as a huge driver in allowing humankind to become the intelligent species we are today, it has also led to consequential periods in our history. Time and time again, the majority has a tendency to take advantage of an oppressed minority to uphold the beliefs and values of the majority. We see such cases prevail today, with rights such as the right to an abortion and affirmative action being voted on by the majority and negatively impacting minority groups. However, governments have also shifted to be freer, richer and less violent over time. Whether this is simply a product of our cognitive evolution or a product of institutionalized norms that protect the majority, there has been an overall increase in prosperity. It is both human nature to progress collectively and be ‘selfish.’At Duke, this duality manifests in both the benefits of ambition — fostering innovation, collaboration and excellence — and its drawbacks, such as the perpetuation of privilege. Understanding this balance allows us to navigate competition in a way that enhances, rather than hinders, our community.Duke’s culture thrives from both the positives and negatives of “survival of the fittest.” On the positive, our competitive nature serves as an important driver in allowing Duke to be the collaborative, unique and diverse community we see today. Our competitive nature encourages us to form study groups, engage in research and build networks. Our competitive nature pushes us to innovate and have an impact in the extracurriculars we are a part of. Our competitive nature has created the best student section in college basketball.On the negative, the lack of socioeconomic diversity at Duke leaves privileged majority groups to drive the culture at Duke, worsening outcomes for minorities. Nearly half of students at Duke can afford to pay the $90,000+ it costs to attend Duke. Those same students often have access to opportunities in both academic and social spheres that perpetuate a narrative of what it means to be successful at Duke. Whether these opportunities are having connections that provide pathways to exclusive internships or having the finances to fully engage in Duke’s social scene, access to opportunities has shifted the standard at Duke. So, how do we combat the negative aspects of competition while maintaining the strength of the Duke community?Well, addressing humankind’s competitive, cutthroat nature without addressing our empathetic and altruistic nature would be disrespectful to who we are as humans. As humans, we have developed a level of intelligence in our evolutionary journey where we have been able to establish social norms and expectations for people to exhibit empathy and kindness. These principles didn’t spawn from nowhere; humans hold the innate ability to empathize with others. We have various cognitive tools and neurotic structures that allow us to unconsciously read people’s faces and their intentions. And this framework is not in place so we can compete with people, but so we can empathize with them. Humans have evolved to exhibit empathetic behavior because it contributes to our genetic fitness.In a series of studies known as the “Born Good” studies, a series of experiments were conducted to explore whether humans have an innate sense of morality, particularly in infancy or if moral behaviors are entirely learned through socialization. In one particular experiment, children of varying ages were given the task of choosing between two distributions of tokens divided among themselves and an unknown peer. Younger children tend to always choose the distribution that gave them relatively more tokens than their peers, even if this meant they would have more tokens if they had chosen the fairer distribution. Our innate internal competitive nature trumps our innate internal empathy at a young age. However, as they got older, the children decided to be more fair with the token distribution, even reaching a point where they gave more tokens to their opponent. Older children engaged in more prosocial behavior, or intentional action to help other individuals or groups.Whether we would be able to grow out of our natural competitive nature without the institution of social norms remains unknown. Considering how we are gradually shifting towards a more egalitarian society, social norms have played a large role in allowing humankind to become more outwardly empathetic. We have successfully utilized social norms to take advantage of our internal egoistic character and push us to be kinder people. So even if our actions do not have altruistic motives, it is our actions, not our motives, that make society more just and free for all.Like the older children in the “Born Good” studies, students at Duke also have the power to redistribute opportunities so that all students can find their place here. Whether this is by changing social norms to redefine what it means to be successful, creating mentorship and peer-support programs or utilizing our alumni network to help all students, the Duke community owes it to itself to break down barriers and build a culture where all students, regardless of background, can flourish.Krisha Patel is a Trinity first-year."
Learning to love Madrid (study abroad) without a ‘found family’,Valentina Garbelotto,2025-04-04T10:00:00Z,Apr,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/learning-to-love-madrid-20250404.html,"I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of a “found family.” Stories like Percy Jackson and Harry Potter (insert any other cliche series) promised me that, amidst new adventures and challenges, I’d cross paths with the people I’m meant to meet and they would become my second family. In high school, amidst acne, bullying, and the constant feeling of not fitting in, I clung to that idea. When I read “Anna and the French Kiss,” studying abroad in a far-off land became my ideal getaway: leaving behind everything I struggled with at home and instantly belonging.But, as with many dreams, reality got in the way. Money, logistics and my own fears put my study abroad fantasy on hold. Instead, I chose to attend college in my former home, the U.S., and when that dream became a reality, studying abroad slipped from my mind. College life consumed me: rushing between lectures, juggling to-do lists and cramming for exams left little time to recall distant fantasies.Fast forward to now: Here I am in Madrid, my 15-year-old teenage dream finally realized. A new city, a new country and, thankfully, a language I already call my own. What more could I want?Yet, the truth is, this experience hasn’t quite matched the fantasy adventure I envisioned. I didn’t expect epic, life-or-death adventures, but I did expect to find my people, a close-knit group I could call home. Movies, social media and other students’ stories painted the same picture: You’ll arrive, meet like-minded people and effortlessly form lifelong friendships. This romanticized notion made it seem like friendship was a guarantee rather than something that takes time and effort. But while the idea that our second family will materialize from thin air sounds magical, reality is rarely that simple.I’ve never found it easy to make friends in class. In high school, with only 30 students in my economics concentration, friendships developed naturally. But at Duke, I justified my lack of classroom friendships with “I need to focus on work.” And while that excuse held some truth, I think a part of me was still stuck in high school: afraid to force connections, afraid of rejection.Outside of academics, friendships came more naturally. I found my people in dorms, clubs and internships, but it took time — semesters, even. Now, I have friends from different circles whom I deeply trust, but those relationships weren’t instant. So why did I expect Madrid to be any different?The Duke in Madrid program is small. It’s just five of us this spring compared to 50 in the fall. The odds of taking classes with other Duke students are slim, and none of my closest friends joined me here. Without a built-in support system, I quickly realized that making new friends wouldn’t be as effortless as I had imagined.At the University Carlos III of Madrid, the classroom feels like a maze of cold, metal chairs. The faint hum of fluorescent lights echoes in the silence, and the air feels thick with the weight of unspoken social rules. I can almost taste my awkwardness. As I scan the room for a place to sit, my mind races, but the familiar unease creeps in, that same tight knot in my stomach as when I was the new kid in high school. The students around me have already formed their little circles, their murmurs a wall I can't break through. I stare blankly ahead, and the conversations move in a rhythm I can’t follow — like being a dancer in a room full of people who already know the steps.I’m an outsider, trying to break into pre-established social circles that already have inside jokes, shared experiences and unspoken bonds. I find myself constantly battling an internal struggle: Do I force friendships for the sake of not being alone, or do I wait for something that feels real? I’m still looking for my “study abroad soulmate,” but it hasn’t come naturally as I had imagined.What’s strange is that in a way, Madrid feels familiar — almost too familiar. The educational system in Spain isn’t vastly different from what I experienced back in Argentina. The set curriculum leading to classes with the same people, the unspoken hierarchy between students and professors, the way social circles form — it all feels like home. Academically, Madrid presents new challenges. A passing grade is a 5, or 50% (as opposed to Duke’s grade inflation). This, plus professors being reluctant to give grades higher than 7, shifts the focus from maintaining a 4.0 to simply getting by. Professors deduct points for wrong answers on multiple-choice exams, there are no office hours for extra support and rote memorization takes precedence over real-world application. It’s a system I understand, one I know how to navigate. But instead of feeling liberated by my familiarity, I feel stuck in the same cycle I wanted to escape.I came to Madrid expecting something entirely new, a fresh start in an unfamiliar environment. Instead, I find myself in a world that feels like an extension of my past, a parallel version of what I thought I had left behind. And perhaps that’s what’s truly strange, not the similarities themselves, but the realization that no matter where I go, certain aspects of life remain constant.I came here seeking something new, yet I find myself battling the same insecurities. I wish I were bold enough to strike up conversations with strangers, but something holds me back. I freeze, retreating into my quiet, middle school self — the one before I became quietly extroverted. Maybe I feel less brave this semester, and that’s okay. We don’t always have to push ourselves beyond our comfort zones; sometimes, just being in a new country is enough.As the weeks go by, I’m accepting that my study abroad experience might not be what I expected. Maybe I won’t find a close-knit group of friends, or maybe I will, but not overnight. I’m slowly coming to terms with the fact that my experience here is going to be more solitary than my teenage fantasy. But the discomfort is allowing me to grow in unexpected ways.At Duke, the idea of being seen by myself was terrifying. I used to dread being alone, my eyes fixed on my phone to avoid the weight of being by myself. But now, I’m learning to embrace it and turn my gaze outward. I notice the intricate patterns of the floor tiles in my favorite restaurant, the quiet hum of the city waking up, the way the sunlight filters through the trees in the park next to my homestay. I’m no longer in a rush to find someone to sit with, to fill the silence. Madrid is beautiful — its history, architecture, parks and food offer endless wonders. I would love a group of Spanish friends leading the way, but I’ve realized I don’t need them to fall in love with it. Madrid itself has become a companion, a character in my story. And though I haven't immediately connected with its people (of my age), I’ve found something just as valuable: the ability to experience life on my own terms. After all, solitude isn’t synonymous with loneliness. I used to believe that enjoying a place required a strong support system, surrounded by those who understood me and shared my experiences. But now, I’m starting to see that adulting means finding trust in yourself. I don’t need constant companionship to feel connected to the world around me. I can wander through Madrid, explore libraries and museums, and still feel connected to the world around me. I’ve come a long way from the co-dependent junior who was scared to face the world by herself in North Carolina.I wish I were writing the typical study abroad article, where I met my new best friends within a month and we spent every weekend exploring the city together. But that’s not my reality, and I’m coming to terms with that. This isn’t to say I haven’t made any connections. I’ve had meaningful conversations, shared fleeting moments with kind strangers, and formed subtle bonds. But these relationships don’t fit the “found family” narrative I had in my head. They are subtler, more transient shared experiences.There will come times in our lives when the dreams we've clung to for so long don't turn out how we once hoped, but that shouldn’t diminish their value. Give yourself permission to grieve the gap between expectation and reality, and feel the disappointment. In time, you might discover that this new version of your dream is even more meaningful. This semester has turned out to be a different kind of adventure than I imagined, but one I wouldn’t trade for anything. If studying abroad or going to college in another country scares you even more as you read this, I encourage you to take the leap anyway. You might just find that you learn to enjoy your own company along the way. Ultimately, study abroad isn’t necessarily about finding a “found family.” It’s about learning to trust yourself. I’ll always have my support system back home (and that’s something no new city can replace). But here, while in Madrid, I’m discovering how to navigate life on my own terms.And for now, that’s more than enough.Valentina Garbelotto is a Trinity junior.

Duke’s ‘White Lotus’ blunder: Sometimes less is more,Alex Berkman,2025-04-04T10:00:00Z,Apr,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-white-lotus-less-is-more-20250404.html,"I have a friend named John. John has a lot going for him. He’s funny, charismatic and relatively tall. He’s a straight-A student, adored by all who know him and he volunteers at a local children’s hospital for fun. John’s the type of guy who loves to make the rest of us feel like real D-bags. However, John has one flaw. Whenever we go out to dinner, he must inform the waiter of his “severe peanut allergy.” Now, John having a peanut allergy is tolerable. It’s his comment after that makes my eyes roll so far back behind my head. “Hey fellas! You know that I have a peanut allergy. It’s not something I asked for, so I’d appreciate it if you keep the jokes to a minimum.”Now, there are two reasons this bothers me. First, by drawing attention to his pathetic allergy, he increases the chance of blowing my cover that I too am allergic to those murderous nuts. And second, in trying to downplay his connection to the peanut, John ends up spotlighting it. No one cared about his allergy before — but by bringing it up again, he amplifies the attention it receives. It seems John needs a new PR manager. Let’s hope he does not hire Duke’s guy. Okay, spoiler: There is no John. And, I don’t actually have a peanut allergy … Duke University is John, and the peanut allergy is the unhinged actor from “The White Lotus” who for all his fortune seemingly owns but one shirt — a gray one with a massive Duke logo plastered across the front.For those unfamiliar, Season 3 of HBO's “The White Lotus” highlights Duke through the Ratliff family, with the patriarch, Timothy Ratliff (played by Jason Isaacs), and his son, Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), depicted as Duke alumni. While the characters drew some early criticism, it was a particular scene in Episode 6 — where Timothy raises a gun to his head while wearing Duke apparel — that led the University to issue a response.That is, on March 25, Frank Tramble, Duke’s vice president for communications, marketing and public affairs, released a statement to Bloomberg News, expressing Duke’s frustration with their representation in the hit HBO show. In the statement, Tramble wrote, “The White Lotus not only uses our brand without permission, but in our view uses it on imagery that is troubling, does not reflect our values or who we are, and simply goes too far.” Duke’s displeasure is understandable. After all, I’d imagine that Saxon (a chauvinistic nepotism baby) and Timothy (a suicidal money launderer) would not have been their first choices to represent the University. To make matters worse, UNC is portrayed in an almost saintly light. Their representative, Piper — a senior and the family’s daughter — is compassionate, down-to-earth and, naturally, an aspiring Buddhist.But forget the fact that the portrayal is offensive — it’s downright inaccurate. I mean, for one, I have never met a single person at Duke like Saxon …Okay, that’s a lie. And sure, I’ve met plenty of Iron Dukes like Timothy, but that’s neither here nor there.Listen, I do not blame Duke for condemning their inclusion in “The White Lotus.” It is a sheer fallacy that all publicity is good publicity — especially when it involves suicidal ideation. No university wants to be linked to such imagery, particularly when suicide is “the second-leading cause of death on college campuses” as mentioned by Tramble. Thus, I’d estimate that just about every university would have taken a similar position. Nonetheless, if Duke had leaned away from their army of consultants and lawyers in favor of listening to me — an obnoxious Chronicle writer with a peanut allergy — I would have told the school to refrain. Had Duke chosen silence, sure, a few memes would flicker across screens, particularly if the team loses in the Final Four. Yet it’s hard to see that any fans of the show would genuinely tie the University to drugs, despair or high-stakes fraud. And given the character draped in Duke’s name, few would suspect the school endorsed the portrayal.But by choosing to release a statement, Duke has now drawn more attention than it could have desired. CNN, USA Today, NBC and The New York Times are only some of the organizations to have covered the story. At the same time, millions of Americans who likely had never even heard of “The White Lotus” have now seen the infamous image of Timothy Ratliff. Of course, if Duke were to have a legitimate case for defamation, my opinion would be different. But, as stated by Scott Landsbaum, an intellectual property business attorney, shows and films are afforded significant “protection under the First Amendment for artistic endeavors as long as you’re not doing something that would be considered defamatory … Simply showing some copyrighted work on a T-shirt is fair use.” When I first read The Chronicle's article reporting on the subject, I could not help but be reminded of the times my family hosted everyone over for the holidays. There, my mom partakes in the quiet tradition of offering little disclaimers about the meal before anyone’s even taken a bite.“I think the turkey might be a little overcooked.”“I tried something new with the soup — hopefully it’s okay.”“I didn’t have time to bake, so the brownies are from the store.”It’s her way of managing expectations, though no one’s ever complained — and honestly, we’d miss it if she didn’t.So, with this in mind … To Mom: The dog — I mean I — will love your food regardless. To John: It’s okay that you are allergic to peanuts. Just don’t drag me down with you. And to Duke: No one blames you for Mike White’s creative decisions. He’s probably a Tarheel fan.

It’s time to reaffiliate Greek life,Adam Levin,2025-04-03T10:00:00Z,Apr,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/time-to-reaffiliate-greek-life-20250403.html,"On Friday, March 21, the joint quads of Crowell, Kilgo, Craven and Few held a Central Campus party: “A Night in Rio.” The councils went all out, contracting a student DJ and covering the tent in decorations. However, I wouldn’t blame you if you hadn’t heard about it — most people didn’t. An hour into the party, at its peak, only about 20 people were in attendance. In the pretty expansive Central Campus tent, that is hardly enough for a rager. Unfortunately, that party was the same night as Alpha Tau Omega (ATO)’s “Taumorrowland” party, which you are more likely to have heard about, and had much more than 20 people in attendance. This observation is not to mock the hard work of the quad councils or further hype up the ATO social chairs. Rather, it points out a larger problem with Duke's approach to social life. The Duke administration seems to believe that keeping Greek life off campus and creating QuadEx housing and parties will make the university more inclusive and end our dependence on fraternity parties for Duke’s social scene. It won’t. Maybe it’s a branding thing: After all, Duke’s tour guides are encouraged to underemphasize the impact of Greek life on campus and promote QuadEx as similar to peer institutions. No matter the reason, the Class of 2026 and 2027, who both experienced the implementation of QuadEx, remain relatively interested in Greek life, at 60% and 61%, respectively. It’s pretty clear that QuadEx has not acted as a replacement for Greek life, and discontinuing on-campus housing for Selective Living Groups has probably aided in its growth. So, if forcing Greek Life to remain off campus hasn’t decreased the influence of fraternities and sororities on culture, what has it done? Placing fraternity houses next to essential workers and families with children has likely worsened our relations with the Durham community, exposed Duke students to possible criminal charges and weakened oversight of the Greek life system.Duke’s history with Durham is not without tension. Beyond its literal demolition of dozens of homes during its expansion in 1965, Duke today remains an isolated, closed-off, wealthy bubble in a city suffering from high rates of poverty in certain areas. While Duke has contributed to community programs and revitalizations, it received significant criticism for unilaterally killing a billion-dollar light rail project in 2019. As recently as 2004, it apparently contributed “far less than what Princeton, Harvard, and Brown universities pay to their host cities.” To be fair, there were already some off-campus parties before Greek Life disaffiliated in 2021. But it’s not a positive step forward in Duke-Durham relations to add more literal party houses and off-campus functions in residential neighborhoods. Our desire to let off steam and celebrate in a crowded house at midnight cannot come before the needs of the Durham community to sleep, work and raise children. As a response, Duke has implemented The Good Neighbor program, which “advises students to keep gatherings to less than 30 people.” While it seems “A Night in Rio” followed that advice, it would be laughable to believe that a single off-campus party this year has remained below 30 people. These parties have already created increased resentment: In 2022, 300 Durham residents signed a petition arguing that the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity’s ownership of five single-family homes “tremendously impacted the quality of life of our neighbors.”Increased negative interactions with Durham residents and Duke students are toxic to the Durham community and broader university relations, as well as to the futures of undergraduates. As The Chronicle previously reported, “the number of calls by concerned neighbors has disproportionately increased for some fraternities since August 2023.” The charges range pretty broadly, from alcohol to noise or building code-related. And while all previous charges have been dropped, the increased police presence puts students at risk of civil or criminal charges. Any of these citations can be expensive legal hassles, but charges like giving or selling alcohol to minors under 21 could potentially damage employment or graduate opportunities. It’s absurd then, that in Duke’s quest to reduce its liability or improve its image, the administration simply pushed liability onto any students associated with Greek life. And with liability comes oversight. Shifting oversight doesn’t only mean less immediate access to campus resources or healthcare services in the event of an emergency at a party. It means that instead of having the ability to disband or suspend chapters, deal with organizational-level scandals or enforce safety protocols, Duke’s administration leaves it up to the chapters to decide for themselves. However much faith you may have in the Greek life chapters at our school, that will never be an effective policy: There’s much less incentive to legitimize and deal with misconduct without the administration breathing down your neck. After chapters disaffiliated at West Virginia University, for example, risk standards across every fraternity became far more inconsistent, and national organizations lacked the ability to monitor local activities effectively. If off-campus fraternity life is so unsustainable, the question becomes, what should the administration do? Recently, they’ve opened up Central Campus to Greek life parties, putting Duke security around the event and offering direct bus rides from West Campus. This development might solve some problems for some parties, but it doesn’t solve the greater issue of off-campus house functions or disaffiliation. In 2024, a previous Chronicle opinion article argued for creating Greek life sections within the QuadEx housing community. I think the best option, however unrealistic it may be, is to use the rezoned Central Campus to build a Greek row. Yes, it might embrace exclusivity and admit defeat to the forces of Greek life, which Duke’s administration clearly wants anything but. However, it’s far preferable to the status quo, which prioritizes institutional image over the actual lives of Duke students and the Durham community. Adam Levin is a Trinity first-year.

The road less traveled: Choosing Duke over studying abroad,Kareena Sukhnanan,2025-04-03T10:00:00Z,Apr,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/road-less-traveled-20250403.html,"Before I came to Duke, studying abroad seemed like a thrilling personal adventure — an exciting choice shaped by personal experiences, drawn to satisfy through adventure. However, as my junior year draws to a close, I’ve come to realize that at Duke, studying abroad isn’t just an opportunity; it’s almost expected.It seems to me that studying abroad has become a socially-sanctioned break from the relentless pace of campus life. The way weekend travel destinations are labeled often makes the idea of studying abroad feel less like genuine immersion and more like a contest based on location. The lottery system was recently replaced by a rubric system to address these issues, when 56% of Duke Students studying abroad in fall 2023 spanned only 3 programs — limiting the diversity of their experiences.However, studying abroad is a chance some Duke students simply can’t afford to take. It’s not merely a choice; it’s a privilege. Students from wealthy families are disproportionately the population of students that can afford this opportunity, as studies find that affluent students are about 50% more likely to engage in study abroad programs.For some, stepping away from the pressures of academics and extracurriculars for an entire semester feels more like an unattainable luxury than a transformative experience. I’ve often been told that at Duke, studying abroad is a rite of passage — an expectation both socially and experientially. The culture here often frames it as essential, as if it’s a must-do for any student who wants to see the world, with the common refrain, “You may never have another opportunity like it.” And after all, “Work hard and play harder!”But the truth is that the world will still be there to explore when you finish at Duke, whereas the opportunity to spend a semester here — immersed in our globally-ranked academics and research — is irreplaceable. It seems ironic to me that many students aspire to attend Duke, and yet almost fifty percent of Duke undergraduates study abroad, the highest percentage of all the top ten private research universities.I wonder, how many students would jump at the chance to take their spot for just one semester? After all, thousands of highly qualified and driven applicants get rejected every year — people who might jump at the opportunity to study here for every semester they could get.Choosing to stay on campus while many of my peers decided to study abroad has given me a unique perspective on what it means to be a student here. At first, it felt like I was making a somewhat unpopular decision. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to experience a new country or culture — far from it. I’ve always dreamed of traveling the world, and I know I will in the future when I have a career with more stability. Instead, I felt a pull to stay and dive deeper into the opportunities right here on campus — after all, I only had two years left at Duke.I’ll admit — the campus was definitely empty, and many of my peers described it as “quiet.” But we all agreed that this was a nice kind of quiet that allowed us to immerse ourselves and dive further into our future aspirations — like, for me, preparing to apply to medical school by finishing mandatory classes, working in my research lab, engaging with patients at Duke Hospital and shadowing talented physicians at Duke that I would have never gotten the opportunity to observe elsewhere.The responses from my peers and acquaintances ranged from, “Why would you do that to yourself?” to “But everyone else is ...” Yet I’m still confident in the positive effects of my choice to remain at Duke.Ultimately, choosing to stay on campus has been a decision shaped by my own personality, passions and path. However, it has also made me more aware of how deeply Duke’s culture is shaped by privilege and opportunity, especially when it comes to studying abroad, which is a costly experience both financially and academically. After all, while one might argue that classes abroad offer an enriching new experience, many students remark on their laid-back and lenient nature.My decision to stay at Duke reflects the reality that not all paths to personal growth or fulfillment in college look the same. This fall, I was able to complete hundreds of hours of both clinical exposure and volunteering, publish additional papers in my cancer research lab and found the first Duke chapter of the American Cancer Society. I also developed deeper relationships with patients and explored specific medical specialties by learning directly from some of the top doctors in the world. On top of that, I finished my biology major over one and a half years early, which gave me the flexibility to double major in neuroscience and take even more rigorous Duke courses to pursue my academic passions. After all, I only have one year left now!As the first in my family to pursue medicine, this is why I chose to come to Duke, and it is an opportunity I would have not been able to strengthen if I took months away from campus. My time at Duke is unfolding in its own way, and though it may be different from that of my peers abroad, it is no less meaningful. Above all, this experience reminded me that growth doesn’t always come from leaving — it can also come from staying. Kareena Sukhnanan is a Trinity junior.

Tell me more,Shruthi Narayanan,2025-04-02T10:00:00Z,Apr,2,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/tell-me-more-20250402.html,"The reason I decided to write this column stems from a personal struggle with listening. Growing up with a father who commanded attention through his speech created a powerful impression. He would enter a room, and soon, an orbit formed around him. He seamlessly intertwined humor, knowledge and opinions into an effortless monologue. All eyes on him. His charisma was magnetic, leaving everyone watching in awe as people hung on to his every word.This shaped a young girl who craved similar attention. The desire to command rooms into fits of laughter and leave everyone in awe with wit and wisdom became overwhelming. The spotlight seemed like such a comforting place to exist. Somewhere on the journey from twelve-year-old girl to aspiring oratory spectacle came the belief that the only way to capture attention was to speak. The presence of my voice became a flag planted firmly in the soil of every conversation. This belief shaped my interactions with everyone I encountered.How times change!Neuroscience reveals that humans don't merely notice those who listen — their brains actually reward them for it. In a fascinating fMRI study by Kawamichi et al., researchers discovered that perceiving active listening activates the ventral striatum — the brain's reward center. Participants not only rated those who exhibited active listening more positively, but they also viewed their own personal experiences more favorably when discussed with attentive listeners. The brain literally processes being heard as a rewarding experience.Ted Lasso once said ""Be curious, not judgmental.""Most of us carry what might be called a tote bag of preoccupations and biases on our shoulders. This metaphorical load manifests in our listening habits — appearing in the AirPods left in ears while ordering Beyu coffee or, conversely, in phones placed on Do Not Disturb during intentional social interactions like FLUNCH.Judgment represents the epitome of covering ears to let mouths talk. Making assumptions is easy, but remaining curious is freeing. When someone fails to hold open the heavy doors of the Brodhead Center, rather than labeling them as rude, students can simply push the door open and allow their actions to exist without explanation. Their reasons remain a mystery, and that's perfectly acceptable.With simple prompts like ""how,"" ""why"" or ""tell me more,"" people transform before our eyes. They become brave knights and heroes in their own narratives while stronger connections blossom between us.The Duke community brims with voices some might dismiss as background noise. Hidden within a professor's apparent tangent often lies a message worth hearing. We attend classes alongside some of the most fascinating individuals we'll ever encounter — making bridge-building not just a social activity but almost a moral obligation. Sometimes, precisely the right words find us at exactly the right moment, regardless of who delivers them.A couple of months ago, I had a really bad stomach ache. It ended up being no big deal at all and more of a reflection of my low tolerance; regardless, I had gone to CVS to pick up some medication. I bought the medicine and ordered my Uber home. I was so annoyed; it was a crisp fall Saturday, and I had spent it in discomfort. My Uber arrives to pick me up, and I get in. I normally am one to start the conversation, but my irritation got the best of me. I decided to put my AirPods in. A couple of minutes into my ride, they died. My annoyance with the day only grew. Finally, the very sweet older woman driving my car broke the silence. “This weather is beautiful,” she said.“Yeah,” I replied. As we turned onto Duke’s campus, the sun began to set. The sky was ornamented with swirls of pink and orange, and a golden haze settled upon our gothic architecture. And with timing almost too perfect to be true, she turned to me and said, “How lucky are we that the switch from day to night is this beautiful?”She was right. My stomach hurt, but she was right. I spent a Saturday annoyed in bed, but she was right.The death of my AirPods let me re-enter my gratitude for the life I have and the world I get to live in. The universe forced me to listen and delivered me a sermon I needed to hear. The talkative nature I inherited from my father remains — the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, after all. But more of my sentences now end with question marks.

The dangerous path of permitless carry in North Carolina,Aria Dwoskin,2025-04-02T10:00:00Z,Apr,2,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/dangerous-path-permitless-carry-north-carolina-20250402.html,"On March 20, the North Carolina Senate passed Senate Bill 50 “Freedom to Carry NC” in a 26-18 vote. This bill, which has now advanced to the House, is an act to “protect a person’s right to carry a concealed handgun without a permit.” Under this bill, any North Carolina citizen over the age of 18 would be allowed to carry handguns in a concealed manner without obtaining a permit. It is important to note that this applies specifically to concealed handguns, meaning the individual is able to hide the firearm from public view. This bill represents a significant shift in North Carolina’s current gun laws. As of now, only people over the age of 21 can carry a concealed handgun, and they must first obtain a permit. Securing a permit requires applicants to visit their local sheriff’s office, complete eight hours of safety and training courses and pass a background check.Senate Bill 50 eliminates these requirements entirely. The minimum age would be reduced by three years, and there would no longer be a mandated training course or background check. To many, this is an alarming prospect. However, the Republican senators sponsoring this bill — Danny Earl Britt, Warren Daniel and Eddie Settle — argue that they are defending their constituents constitutional rights by ensuring “that law-abiding citizens should be able to exercise their Second Amendment rights without getting permission from the government.” These senators aim to align North Carolina with the 29 states that allow permitless concealed carry, commonly referred to as “constitutional carry.” Proponents of this measure claim that unrestricted access to firearms ensures personal protection, deterring and more quickly stopping mass shootings. This is not the case. While two states — Ohio and Indiana — saw fewer shootings following the implementation of permitless carry, and two saw no statistical change, The Trace found that, out of the 20 states that passed permitless carry laws between 2015 and 2022, 16 saw an increase in gun-related deaths. More specifically, within three years of enacting permitless carry, the average number of monthly shooting fatalities rose in Missouri by 28.7%. Similarly, Kansas reported a 24.9% increase, and West Virginia experienced a drastic 40.2% spike in shooting fatalities. The data deeply undermines any possible case for supporting a constitutional carry. Yet the North Carolina Senate just championed this exact law. In 2023, North Carolina had 33 mass shootings, a significant increase from previous years. In 2024, North Carolina experienced 15 mass shootings. So far in 2025, North Carolina has had one recorded mass shooting. These statistics underscore the ongoing issue of gun violence in our state. Yet Republican legislators continue to advocate for further deregulation. Executive director of North Carolinians Against Gun Violence, Becky Ceartas warned, “Make no mistake, if Senate Bill 50 passes, the research is clear: it will be paid for in North Carolinian lives.” Ceartas’ statement is not speculative; the data overwhelmingly points to this devastating truth. With Republicans controlling the North Carolina House, Senate Bill 50 is likely to pass. There is hope that, if this is the case, North Carolina will align with the two states that saw fewer mass shootings, but sadly the odds are against it.After reading this news, I felt a growing sense of hopelessness, anxiety and fear. Fear not only for the gun violence that plagues our country, but also for the state of our political landscape. I am from Michigan, a state that endured two major school shootings in recent years. I was a sophomore in high school when, just 45 minutes away, Ethan Crumbley opened fire on Oxford High School, killing four students. A year later, when I was a junior, a shooting erupted at Michigan State University, where many of my friends attended, and claimed the lives of three students.For me, gun violence has never felt like a distant issue. It has long been in my backyard, with my home-state experiencing its horrors firsthand. I refuse to live under the illusion that the solution is to increase easy-access to firearms. However, living in North Carolina, it seems that my state legislators do not share this perspective. Despite rising gun violence — 2025 has already seen 76 mass shootings this year — lawmakers continue to push legislation that prioritizes deregulation over public safety. And the people can feel this dissonance.After the 2018 Parkland shooting, which devastatingly took the lives of 17 students, gun safety activists across the country mobilized to urge leaders to prioritize common-sense gun legislation. Yet seven years later, Republican leaders are still not listening. As a result, gun violence is increasingly perceived as an unsolvable crisis. The normalization of mass shootings, paired with blatant neglect from leadership, fosters mass hopelessness, desensitization and political apathy. But gun violence is not an inevitability. Thoughtful policy changes could significantly reduce shooting fatalities in a relatively short period. We must resist the urge to accept gun violence as an unavoidable, inherent aspect of American life. With each passing tragedy, we risk becoming numb to the devastation and complacent as lawmakers enact policies that endanger our lives. We must not fall into a place of political hopelessness, and instead continue to champion policies that prioritize our safety. North Carolina is at a critical moment, and I only hope that its leaders choose the path that prioritizes lives over politics. Aria Dwoskin is a Trinity first-year.

It’s more than just a fun thing: On the 3/29 Holi ‘darty’,Advikaa Anand,2025-04-01T10:00:00Z,Apr,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/more-than-fun-thing-holi-darty-20250401.html,"One of my favorite childhood memories was celebrating Holi in India. A picture in my kitchen at home immortalizes the moment: vibrant colors gleaming on my face as yellow, red and pink became indistinguishable from one another. The air is tinged a bright orange, and the concrete parking lot below the balcony is barely perceptible in the flooding of red sloshy water, plastic bags of color floating across it. When I saw the mass entry of students dressed in white and holding color packets into WU, as we typically do during Holi, my mind was seized by evocations of these old memories. For a fleeting second, my heart was tinged with a hint of regret that I had missed such an opportunity to celebrate my culture. Growing up in a small town in Mississippi, I rarely experienced opportunities to glimpse my culture and its various celebrations in the mainstream. On important holidays, I would attend school concealing the bursting excitement within my heart. Seeing that the joys of Holi were shared with a greater proportion of the Duke community through the Wayne selective living group (SLG) celebration — which, as implied by the fact that it took place in the middle of the day on Saturday in a field, was a “darty” — sparked wonder within me. I was thrilled that the “mainstreaming” of the event enabled not only more South Asian individuals to celebrate their own culture but also more individuals from other cultural backgrounds to learn about this unique cultural and religious event.While I champion intercultural festivities, I feel obligated to also acknowledge the harm that can be perpetuated when these events do not fully acknowledge the full cultural significance of an event. When what seems to be a majority-white institution, such as an SLG, organizes a cultural event (as Wayne made explicit through their Holi banner) that is primarily celebrated by people of color, they incur the risk of diminishing the event’s cultural significance. While the Hindu Student Association also hosted a similar event, their Instagram explicitly acknowledged it as the “festival of colors.”The SLG turned it into an event simply to have fun, which is great, but allows individuals to have fun without understanding the full context of the event they are attending. They can also further marginalize the stories of communities that have long endured histories of cultural appropriation and oppression, as South Asia did for centuries under the British Raj. Events that completely discount the cultural significance of celebrations while continuing to hold them under the same name represent a much larger power dynamic that continues to exist between white people and people of color, which is further perpetuated by such cultural appropriations. My culture is not for cherry-picking: You cannot simply pluck the parts that seem fun and forget the rest. I would be remiss not to acknowledge the fact that as Indian, Hindu people, we do the same thing. We erect Christmas trees in our homes without knowing that the tradition originated in 16th century Germany, where Christians lit up trees as a celebration of the solstice. We adorn ourselves with the four-leaf clovers of St. Patty’s day without realizing that it celebrates the life of Saint Patrick, using the “shamrock,” better known as the four-leaf clover, to explain the Holy Trinity. Yet, both of these holidays have been integrated into broader culture over time as potentially secular as well. Christmas is celebrated culturally by non-Christians because it is a fundamental part of Western culture, with secular customs as well as religious customs. The same holds true for St. Patrick’s day, which has been transformed into a celebration of Irish heritage and culture, with secular parades and icons. This is not the case for Holi, which has not been mainstreamed into American culture in the same way. In the United States at least, it remains a fundamentally religious holiday celebrated by Hindus to commemorate spring, love and the triumph of good over evil through bonfires, throwing color and food. The colors themselves represent various things. Red symbolizes love and blue symbolizes Lord Krishna, the Hindu god of compassion, protection and love.Various colors hold great significance in Hindu tradition, and when we color each other, we are wishing that the power of these symbols be imparted unto our fellow human beings. When these colors are thrown around meaninglessly, without explicit acknowledgement and awareness of their immense religious importance, it not only desecrates traditions that have been upheld and cherished by millions for centuries but also robs ourselves of the opportunity to be spiritually and emotionally enriched by their deeper meaning. It is wonderful that through this event, Duke students were provided an opportunity to partake in the rich cultural celebrations while also enjoying themselves. But when this fun is prioritized at the cost of cultural and religious sensitivity, we deprive ourselves of meaningful connections with other people and cultures. We further perpetuate legacies of cultural appropriation and destruction from centuries of colonization when we marginalize the context of celebrations. What might be a fun “darty” for you is of immense religious and cultural significance to someone else. To forget that dishonors the shared responsibility we have as Duke students to not only honor our diverse backgrounds but to also honor each other. Advikaa Anand is a Trinity junior.

Duke introduces mandatory P-Construction program for Class of 2029 amid Duke housing crisis,Monday Monday,2025-04-01T10:00:00Z,Apr,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/mandatory-p-construction-20250401.html,"Editor's note: The article below is satire.While Duke hasn't released admissions decisions for the Class of 2029, it is rumored that Duke admitted twice the number of students that East Campus can house. As a result of the increased housing demand, the University's president and Board of Trustees visited East Campus to see if it would be possible to quickly build more residence halls before fall 2025. To their dismay, they discovered their other million-dollar construction projects were still underway. After one look at the eight (literally) excavators in the middle of the quad, they realized that they did not have enough workers to finish the current projects and start building the new dorms.When they arrived back on West Campus, the administrators held an emergency meeting, and a brand new initiative was born. Now, the incoming freshmen will be used as labor to build their future campus. To ease freshmen into this unprecedented position, the president abolished all orientation programs, even the existing P-Build, to start a fresh program: P-Construction. However, instead of starting orientation the week before classes, students will arrive on campus in June to get to work on their new homes.Each student will get a blue construction hat and some tools instead of the traditional blue devil horns when they arrive. Icebreakers will consist of students sharing with everyone their previous exposure to construction, which will play an important role in determining where students are assigned on construction tasks. Factors such as knowledge gained from family members who work in construction to lessons learned during inconvenient remodeling of their NYC penthouses will guide the process. The icebreakers will also help the first-year students quickly gauge who will thank the bus drivers versus who will be in Greek organizations. Students will all have to download an app called ""Duke Dirt"" that tracks the students' timecards and working schedules. The app includes features like ""Panic Button"" for when students accidentally hit a water main and ""Legacy Excuse"" for students whose parents donated buildings to skip shifts.Whoever completes the most overtime work can waive the easy general education requirements and automatically graduate with at least cum laude. If students are caught slacking, they must add classes to their schedule for Monday-Friday that all start at 8:30 a.m. and will start off their college experience with a 2.7 GPA.Monday Monday would like to give their sincerest apologies for not publishing for a month. As punishment, they will leave their lovely West Campus abode to pitch a tent on East and help test out the P-Construction program starting later tonight."
Why I write … and why maybe you should too,Samantha George,2025-03-31T10:00:00Z,Mar,31,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/why-i-write-20250331.html,"“If you can't write clearly, you probably don't think nearly as well as you think you do.” - Kurt VonnegutFellow literature nerds will know that just by naming this piece “Why I Write,” I am inviting myself to a seat at a celebrity table. Famously, George Orwell and Joan Didion have published essays of the same title, in 1946 and 1976 respectively, describing their personal writing philosophies and their compulsions to put pen to paper, and offering an intriguing look inside the minds of both acclaimed writers.While you may not be familiar with these essays, or George Orwell and Joan Didion in general, discovering their “Why I Write” pieces proved to be a pivotal moment in my younger years. As a kid who grew up scribbling down thoughts in random spiral bound notebooks — rooted in the effort to capture how certain moments felt in addition to what they looked and sounded like, to create motion out of static words, to create a sense of preservation of perspective — the discovery of Orwell’s and Didion’s self-examinations, written as poetically as their narrative pieces, was groundbreaking.For the time being, I’ll offer a brief overview to save you the trouble of running off to read them, though I do recommend you eventually take a look. George Orwell’s “Why I Write” highlights moments from his childhood that made him realize he’d forever be compelled to write, even as he fought the urge for much of his early adulthood. He breaks his reasoning down into four clear reasons: sheer egoism, aesthetic enthusiasm, historical impulse and political purpose. He notes how these reasons “exist in different degrees in every writer, and in any one writer the proportions will vary from time to time,” but he explains these as the general principles that motivate writing.Meanwhile, in Joan Didion’s “Why I Write,” which she openly professes as an ode to Orwell’s, Didion leaves her reasoning more open-ended and emotive. She explains how she knew she was a writer when she was always paying attention to the periphery — the way leaves fell from the tree out the window, the smell of the Greyhound bus on her daily commute, the way certain streetlights became sinister in the evening — rather than strictly focusing on ideas. Famously, Didion framed it as, “I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means.”Although these essays may speak to me in particular due to my personal predilection for pen and paper, reading them for the first time struck a deeper chord within me, outside of personal like or dislike. The essays capture, and poignantly describe, the universality of writing — taking it down from its often academic pedestal and putting it on the ground as an everyday method of making sense of everyday life.These essays emphasize the commonality of the urge to tell a story — to feel important, to immortalize a memory, to make something beautiful — and illustrate how this desire stems from the same place inside of all of us. Whether we’re sitting at a big oak desk in an office in New York City or hunched in a beanbag chair in a college dorm, the desire to write, and what we can get out of it, remains the same.But do people actually write? Do college students in particular take the time to write for writing's sake, rather than to continue spinning on the assignment wheel? And is it worth it to take the time in our busy days to slow down and write journal entries, silly poems or lists from the day?In this situation, I side with Vonnegut — everyone would be a little bit better if they wrote a little bit more. As college students, writing is a tool we already use everyday. Unlike other forms of expression — say sculpting masterpieces or playing concertos — it’s a muscle we flex on demand for classes in the form of memos, lab reports and discussion posts. So to extend it a little further, to write for the sake of writing, for this universal “Why I Write,” isn’t too far out of our reach.Even if you don’t possess the same attention to the periphery as Joan Didion or desire to feel clever like George Orwell, I suggest that you give writing a second glance. In a world often bracketed with misinformation and distrust, days succumbed to a sense of speeding up without end and an increasing need for kindness within communities, writing can be the best way to slow down, get to know yourself a little better and decide what you really want, believe or value. So, write a poem, make a to-do list, journal about your crush or what you learned in lecture. Invest in your own life — and dare to think about something twice! Like Vonnegut said, you can only think as well as you write. And we all could use a little more clarity in our lives, right?Samantha George is a Trinity junior.

Jazz as a way of life,Luke A. Powery,2025-03-31T10:00:00Z,Mar,31,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/jazz-as-a-way-of-life-20250331.html,"For a little more than ten years, Duke Chapel has held a Jazz Vespers worship service once a semester. This service — a collaboration between Duke Chapel and the Duke Jazz Program — combines the ancient form of evening vespers with the musical improvisation of jazz. Periodically, we have special guest musicians. In February, we had saxophonist Branford Marsalis and pianist Joey Calderazzo. They did not disappoint as the elegant sounds of “The Bard Lachrymose,” “La Valse Kendall” and “Eternal” echoed off the walls and into our hearts. The service also included poetry by our very own Duke poets Tsitsi Ella Jaji and Crystal Simone Smith, as well as scripture readings and prayers.There are so many moments that were moving that evening, but one stands out to me that says something about the nature of jazz. Before the service started, I was touching base with Branford Marsalis about the anticipated flow of things, and I noted that the lyrics and music of the final hymn, “Just a Closer Walk with Thee,” were printed in the bulletin. When I showed it to him, he affirmed that they were going to play it, but as he looked at the notes on the page, he added, “But not like that.” I chuckled and knew what he meant. Marsalis was signaling that the notes on the page were not the music. The written notes and bars presented a visual structure, and perhaps even a compass of sorts, but the music was going to be made off the page through the sound of the saxophone and piano. He was indicating that they would play off of the given structure. There might have been some constraints, but they were free. And that is a key component of jazz — improvisation. When we came to that final hymn in the service, we sang the first two verses with the accompaniment of the musicians and then paused to thank the guest musicians and poets for their presence and gifts. And then, instead of singing the third and final verse, the gathered community sang the hymn’s refrain a cappella one last time as some people swayed and clapped with eyes wide open or closed. We all improvised that evening.In January, my colleague Professor Patrick Smith, associate research professor of theological ethics and bioethics at Duke Divinity School, gave the Trent Humanities in Medicine Lecture at Duke on the topic of “Jazz and Medical Ethics: Reflections from an Imperfect Art.” In that lecture, he described how jazz includes syncopation, polyphony, call-and-response, dissonance, and improvisation. He went on in his address to apply these principles to the practice of medicine.Jazz can also be applied to the practice of life. This is what I mean. As a musical genre, jazz is a bricolage of sorts, consisting of various elements, influences, styles, sounds, rhythms, cultures and more. Jazz is not just one pure thing; instead, it is made up of numerous things, whatever one has at hand in the moment to make music. Isn’t this like our human existence? In any given moment, we live in a bricolage of consonance, dissonance, syncopation, harmony, legato and staccato, adagio and allegro time. We live in joy and sorrow, love and animosity, truth and lies. And through these experiences, we construct a life. We make music. We play jazz existentially. French social anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss said that the artist ""shapes the beautiful and useful out of the dump heap of human life."" Life can pile on heaps of cow manure, and so we improvise because we have to. When someone dies in a tragic car accident or a rock-climbing accident—or your parents get a divorce or you end a friendship or you have to shift directions as an institution, like Duke, due to a strategic realignment and cost reduction process — it is necessary to learn how to improvise. Every day the sun rises and sets. This is an elemental structure of our day. It gives a frame with some constraints for our time, yet within that frame, there is freedom to make the necessary music required in any given moment — to perform a jazz riff. In life, you will experience consonance, dissonance, syncopation, crescendos and decrescendos, and more, but how will you respond creatively in the moment? How will you play jazz?The Rev. Dr. Luke A.

Harvard and MIT are making more students tuition-free. What about Duke?,Shambhavi Sinha,2025-03-31T10:00:00Z,Mar,31,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/harvard-mit-tuition-free-duke-20250331.html,"Harvard College recently announced that it will be “free for students from families with annual incomes of $100,000 or less and tuition-free for students from families with annual incomes of $200,000 or less.” MIT also announced that students whose family income is under $200,000 a year will be attending tuition-free 2025-26 onwards.⁠ Not much prior, Duke’s Board of Trustees approved a 5.93% increase in the undergraduate cost of attendance for the 2025-26 academic year. It is not problematic for a university to increase its cost of attendance, of course. Even a simple economic viewpoint necessitates keeping up with inflation and other costs. However, for several years now, Duke has reported the third-highest tuition in the Ivy+, trailing behind only Columbia and the University of Chicago. While recent initiatives like the expansion of financial aid for low-income students from North Carolina and South Carolina should be celebrated, these must be contextualized as a toddler’s first steps when placed next to the miles other universities are walking. Duke remains one of the few institutions of its kind not to make engaged efforts to join the fray of fully need-blind admissions: a process that emphasizes a university’s belief in accepting students of merit, not just of means. It remains one of the least socioeconomically diverse undergraduate institutions in the bracket. This is reflected in social activities and academic interests here on the daily. From flying to Europe on a whim for spring break, to dropping thousands to find friends in Greek Life organizations, many activities that make the “Duke Experience” are outcomes of mind-boggling wealth and connections. And while the “infamous” New York Times article was written in 2023, even two years later, the truth holds: the DukeLIFE room, nested in the third floor of Perkins, the floor of frat and finance bros, remains empty. Its emptiness shines the continued shame and lack of acceptance on this campus to associate with such identities. It seems like economic diversity became a blind spot in the other countless diversity measures that Duke was targeting. This is even though the notion of economic diversity continues to be a bi-partisan haven in an era of rapid polarization and stigmatization of any word even close to diversity. Of course, Duke is diverse in many ways: I have met a variety of people from countless identities and cultures. Yet there is one thing apart from our Duke education that connects most students: economic wealth. So when this connection is broken by students who’ve crossed these “unbreakable” barriers, their existence alone on this campus redefines what it means to be a Duke student. We bring our unique lived experiences to the intellectual discourse on this campus, reflect our identities into social activities, and innovate based on notions that someone with economic privilege might have never thought about. By admitting students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, Duke has the potential to change the trajectories of entire families. When it continues to gatekeep itself as an education exclusively for students with economic means, it loses the opportunity to be changed and redefined by magnificent, intellectually driven and curious students whose only misfortune was not being born with a silver spoon and a trust fund.In the newest and “most ambitious fundraising campaign in its history,” Made For This, Duke claims that it has audacious goals for the future: with pillars in science and technology, student experience, climate and health. This campaign is the first of its kind since 2017, and is unique in the sense that no campaign goal is publicly announced, unlike the $3.25 billion target of Duke Forward (which was exceeded by $0.6 billion). The student experience pillar of the campaign emphasizes “encouraging rich exploration across disciplines,” creating the “highest level of academic excellence,” and ensuring the “best and brightest students” thrive at Duke. The commitment to improving student access to a university slowly inching to a $100,000-per-year cost of attendance is not as central as it should be, instead emphasizing the (long due) update to the curriculum and expectedly, QuadEx. This is disheartening, especially considering some of the university’s major donors, like David Rubenstein, were from working-class backgrounds and had scholarships that made their Duke experience possible. If the students Duke has invested in years back are now returning their investment in countless multipliers, why is there such a hazy focus on investing more to improve access? If Duke wants its students to innovate and flourish like Harvard, or the other Ivies, why doesn’t it voice or even target the same commitments that these institutions are making?Brown fully covers tuition for families earning $125,000 or less with typical assets. Princeton covers tuition, room and board for families that earn up to $100,000 annually. These examples are not anomalies, because there are countless other institutions better than and on par with Duke’s caliber providing these offerings. When other universities deliver on promises to level the playing field, create broader experiences and meaning to their student bodies, it hurts. Does Duke not value the students who have crossed the many disparities brought on by class, income, and lifestyle? Do they not deserve to have a larger hold in shaping what is the “Duke Experience?” Or should we all just stay mum, locked up in our dorms over spring break? Or should we spend what little we have on overpriced merch and the running expenditures of tenting? Or go into debt to be in Greek Life, just to fit in socially? And if you say that is not what the Duke Experience is about, then what is? Even beyond the sociocultural scene that molds the Duke Experience, academic life here is also shaped by socioeconomic experiences. When I was applying to college, it was incredibly reassuring to me to see financial aid information like this from institutions I dreamed of. It signaled their want for students of all backgrounds, not just those who could regularly afford to pay a five-digit sticker price every semester, especially one that is now increasing at almost twice the rate of inflation. When I was accepted to Duke, I was overjoyed and grateful for its financial support. But how does one make up the ease of academic pursuit fueled by years of personal attention, private school counseling and college consultants? I felt like my peers had everything and more figured out, while I struggled to shove myself into the mold of being a Blue Devil. And this is not just a singular experience: students from middle-class families suffer even more, grappling with the less-than-generous financial aid that compels them to finance their endeavors through multiple on and off-campus jobs. You hear these struggles in muffled whispers and mutters in the corners of Vondy because sometimes, it feels like not being rich here is simply not an option. Duke desperately needs the lives and lived experiences of a variety of students. It also needs to commit itself to empowering the students who make it what it is. There are Blue Devils and their parents who are working hard to finance the educational opportunity of a lifetime, and there is so much more that we can do to support them. If we want Blue Devils to change the world, we need to give them the resources to do so. Shambhavi Sinha is a Trinity sophomore."

We are confident in Tara’s capability to reach across disciplines, communicate with various student groups and hear the voices of those in the Pratt School of Engineering. Engineering Student Government aims to improve several aspects of college life for engineering students, from academic affairs and social life to club participation and industry experiences. Tara’s extensive experience on DSG, especially in the campus outreach sector, has demonstrated that she will be a fantastic candidate dedicated to improving the day-to-day lives of Duke students. Seeing as we students are here on campus for such a short, yet profoundly impactful, portion of our lives, we enthusiastically commend Tara’s efforts and goals to include Pratt voices in conversations, both on the campus grounds and in more administratively centered policy discussions. Tara has made it clear that she understands the concerns of Pratt students and is willing to elevate those to find solutions. As elected representatives of the engineering community, ESG’s role is to advocate for student needs and support candidates who further that mission.

Degrees of fiction,Barbara Cardenas,2025-03-30T10:00:00Z,Mar,30,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/degrees-of-fiction-20250330.html,"In high school, I was sure I’d study economics and political science. That’s what I wrote on my Duke application. It sounded solid. Smart. Useful. I figured I’d keep the creative stuff (music, writing, storytelling) on the side. Not because I didn’t love it, but because I didn’t think I was allowed to center it. Not if I wanted to be taken seriously.By the time I got to Duke, the plan shifted slightly. I dropped political science, swapped in a minor in visual and media studies, and set my sights on economics. Still structured, still practical, but with a little room for self-expression.And then something started to shift.It wasn’t a dramatic revelation, no mid-lecture epiphany or teary conversation. Just a slow, quiet realization that I was most myself when I was writing. I’d spend hours tweaking a sentence in an essay, not because I had to, but because I wanted to. I’d underline the same line in a poem again and again because it said something I hadn’t known how to say yet. There was a kind of electricity in that feeling, and I couldn’t ignore it.So, halfway through sophomore year, I declared English.That choice came with a quiet kind of guilt. I immediately paired it with psychology, not just because I was interested in it (though I was), but because it gave me structure. It gave me options. It made the English part sound like less of a risk. And as an international student, it gave me three years of OPT (the work authorization that would let me stay in the U.S. after graduation). Still, I knew which major I cared more about. And it wasn’t the one I used to justify myself.There’s this unspoken hierarchy at schools like Duke. Some paths are easier to explain to your parents, your peers, to strangers at a dinner table. Certain majors command respect the moment you name them and seem to carry more weight. Others require a follow-up explanation, a second sentence, a little smile to suggest you’re self-aware. English often falls in the second category. Add in the fact that I’m a singer-songwriter and suddenly I’m two for two in “dreamer energy.”But here’s what I’ve come to believe (and what I think more people should say out loud): studying literature, language and storytelling is one of the most serious things a person can do.Writing is serious. Choosing the right word is serious. Cutting what doesn’t serve the story? Very serious. So is reading closely. Thinking critically. Asking better questions. Understanding the difference between what something says and what it means. These aren’t “soft” skills. They’re the foundation of how we communicate, how we process the world, how we create meaning out of chaos.And if you happen to be an artist, those skills are everything.I didn’t expect my English classes to shape my songwriting as much as they did, but they kept creeping in. A lyric I wrote last semester came straight from a discussion about metaphor and how silence can speak just as loudly as sound. Reading Kokinshū poetry made me think differently about brevity and suggestion, how leaving space in a line can make it hit harder. And when we read “Never Let Me Go”by Kazuo Ishiguro, I couldn’t stop thinking about how tenderness and devastation can exist in the same sentence. That feeling found its way into a song without me even trying. Eventually, I stopped seeing a line between my academic work and my creative work. They weren’t separate, they were feeding each other the whole time.And I know I’m not the only one. Even if I weren’t a songwriter, I think I’d still feel this way, because most English majors I know don’t just study literature, they live with it. We’re the ones reading with a pencil in hand, underlining furiously, writing little notes in the margins like the author might write back. The ones who gasp mid-sentence, or pause to reread a line five times because it just gets us. We’ve all had those 2 a.m. moments, not (always) because a paper was due, but because we were chasing the right words and couldn’t let it go.And Duke’s English department never treats that passion like something small. They make it known that paying close attention — to language, to emotion, to meaning — matters.I’ve had professors who treat sentences like architecture: something you build and rebuild until it finally holds. Who ask the hard questions not to trip you up, but to help you go deeper. Who talk about language with so much passion it makes you fall in love with it all over again. They took my writing seriously before I did. They reminded me that paying close attention is an act of care. That what we do here matters.I used to think English would always have to be secondary. I thought choosing something creative meant giving up the “real” plan. But the more I leaned into it, the more I realized: this was the real plan all along.And no, it’s not always easy to explain. It doesn’t come with a built-in career path or a flashy internship title. But it gave me something better: a voice. And the confidence to use it.So if you’ve ever felt the need to justify your major or your creative path or the thing you love that doesn’t fit cleanly into a box, I hope you know you’re not alone. You don’t need to make it make sense for anyone else.You just have to choose it.And that choice? It’s anything but fiction.Barbara Cardenas is a Trinity senior."
The final countdown,Anna Garziera,2025-03-30T10:00:00Z,Mar,30,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/final-countdown-20250330.html,"It’s late March. The birds are chirping. The flowers are blooming. Students all over the country are counting down the days — only a month left until the end of school.Amidst our chatter, we repeat the same familiar phrases. Are you ready for the final sprint? Here comes the home stretch! Only a little bit left. How many days? This many days. Geez — I just can’t wait.At the same time, there are lots of things to attend to. We students are pestered with questions about summer plans. But until internship offers arrive at the end of April, our summer months remain a question mark. We’d like to know, to have that sense of security. But we don’t. Then, there’s finals. They’re creeping up too close for comfort. Soon, our classmates will start nudging our elbows: “Do you feel ready for the final? Have you started studying yet?”We plough on. We don’t have a choice — if we’re ahead, we must work to stay ahead and beat the curve. And if we’re behind, we’re trying to catch up. Full of adrenaline, we run towards this final month at full force. Unsurprisingly, this is the time when the good habits and routines we’ve built up throughout the year fall apart. We stop going to the Wilson gym in the morning. We take fewer walks in the Duke Gardens. We stop calling our moms.There just isn’t enough time for everything. If it were only that the end of the semester brings the last few midterms and the first few finals, we’d be okay. We could handle that much. But sports teams are getting ready for end-of-season races. There’s March Madness and Eball and LDOC. And on top of everything, the weather’s nice, and it’s a pity not to spend time “studying” in the grass.How to balance it all? It’s not easy. And no amount of motivation will fix it. Blog moms will tell you to stick to your nighttime routine, eat a balanced diet and get eight hours of sleep. But reality is, even the best of us see those good habits unravel once exam season starts.Instead, I’ll give you some gentler and more realistic advice: To keep going strong until the end, you have to give in to some of your desires.I know how you think of yourself — an unbendable soldier. But you don’t always have to prove yourself. Once the toast hits the floor — jam-side-down — you can start lending yourself some grace. You should let yourself use more food points than you normally would and treat yourself to JB's cheesecake or buy a matcha from Bella. You should study with friends on BC Plaza even if you’re less productive. You should keep going to events you’re interested in. You should let your mind wander and dream about the summer, next year, and the future. Put some music on. Close your eyes. Kick back in a comfy chair. Perhaps just get some work done beforehand.You should take advantage of spring, for it only comes once a year. Take a walk in the gardens and gaze at the cherry blossoms. Then, fine, go back to studying. But have something fulfilling to think back on when you’re going to bed. It’s easy to forget, but our sanity is as crucial to our success as our studying. Completing side-quests after class, spending time with friends on the quad, attending tennis practice and organizing a roommate’s birthday party are not a waste of time. These activities keep us happy and healthy. Finals are important, but so is rest. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Even if you feel pressured to go hard now because you’ll have three months of summer to relax and recover (which — let’s be honest — with internships, jobs and summer classes, you probably won’t) you mustn’t underestimate this last month of school. It’s easy to fall into the sprint and go all out too early. Don’t fly and die.At first, giving in to everyday pleasures will feel like a waste of time. It isn’t. The happier you are, the easier you’ll find it to stick to those good morning routines and study habits. Operating as usual will feel less of a burden. There’s plenty of hours left until your finals — use them well. But don’t use all of them well, or you’ll end up losing your mind even before we cross the finish line.Anna Garziera is a Trinity sophomore. Her pieces typically run on alternate Sundays."

Her emphasis on action items that nurture the physical, social, civic and financial wellness of the student body will serve to bolster Mi Gente’s mission of fostering the cultural, political and educational enrichment of the Duke Latinx community. Through her extensive experience and actualization of past promises as vice president of campus life, Tara exhibits an unapologetic commitment to fulfilling her responsibilities to the Duke student body and holding herself and those in leadership accountable. In Tara, we see a leader who will remain honest and steadfast in her accountability to cultural groups like Mi Gente, the Duke Latinx community and all undergraduate students on Duke’s campus. Mi Gente would like to thank Katelyn Cai for her many ideas to make DSG more approachable and transparent. We look forward to working with the future DSG president and encourage our members to inform themselves on all candidates’ platforms. Signed, Mariana Meza, Trinity ‘26, Mi Gente President"
It’s time for the left to reclaim free speech,Leo Goldberg,2025-03-28T10:00:00Z,Mar,28,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/time-for-left-reclaim-free-speech-20250328.html,"By now, we’ve all read of the disturbing case of Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student at Columbia University who was detained by federal immigration authorities a few weeks ago for daring to criticize Israel. Khalil, who had been an avid activist on Columbia’s campus and organizer of the pro-Palestinian protests that shook the campus over the last year, was to President Donald Trump's administration an ideological threat which, in their national purge of dissent, could not be tolerated. The video of Khalil’s arrest, which I recommend watching here, is nothing short of chilling. Immigration officials arrive at Khalil’s dorm, handcuff him without stating the charges for arrest, refuse to answer the questions of his wife and their lawyer and drive away in an unmarked SUV. The scene was something straight out of the Gestapo. Khalil’s detention is the first case of the kidnapping and disappearance of a political dissident by the Trump administration, but it won’t be the last. The very essence of free speech in America is now imperiled by Trump’s deliberate silencing and threatening of political adversaries of every kind who speak out against him. The South African Ambassador to the U.S. has been expelled by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who accused him of being “a race-baiting politician who hates America and hates [Trump].” A French scientist was recently denied entry into the U.S. after his phone was searched and found to contain messages critical of Trump. An executive order was issued last week to shut down Voice of America, an international radio news service originally founded during WWII to counter Nazi propaganda, for being “anti-Trump.” People of the United States: Everywhere the alarm bells of fascism are sounding. The current jeopardy posed to the First Amendment by Trump has been enabled by a widespread misconception which in recent years has found currency in the mainstream American political arena: that free speech is a value of the political right. Conservatives in America have maintained a calculated campaign to present themselves as the great defenders of free speech, a bastion of liberty against the oppressive forces of liberal wokeism (what does this term even mean?).This concerted effort has been especially effective when it comes to college campuses. Demagogues like Charlie Kirk have made a hucksterish political killing off of touring universities proclaiming to stand up for the rights of those who think differently on issues particularly regarding the opportunistically-fabricated phenomenon of a “culture war.” At Duke, the designated campus group that “advances freedom of speech” and “promotes civil discourse” is the Ciceronian Society, a right-of-center student organization which has likewise assumed the great crusade of defending free speech under the guise that this value is empowered by the right. The group invokes the name of free speech and claims to promote its presence on campus while simultaneously hosting speakers like Allen West, who suggested Trump should go as far as to arrest and jail Democratic governors who refuse to comply with his national plans. Within the context of Trump’s actions, the right’s claim to be the guardians of free speech in America is nonsense, and no one should be fooled into believing the First Amendment is stronger because of their efforts. Threatening freedom of the press, banning books and erasing entire sections of history for asserting the existence of minorities is not free speech. Conceding such a premise, as has been done in America in recent years, has directly led to the constitutional crisis with which we are now faced. But the conservative hijacking of free speech is as much a political failure of the left as a con job of the right. Over the last few years, liberals in America have turned away from their rich historical tradition of defending free speech, which up until recently had been a cornerstone of classical liberal thought and progressive movements for centuries. Free speech was not too long ago ardently championed by the left as a means of fighting against reactionary political power, and was crucial in cases like the protests against the war in Vietnam and in promoting civil rights. The left has now decided to repudiate this honorable legacy, and it’s worth understanding why.The rise of the pathetic, xenophobic, hate-filled movement of Trump created a desire on the left to defend and maintain the plurality of America and ensure that hate speech exists only in the extreme fringes of society where it belongs. But the execution of these goals, however noble their intentions may or may not have been, was done in so botched a way as to actually degrade freedom further. Vapid political ideas originating from identity politics in which race, gender or sexual orientation became a means for disqualifying certain people from their right to speak to such issues began to take precedence among progressives especially. Individuals began to be subdivided into the categories of the oppressor and the oppressed. Those belonging to the former, once deemed as such, were shut down from contributing to the debate.Unsurprisingly, the mainstream promotion of such practices has had a chilling effect, causing many people to think twice about expressing an opinion out of fear of retaliation. The majority of Americans came to recognize the intellectual laziness and obnoxiousness of this policing of political discourse, with 62% of adults saying that “people being too easily offended by things others say” is a major problem in the country today. Demagogues like Tucker Carlson and Dennis Prager eagerly rushed to fill the resulting vacuum of honest discourse. There once existed a vibrant class of liberal intellectuals who championed free speech as the means of rightly exposing the sordid corruption of the status quo, people like Edward Said, Noam Chomsky, Christopher Hitchens and others. But that generation of freethinkers is dead or dying. Author Salman Rushdie, who knows a thing or two about the dangers of sacrificing free speech, remarked on the current state of these affairs, “Freedom, and in particular freedom of expression, is everywhere under attack — from reactionary authoritarian populist demagogic half-educated narcissistic careless voices. Places of education and libraries are subject to hostility and censorship. And there are also progressive voices being raised in favor of a new kind of censorship, one which appears virtuous, and which many people, especially young people, have begun to see as a virtue. So freedom is under pressure from both the left and the right, the young as well as the old.” It’s time for the left to take back the values of free speech and dissent, and provide a haven for its existence. This reclamation, to which Rushdie alluded, should start on college campuses. Universities in America have stopped being looked upon as places of rigorous discourse, instead becoming one-sided, intellectually-devoid “safe spaces.” Of course, there should be individual places at all universities for students to go and find community. These resources can be essential forms of belonging and much-needed relief for students on campus. But colleges as a whole are not, and shouldn’t be, safe spaces. They should be battlegrounds for ideas and contrasting ideologies, fueled by lively debate and exchanges of ideas. Anything less would be betraying the concept of higher education.Famous liberal free-thinker Thomas Paine once remarked, “He who dares not offend cannot ever be honest.” University students on the left must heed Paine’s words. Rather than shunning the voices of those on the political right, or asserting that certain political positions can be grounds for dismissal of discourse, open debate should be pursued and encouraged thoughtfully in classes, extracurriculars and day-to-day conservations. The student on campus who voices an unpopular opinion is the one who should have their viewpoint protected most. When encountering dissent of this kind, we should recognize that the presence of that dissenting opinion makes us stronger and think more critically. Diversity entails more than just race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. Much more importantly, it entails the diversity of thought, and a wide spectrum of different political and social ideas. The forces of censorship are threatening our country not just from the right, but from the left too. Now more than ever, as Trump and the acquiescent right employ the destructive combination of destroying free speech while claiming to be its protector, it is the moral obligation of liberals, especially young liberal college students, to re-embrace the principles on which left-wing movements bravely fought past injustice. Freedom of speech and expression unequivocally cannot be trusted in the guardianship of the right, that much is clear. It is now up to us college students to decide if it can be trusted in the guardianship of the left. Leo Goldberg is a Trinity first-year. His pieces typically run on alternate Mondays."
The privilege to care about your CV,Annie Ming Kowalik,2025-03-27T10:00:00Z,Mar,27,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/privilege-care-about-cv-20250327.html,"I watch as my aunt washes out single-serve yogurt containers and stacks them neatly in her cupboard. Peering over my writing, I observe as she chops spring onion for our dinner, collecting the leftover root stubs to bury in a dirt tray she keeps in the front entryway, already thick with new shoots. I pull open the unfamiliar cupboards in search of a mug and find bags within bags of plastic bags, neatly washed and folded. There is an instinct in me to scorn the unnecessary frugality of it all, for they have long since been able to afford fresh vegetables whenever, and there might be 50 yogurt containers that will reside in the cupboard, never to be repurposed. My aunt laughs, perhaps to excuse herself. “很土” she smiles sheepishly (translation: unsophisticated, backward). In that moment I stare at her hands — red and cracked from years of hard work. In that moment, I think of how terribly backward I have it all. Because if anything is unsophisticated, it must be my problems, the kind that feel urgent and all-consuming within the walls of a place like Duke, yet fade to insignificance in the face of real hardship.On campus, some of the most discussed issues revolve around our next summer internship and the relentless chase for prestige. Success is something to be optimized, every moment a stepping stone toward a future defined by LinkedIn updates and industry placements. It’s a world where we agonize over interview prep and networking strategies as if our lives depend on them. And as we all know, this life isn’t easy. But this life — my comfortable, structured, well-supported life — is incomparably easy compared to what my aunt, my mother and my father went through.When my aunt was my age, she volunteered to be sent to the Chinese countryside under Mao’s policies, taking her older brother’s place so he wouldn’t have to go. He was the family’s “darling boy,” and she, being the eldest girl, 12 years older than my mom, was expected to sacrifice. She doesn’t talk much about the grueling labor, earning just 64 yuan (an equivalent of 17.87 USD converted for purchasing power parity) in an entire year, or how she found a way to leverage the system of rewarding laborers by studying agriculture and earning a degree.My aunt doesn’t seem to mind that once she arrived in America, she gave up a position as an adjunct professor to be closer to home — working as a parking attendant. When I ask her why she’s so nonchalant about the sacrifice, she laughs again and tells me that working in the countryside was the hardest thing she’s ever done, and no other tragedy will ever compare. Like her, my parents also knew what it meant to start over with nothing — not even the comfort of language, familiarity or safety.When my dad was 13, he and my grandmother fled Soviet-controlled Poland. He spent time in a refugee camp in Italy before finally making it to Canada, where he worked to put himself through college, eventually earning a master’s degree in mathematics. When my mother was 21, she left China with two suitcases, realizing that neither the law nor journalism she had studied could change the system around her. At 21, she re-entered high school, learning English, just to give herself a fighting chance in college. I daresay her English is better than mine, and I’ve grown up speaking it. It is so easy to forget that those who came here with nothing, not even language, have had it a hundred times harder than I will ever have it. My struggles are real, but they are relative. I have the privilege of worrying about which path I will take, not whether I will have one at all.I can’t help but reflect on how narrow my definition of personal success has been. All my role models have done great things: built careers, led organizations and changed industries. But I can think of nothing greater than surviving some of the hardest working conditions, escaping, and somehow, against all odds, building a life for yourself and your family. That is courage. That is perseverance. That is a kind of success no résumé bullet point will ever capture.Take a walk through the city. The world isn’t just held together by people with degrees from top 25 universities. It’s held together by those who labor unseen. The parents who work blue-collar jobs to raise their children. Our lovely WU hospitality workers who work three jobs and attend community college. The amateur musician playing saxophone in a dimly lit bar. The artist who paints murals in the back of alleyways because they believe in creating beauty even when no one is watching.At Duke, we are taught to maximize every opportunity, to optimize our time, to view success as something that can be neatly packaged into a résumé. And sometimes we make the mistake of trying to fit all of our success into that one page, although it is so much more than that. We should recognize that the privilege of caring about our CVs, the privilege of choice, is one that few ever get to have.Before we chase the next great thing, we should take a moment to reflect on the people who got us here. The ones who gave up everything, their careers, their homes, their countries, so that we could sit in lecture halls and debate what success even means.Maybe that means calling your parents. Asking them about the stories they don’t have a chance to tell. Maybe that means going to see your elders in Minnesota during spring break while you still can.That reminds me — I’m going to go call my grandma now.Annie Ming Kowalik is a Pratt sophomore and a visiting international student from the University of New South Wales.

Where have all the backpacks gone?,Juliette Workman,2025-03-26T10:00:00Z,Mar,26,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/where-are-all-the-backpacks-20250326.html,"Last semester, I started to develop a peculiar ache in my right shoulder.Initially, I attributed this lopsided pain to a multitude of things that come with the freshman experience: Maybe I wasn’t acclimated to my new dorm mattress yet. Maybe orchestra left more tension than I realized. Or maybe, after a summer free of assignments, my right arm just wasn't ready for the return of frantic scribbling. Whatever the reason I came up with in my head, it was in denial of the fact that there was a very clear reason I was having issues — my purse. After seeing how popular shoulder bags were on campus, I retired my burgundy key-chained Kankën backpack from high school and began carrying all my school supplies (laptop, iPad, notebook, pens, gum, lip gloss and more) in a large gray leather tote. Even though I didn’t have a specific personal justification, I was quick to make this change when I noticed that shoulder bags were a prolific choice amongst female students in my classes. I vividly remember sitting in Econ 101D, Economic Principles, during the second week of school and marveling at a peer who was able to fit her laptop, iPad, change of gym clothes, running shoes, and large makeup bag, all in her medium Longchamp Le Pliage tote. It was at that moment that I decided that if she could do it, so could I. My shoulder bag made more sense with my outfits than my bulky backpack, and made me feel more put-together. Being a tote bag girl was empowering — until I started feeling the woes of its inconvenience. Before coming to college, I had envisioned backpacks as quintessential characters to the four-year story, only to be parted with at graduation and replaced with a shoulder bag upon entering the “real world.” Media centered around college students echoed this sentiment, with movies from “Good Will Hunting” to “Pitch Perfect” featuring main characters who sport backpacks throughout their university journey. Even college brochures and advertisements are filled with images of students and their backpacks, chatting on the quad or walking cheerfully to their classes. But coming to Duke shattered my preconceived notion that shoulder bags, satchels and briefcases were reserved for grad students and young professionals.Of course, backpacks are still used on campus. However, I had a serious case of fashion whiplash seeing such a saturation of all kinds of bags but backpacks. Sometimes, people didn’t even bring a bag to class at all, and carried their laptop free. These patterns in fashion make sense at competitive, pre-professional and career-focused schools like Duke, where progressions from student to young professional are blurred. As an incoming student, you are immediately in a constant state of focus on your future. Whether it's hearing your colleagues during O-Week already talking about landing an internship for the next summer, or doomscrolling on LinkedIn (if you made one already), you are immediately thrown into coffee chat mode upon your arrival to campus.I am not saying that being ambitious, driven or competitive is bad. After all, providing a platform for our careers is why many of us chose Duke in the first place. However, I think the impact that the unique Duke culture has on the freshman psyche is interesting, and for me reflected both in my fashion choices and my mindset. Just as I wasn't exactly sure why I switched from my bright backpack to a more professional-looking tote, I wasn’t exactly sure why I skipped orchestra to go to a rush event for a business fraternity I wasn’t actually passionate about. When my right shoulder began to ache from carrying the weight of my tote bag during my first semester, I was simultaneously beginning to feel burnt out under the pressure of the Duke student atmosphere. Although my colleague in ECON 101D seemed to be fitting everything perfectly in a Longchamp, it may not be the most realistic choice for most class-goers. After my campus observations, I was quick to make the switch to a similar minimalist tote, and leave behind my colorful backpack that retained a sense of individuality and unseriousness. Despite being more “professional,” the tote holds less, is not super convenient, and while it makes me feel more put-together when I wear it, hides the expression I previously demonstrated in my colorful and adorned backpack. Accepting the fact that I was growing away from my backpack took a period of adjustment, but so did acclimating to the high-pressure nature of the Duke student community.As a second-semester freshman and proud rising sophomore, I’ve found ways to deal with burnout and embrace this pressure as a unique and motivating aspect of this institution. Instead of letting the shared sense of ambition on campus stress me out, I smile at how fortunate I am to attend a school where people are passionate, driven, and collaboratively work toward success. I don’t believe my change in mindset is succumbing to the pre-professional pressure, but rather, is accepting and acknowledging it. It is possible that I’ve grown out of being scared for the future or intimidated by comparison, and in this new semester, have started seeking out opportunities to advance my career despite fearing failure. Maybe, switching out of my backpack was another part of maturing for me.Even though my grown-up tote bag is heavy — I love it, and haven’t been able to make a consistent switch back to my high school backpack after incorporating it into my day-to-day. While I wish I hadn’t been consumed by stress about my future during my first semester, I am now at a place where I find the Duke culture more invigorating than intimidating. Looking back, my advice to the Class of 2029 would be to always remember that they are students first. In hindsight, keeping my backpack around a little longer might have saved me some initial stress and shoulder pain. Juliette Workman is a Trinity first-year. "
Why Duke is failing at being an elite institution,Krisha Patel,2025-03-25T10:00:00Z,Mar,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-failing-as-elite-institution-20250325.html,"Jan. 20 was an ugly day for elite institutions. On that day, President Donald Trump issued an executive order titled “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.” The order aimed to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within programs, policies and positions in the federal government.On Feb. 14, the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights sent an ultimatum letter to universities stating that it would start to take measures against race-based practices in “student, academic [and] campus life.” They would have two weeks to comply. In March, Trump initiated investigations that would target DEI practices at universities with over $1 billion in endowments, affecting over 50 schools. Duke was one of them. Many public universities that are reliant on federal spending were quick to fall in line with Trump’s new wave of executive orders. Their research and funding is more reliant on federal money compared to private universities. Student scholarships, financial aid and work-study loans are also reliant on federal money. But Duke, an institution with a $12.1 billion endowment is a slightly different case. Duke is an elite university, and all that prestige means that Duke should be more resilient to the Trump administration’s threats to higher education. But it’s not.Like other elite institutions, Duke overwhelmingly admits progressive students, students that are passionate about enacting social change and making a generational impact in politics and society. At the same time, students here are very rich. The median family income is $186,000, and 69% of students here come from the top 20%. This average family income is likely much higher, with 19% of students here in the top 1%. These demographics look a lot different at a non-elite institution, let alone a public institution. Both characteristics go hand in hand, with wealthier students having the financial sanctuary to feel comfortable enough advocating for progressive ideals and affording a school like Duke. There’s already a term coined for this group of students in higher education: the liberal elite. David Brooks, an opinion writer for the New York Times argues in his article, “The Sins of the Educated Class”, that the core of progressivism has shifted away from the working class and towards the liberal elite. He argues that this is problematic, as elite universities reinforce privilege, which is contradictory to the founding principles of progressivism. There are a lot of good points Brooks makes in his article, including that students at elite institutions are rarely exposed to diverse political beliefs, students here overwhelmingly matriculate to anti-progressive fields such as finance/consulting (which minimizes progressive impact) and that there are limited low-income voices. However, what Brooks ignores (as Duke does as well) is its role and ability to enact progress with the unique resources elite institutions have. Every year, Duke churns out 1,500 or more brilliant students who have undergone four years of a liberal arts education building them to lead, innovate, think across disciplines and be socially and globally aware. Since there are not enough jobs to maximize the potential of every Duke student, many of these students end up pursuing careers that offer good return on investment (ROI) and less-than-ideal social impact. The role of a good university is to provide a good ROI. The role of an elite institution is more than that. In his book “Excellent Sheep,” William Dieresiewicz, digs a little deeper into what a liberal arts education is meant to do. He argues that a university like Duke is meant to teach students to “learn how to think,” and more specifically, “liberate us from doxa by teaching us to recognize it, to question it, and to think around it.” Basically, these types of institutions are meant to teach us how to think for ourselves, individualize ourselves and always question what we know and what we can know. Duke doesn't fail here.At Duke, we have access to a wealth of resources — world-class professors, cutting-edge research, a vibrant intellectual community, diverse clubs, global experiences and a student body that brings a wide range of perspectives. Plus whatever else is on the university front page. So, what’s with the title? How is Duke failing?For a university that encourages us to think for ourselves, the university is doing a poor job in encouraging us to voice them. In times of political peril, it is imperative that the university stick to its role and continue to produce students that are ready to invoke change once they leave. But the university can’t do that if it attempts to silence students that try to make change while they’re here. In September, Duke enacted stricter policies regarding “pickets, protests and demonstrations” on campus, enforcing that all protests first be registered through Duke Groups. The university also micromanages the protests, having a say on where, when, how loud and how long the protests are. The ambiguity of the new policies combined with the harsh consequences of violating them discourages students from gathering to protest at Duke. Consequently, protests regarding certain issues at Duke occur considerably less frequently than peer institutions. Yet, an intro public policy class at Duke will preach and exemplify the importance of protest in catalyzing cultural, political and social progress. Here’s the dichotomy: The university is backing down in upholding the values it preaches when it expects its students to do the opposite in the real world. In response to the Trump administration’s regulations on DEI, Duke has made no apparent decisions, neither to stick to what it’s doing or to roll back its DEI initiatives. The Harvard Crimson has reported how Harvard’s president, Alam. M. Garber recently made a reaffirming statement regarding the importance of diversity at their annual DEI forum, adhering to their commitment to DEI. The dean at Georgetown Law has targeted the Trump administration, stating that “the government cannot direct what Georgetown and its faculty teach” in accordance with the First Amendment. Other institutions such as Yale and the University of Connecticut are looking for legal loopholes to protect their DEI initiatives. Duke’s silence means something. This is not to say that Duke faces zero risk.In 2018, the NIH (National Institute of Health) awarded $41 billion to universities and the NSF (National Science Foundation) awarded $11.2 billion. In January, the Office of Management and Budget sent out a memo suspending all financial assistance for any kind of research from both organizations. The point of the suspension was to provide the administration with time to investigate whether the research being done on issues such as climate change and DEI aligned with President Trump’s agenda. The memo was rescinded two days later, but the threat remains, and funding is still delayed. Duke, like many public universities, also receives a considerable amount of money from the federal government. Federal institutions like the NSF and NIH funded over 64% of Duke’s research budget in 2024. For every dollar a researcher receives from a grant, Duke charges 61 cents to help cover overhead costs and construct the infrastructure necessary to support these projects. Trump wants to cut funding for “indirect costs” by bringing the rate down from 61% to 15%. There’s a lot at stake if Duke chooses to ignore the Trump administration's new wave of executive orders. There seems to be a general consensus among the anti-elite on the far right that elite universities are undeserving of their prestige and need to be more heavily scrutinized for their internal spending, race-based practices and curriculums. The current administration is bound to take further measures to suppress higher education, whether this be more funding cuts, restrictions on what can be taught and researched or regulations on how the university is to spend its money. What matters is that Duke doesn’t blindly adhere to every rule, risking the loss of its core values and liberal arts mission within the next four years.So, how do we use our resources as an elite institution to allow our students to make change while not losing these resources under Trump’s crackdown on elite institutions?We can’t, but at the same time, the university needs to lead its students by example. This situation isn’t just about DEI but about whether the university is capable of sticking to the ideals when they’re put on trial. The only way for Duke to remain an elite institution is not by maintaining its mass of wealth but by using it to drive its students and faculty to make an impact in social justice. If we don’t stick to our commitment to global impact, then all we are is an institution that reinforces privilege — by accepting wealthy students and placing them in high-paying jobs with no progress towards distributive justice. If not an institution strong enough for the elites, what is Duke’s role?Krisha Patel is a Trinity first-year."
Beyond quick fixes: Rethinking crisis response in an interconnected world,Jakob Hagedorn,2025-03-24T10:00:00Z,Mar,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/rethinking-crisis-response-interconnected-world-20250324.html,"Russia’s war against Ukraine, the ongoing conflict in Gaza, the COVID-19 pandemic and the escalating climate issues and biodiversity losses — we live in a world of interconnected crises: a polycrisis.As Duke students, we live in a bubble that sometimes makes this seem like an abstract concept. But it isn’t: it impacts where we study, conduct research and build our futures. Climate change isn't a distant issue when hurricanes devastate communities in North Carolina. COVID-19 disrupted the academic learning and mental health of millions of students. Economic instability isn't theoretical when inflation directly affects tuition and job opportunities. Additionally, as privileged and educated individuals, we have an ethical responsibility to recognize and actively address these injustices.Yet, many of us still approach crises as temporary hurdles rather than systemic challenges requiring long-term solutions. By recognizing the interconnected nature of these problems, we can begin developing solutions that extend beyond quick fixes.How today’s crises interconnectTo understand this entanglement, we can examine the COVID-19 pandemic. Global research efforts, including contributions from Duke, have identified that the SARS-CoV-2 virus likely originated in bats. Like all species, bats require specific environmental conditions in an area for it to be a suitable habitat. Climate change has altered these conditions, pushing species closer to human populations and increasing the likelihood of virus transmission. While researchers debate direct causal links between climate change and COVID-19, climate change undoubtedly heightens the risk of disease outbreaks.This outbreak then developed into a global pandemic, and its effects escalated into multiple crises. The epidemiological response to this emergency caused a global economic crisis. Some research suggests that in addition, it caused a global mental health crisis, with millions suffering from the stress of isolation, uncertainty and financial hardship. This pattern extends beyond the pandemic. Experts at the World Economic Forum have warned that natural resource shortages, climate change and geopolitical instability are converging into a polycrisis likely to worsen by 2030. These crises would be challenging on their own, but each one amplifies the others.Why is this happening now?One reason is the unprecedented level of global interconnectedness. In the 14th century, the Black Death devastated Europe, yet regions such as South America remained largely unaffected until colonizers brought the disease centuries later. Limited global trade and travel previously contained crises geographically. Today, however, events can spread rapidly around the world. For instance, the 2021 blockage of the Suez Canal disrupted global supply chains. In Berlin, I couldn’t buy bicycle parts due to a ship stranded on another continent. Similarly, a widespread outage affecting Windows devices resulted in at least $10 billion in financial damages. While globalization and standardization have brought undeniable benefits, they have also coupled global risks in unprecedented ways.A second factor is the scale of current human resource consumption and pollution. For example, since 1950, humanity has consumed more than half of all the energy ever produced in history. That means we've used more energy in the last 75 years than in the previous 200,000 years combined. This is a general pattern called “Great Acceleration.” Such rapid consumption is destabilizing Earth's critical systems, exacerbating climate change and biodiversity loss, and reducing Earth's resilience to crises.Solutions for a polycrisis worldDealing with a polycrisis requires more than acknowledging its existence; it requires a fundamental shift in how we think about and respond to crises. Some may dismiss the term as a mere buzzword, claiming that it's simply a new way of saying “a lot of bad things are happening at the same time.” But this perspective misses the point. Dismissing the polycrisis is like describing soccer as “just people kicking a ball into a white square.” You don't win a soccer game that way. In the same way, we need to understand how crises interact to develop strategies to address them.First, we must recognize that this is not going to go away. According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), if current trends continue, competition for essential resources such as water and food will lead to declining living standards worldwide, even in developed countries. Accepting this reality can help us build the resilience we need for the decades ahead. Duke has a responsibility as an educational institution to help students meet these challenges. Its goal for every student to become climate literate is a good start.Secondly, we need a clearer understanding of what is happening. Researchers often study isolated aspects of crises without fully grasping their broader interconnections. Economists might recognize that climate change exacerbates inequality but overlook how it fuels political extremism. Climate scientists understand ecological impacts but less so their socioeconomic consequences. Organizations like the Cascade Institute advocate for systematic global research on these interconnections, akin to IPCC efforts on climate change. Especially in times when some political groups deny scientific evidence, universities like Duke should leverage resources to foster interdisciplinary research.Finally, addressing the polycrisis requires substantial human and financial investment in systemic solutions. It's much “cheaper” psychologically and financially for governments to write checks to address immediate symptoms, such as cost-of-living crises than to invest in systemic infrastructure improvements. While immediate aid is often critical, it doesn't address the underlying problems. Long-term solutions require investment in science, infrastructure, renewable energy, education and social reform. Although expensive up front, the cost of a crisis — both socially and financially — is far greater.Duke is home to some of the brightest minds in policy, environmental science, public health and STEM. We have the resources and platforms to be part of the solution, but it requires moving beyond passive awareness to active engagement.The question isn’t whether these crises will shape our future — it’s whether we’ll step up to shape our response.Jakob Hagedorn is a visiting international student from Berlin, Germany.

Look around,Aaron Siegle,2025-03-24T10:00:00Z,Mar,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/look-around-20250324.html,"We are all familiar with the distinctive buzzing noise of a Duke Card when it unlocks a door. The gratifying “beep beep” sound signifies to us that we’ve been granted access to wherever we need to go to — whether it’s our dorm, classroom or the gym. We treat this admission as automatic, after all, why would Duke suddenly deny us access to the places we need to be?Yet, this is what happened to me while working in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Lab at Grainger Hall. As my model was running on one of the desktops, I took a quick break to stretch my legs. However, when I tried to scan back into the room, my card set off the door alarm, meaning that I was denied access. This baffled me, as I use the GIS Lab frequently and successfully scanned into the room a few minutes earlier. What changed?This silly mishap revealed to me a broader reality that I had taken for granted. As a student here, I felt a sense of ownership over the physical spaces I traverse, even if this notion is untrue from a strict legal standpoint. This is why every alumni weekend, there’s always that alum who asks you why you are sitting in their seat at the library, even if they haven’t stepped foot inside the building for decades. Being on the inside of the Duke Card access only door gave me a sense of power and superiority that I never realized was there until it was taken away from me.In an increasingly digital world, our interactions with our physical surroundings still have a profound impact on who we are. Think about the last time when you randomly ran into one of your friends. Where were you? What time of day was it? Wherever it occurred, this interaction couldn’t have been possible without Duke. Duke had to decide to admit you both in the first place. Duke built and maintained the sidewalk you are standing on. Duke designed the class schedule in such a way that you both happened to be out and about at the same time. And this isn’t a bad thing — nice job Duke! But in a society where we pride ourselves in our individualism and free will, it’s important to acknowledge that most of our encounters are socially engineered.Asserting that our existence is socially engineered is a bit bold, I’ll concede. Even if Duke controls the options, I decide how I want to play the game — that’s the beauty of college. For example, I can think of four different ways to walk between Gross Hall and Bostock Library. On each one of these routes, I’ll have a discrete probability of seeing certain people, based on the time of day and weather. Of course there’s some stochasticity involved, but by on large, we’re creatures of habit.Why, then, do we choose to engage with the people we are close to? Surely it is not the result of a simple distribution of those we pass by the most on the quad. I believe that our social structures can be explained by the economic model of Tiebout sorting. In this analysis of suburban municipalities across America, economist Charles Tiebout posited that families chose which suburb to live based on their personal valuation of the goods and services that particular location provided. This results in the aggregation of like-minded residents in certain towns, even if on the surface two communities may appear quite similar.At Duke, and in really any community, we engage in Tiebout sorting. We gravitate to people who share values with us, those whose “personal valuations” of the world align with ours. We are willing to defy spatial trends to be with these people, even if it means taking the bus all the way to Blue Light.This ability to vote with our feet is a defining factor of the 21st century, where space-time compression has given us unprecedented mobility. 15% of Duke undergraduates are from North Carolina and 14% are international students. This wasn’t always the case, as the percentage of international students increased by 42% between 2012 and 2017.Despite the geographic diversity of Duke students, why do I still feel at home here? The answer lies in the universal diffusion of shared values and interests. Our widespread access to information has allowed us to develop niche interests — passions that our friends back home may not relate to. But since Duke aggregates such a wide variety of people, we are bound to meet a few friends who are similar to us, even if we may seem quite dissimilar on the surface level.While this spatial clustering of like-minded people may be great for us socially, it has a deleterious impact on our society. In his book “The Big Sort,” author Bill Bishop demonstrates how America has become more stratified in homogenous communities since the end of the 20th century. As a result, Americans spatially realigned themselves along social, economic and racial lines.So, in an era where most of the world is just a few hours’ flight away, does location really matter? Apparently, yes, it still does matter. Just listen to the gripes of Duke students (who often hail from the world’s premier cities) about how dull and insufficient Durham is. When I told another attendee at an event in Washington D.C. that I was a Duke student, he replied, “Duke is a great school, it looks like a castle but it’s in the middle of nowhere.” Even though Duke is located in a vibrant metropolis of 2.1 million people, it is still imagined as a medieval castle perched on vast swaths of wilderness.Even if it deviates from the norm, we can choose how we engage with our surroundings. However, most of us are too glued to our screens to fully comprehend this choice. We are shaped by our physical environment, but, as seen with Tiebout sorting, we can alter it too. This can be as simple as trying a new route to walk between your dorm and your classes. Or exploring a part of Durham you’ve never been to. These simple actions will expose us to new people and experiences that we may have never known existed before. Reclaiming authority over our spatial autonomy is the first step to seeing the world in a new light.Aaron Seigle is a Trinity junior. His pieces typically run on alternate Fridays."

Diversity isn't just for STEM,Sonia Green,2025-03-21T10:00:00Z,Mar,21,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/diversity-isnt-just-for-stem-20250321.html,"Ever since I was a young girl, I knew I did not like science, technology, engineering or math (STEM). I preferred reading and writing to math and science. I loved the library, not the lab. I was captivated by stories. I never found math or science particularly fun. When I would complain to my mom about going to these STEM activities, she reminded me that it’s important to try new things before deciding if you like them. Even when I participated in STEM enrichment programs, like Science in the Summer at my local library or Girls Who Code, I was more excited to see the finished product than I was about learning how we got there. As I grew older, I noticed that most diversity programs for underrepresented fields seemed to focus solely on STEM. Now that I am at Duke, I feel the trend continues. There’s always a push for Black students to explore STEM. And there is a need for it: only 5% of physicians and 4.2% of computer scientists are Black. In fact, only 7% of the STEM workforce is Black. I do believe there is a diversity issue within STEM fields and there are systemic barriers in place that make it harder for Black youth to pursue STEM, like how Black students lack exposure to STEM. It is much more difficult for a student to pursue a career path if they don’t know it exists. Moreover, some Black students may lack mentors and educational support to guide them in pursuing these careers. However, this can be said about all fields and raises the question: Why are we so focused on STEM? One theory I have is that we may perceive STEM as harder and therefore Black people in STEM are seen as exceptional in some way. Maybe our culture just prioritizes STEM and that’s where our focus lies. But regardless, before pushing Black students towards STEM, we should first ask ourselves — is this even something they are interested in? Why does it seem like we have normalized pushing Black youth en masse toward STEM? Everywhere I turn at Duke, I see programs, classes and organizations — sometimes even individual students — fighting to diversify specific fields in engineering and the natural sciences. But what about Black students who just don’t enjoy STEM? Only 5% of lawyers are Black. Black people make up a mere 6% of public school teachers, college professors and reporting journalists. In a nation that is only about 13% Black, it is necessary to remember that diversity has a place in every field. STEM is not the only way to benefit society. Every field has its place and every discipline has the potential to produce something valuable.We should begin by working with students to identify their strengths and find where they can be most successful. If a young girl loves art, she should be allowed to pursue art, not pushed towards science. If a boy loves to read, he is more suited for the social sciences, not engineering, and that’s okay. When students are gifted in many areas, it’s important to let them choose and emphasize that they don’t have to choose STEM. Almost every industry — from law to education to politics — lacks racial diversity in some way, shape or form. There is room outside of STEM to make a difference.And that’s what I realized: I was able to discover my passion for writing, history, film and many other non-STEM disciplines, once I finally told my mom I no longer wanted to explore STEM. She listened and let me pursue other interests because to her, STEM wasn’t the only option. But what happens when Black youth are not given the opportunity to explore anything else? With Donald Trump’s current attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs that have fought to create opportunities for underrepresented populations, diversity is more important than ever. We are at risk of losing these programs altogether. Our generation has the potential to produce great writers, teachers, educators and academics only if the push for diversity extends beyond science, technology, engineering and math.Diversity is extremely important, but I hope that we as a society realize that it belongs outside the scope of just STEM. When I decided to major in African and African American Studies at Duke, many people did not see the vision I had for myself outside of more traditional pathways. When I declared myself “Anti-STEM”, I’m sure many were even more confused. It took me a lot of exploration and personal reflection to finally figure out what I want to do. It wasn’t engineering or computer science or medicine — it was storytelling through the arts. I hope that the Black youth who come after me have the same space to explore and reflect and make the same uninhibited choice for themselves, irrespective of their field. It’s time that we show younger generations that wherever their interests lie, they are valid. As Duke students, we need to remember that readers and writers are just as important as engineers, computer scientists and aspiring doctors. All fields need diversity, not just STEM.Sonia Green is a Trinity senior. Her pieces typically run on alternate Thursdays."
Sustainability without sacrifice: Rethinking the path to a greener future,Aaron Siegle,2025-03-20T10:00:00Z,Mar,20,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/sustainability-without-sacrifice-20250320.html,"I am not fond of cold showers, especially when it is cold outside. But I’ve become familiar with the art of taking a cold shower as a resident of the Duke Smart Home, an energy-efficient residence on Central Campus designed to be a living laboratory for sustainable technologies.Hot water at the Smart Home is made by a heat pump that is powered by solar panels perched atop the home’s roof. This system is augmented by a gas water heater. Unfortunately, during cloudy stretches of the winter, the solar panels don’t provide enough electricity to power the system and the gas heater can’t keep up with demand by itself. You get the picture — no sun equals cold shower.Does sustainability require sacrifice? This is the central question of my showering conundrum. I came to the realization that while sustainability may entail the responsible stewardship of resources, it cannot result in a lower quality of life. A fundamental part of the human psyche is to improve one’s lot in life, regardless of the consequences to the environment. Convincing people to abandon their modern lives and amenities in the name of sustainability is a losing strategy. Fortunately, choosing between sustainability and modernity is a false dichotomy.Humans struggle to give up things that they enjoy. Think about how hard dieting is. 95% of people who go on diets fail. Why? Research points to evolution. As a species that has been deprived of calories for most of its existence, our instinct is to eat as much as we possibly can, as we may not know when our next meal will be. The same logic applies to pretty much everything else. Now that man has reached the zenith of his technological prowess, he does not simply have the willpower to put his new gadgets away and go back to a life of uncertainty.Asking people to give up amenities and pay more for inferior products because they are sustainable will fail. In my showering example, I stopped taking cold showers. Instead, I went to Wilson Gym, where the showers are nice and hot. In less trivial terms, most people won’t stop flying out of sustainability concerns. Even though flying contributes to climate change, air travel massively benefits our society by providing unparalleled connectivity and mobility between distant places. Without the invention of the airplane, many Duke students would not have even considered attending this university. In this way, environmental degradation isn’t driven by corporate greed alone but also by millions of ordinary people going about their lives.If building a sustainable future required substantial personal sacrifices, then we would be in trouble. But the energy transition does not require suffering. In his book“Cheaper, Faster, Better,” businessman and politician Tom Steyer argues that eliminating fossil fuels will propel, not hold back, our economy. Renewable technologies are well on their way to becoming cheaper, faster and better than their fossil fuel-based counterparts. Solar is now the “cheapest electricity in history,” according to the International Energy Agency. Batteries that can store energy for up to 100 hours are increasing the reliability of renewable energy, avoiding the cold shower problem. And this is only one out of many examples where sustainable alternatives are beating fossil fuels on price, speed and quality.Decarbonization is not only about averting a climate crisis. Sustainability tracks with efficiency, allowing companies to lower their carbon footprint and save money at the same time. For electricity, grid enhancing technologies (GETs) can reduce electricity losses by up to 20%, resulting in the same proportion of emissions reductions. For buildings, energy-efficient aerogels that enhance window insulation improve home energy performance by 65%, reducing emissions and utility bills. Companies such as Kubik and Charah Solutions take trash and turn them into commodities, reducing waste and making a profit at the same time.We must reframe the narrative surrounding sustainability and sacrifice. For too long, environmentalists have framed combatting climate change as a personal struggle, a victory that can be won through suffering and discipline alone. Though our individual actions do make a difference, we have limited pathways to live a low carbon lifestyle while also being a part of modern society. Instead, we must focus on creating systems that allow people to live a low carbon lifestyle without even noticing a change in their daily lives. This can range from building more walkable cities to developing sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). We can further this movement to a sustainable economy by purchasing lower carbon alternatives and investing in climate tech companies that are pioneering new breakthroughs.“Many people will deny doing anything wrong because distractions constantly dull our consciousness of just “Laudato Si.” This article isn’t meant to give a false sense of security about the state of our planet. Rather, it is an attempt to move beyond blaming and shaming others towards the advancement of enduring solutions. We must walk a fine line between complacency and fearmongering to achieve climate goals that need broad based support to succeed.

Research should not be understood as a financial loss,Francesco Ria,2025-03-19T10:00:00Z,Mar,19,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/research-not-financial-loss-20250319.html,"Recently, I attended a Duke internal training seminar where some disturbing information was shared. One of the arguments from the presentation was that research is, supposedly, a financial loss for the University. According to Duke’s Office for Research and Innovation 2023-2024 annual report, total research expenditures was $1.5 billion (up from $1.39 billion in 2022-2023) . For the same period, Duke researchers could count on the support of $863 million coming from federal grants ($901 million in the previous fiscal year). The resulting negative difference would come out to around $640 million. Though research income from non-federal support is unknown, these sources of income are likely minimal compared to federal support. To partially support research activities, the Duke University Health System transferred to the University $133 million in fiscal year 2023, and $235 million in fiscal year 2024. Such transfer is possible because in 2024 the Health System generated a positive operating income of almost $203 million, and a positive nonoperating income of $453 million circa. It appears that these numbers confirm the claim about research being a burden for Duke finance.The seminar audience was entirely composed of Duke clinical and research faculty. Part of the discussion focused on understanding the reasons why we perform research if it results in what is on paper a financial loss. One of the conclusions from the discussion was that we do research because it brings reputation to the institution. To this end, a study published in 2020, involving 4,627 patients nationwide, evaluated which factors mainly drive individuals in making decisions about where to receive care. The study highlighted that over 60% of respondents did some kind of research on available healthcare institutions before picking a hospital, and over 90% of those said the information they gathered helped their decision about which hospital to pick. According to patients, the most important factor impacting their decision is hospital reputation — this was considered important by almost 62% of respondents. followed by physician experience (52%) and primary care recommendations (43%). Thus, research brings an indirect form of income by boosting reputation, which boosts patient service and other income revenue streams —. It is worth noting that, for fiscal year 2024 90% of the Health System’s total revenues ($6.6 billion) come from patient service revenue.In light of these findings, framing research as a financial loss for Duke University is not just misleading, but in my opinion also dangerous. This is especially in the current political, historical and social context where academic institutions are already under attack, and are also facing political decisions that are aiming to reduce funding and support to research and education, like recent White House Executive Orders.To avoid becoming accomplices in the attacks on university and research institutions, it would be desirable to carefully choose the tone to use in describing the current scenario. Many university functions represent a financial loss: accounting, maintenance, management, marketing, communication and so on. Like many of those functions, research is a financial loss from a mere accounting point of view. A more intellectually honest approach would be to also consider the overall indirect value and income generated by a specific function before labelling it simply as a loss. If, as researchers, we believe that what we are doing is beneficial for the institution — and, ultimately, for our patients — we need to strongly deliver this message both within and outside the organization. Public and within-university communications of any sort should try to resist the urge to undermine the importance of any components of our institutions. It is important to distance ourselves from the mainstream stereotypes associated with universities, often described as a den of idlers. Instead, researchers should emphasize our archetypes — namely our original education and research values, essential in providing high quality patient care — as a mature way to ask society writ large for support in our imperfect, yet noble academic mission.Francesco Ria is a medical physicist and serves as an assistant professor of radiology."
Community members share remembrances for John Feinstein,Remembrances,2025-03-18T12:00:00Z,Mar,18,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/remembrances-john-feinstein-67d8fdb6e2e2f-20250318.html,"While John was known as a chronicler of the success of Duke basketball and its coach Mike Krzyzewski, John did not launch his writing career in the reflected glory of day-to-day coverage of Duke sports teams in the national spotlight. He started at The Chronicle in 1973 on the news side. But by the end of the fall of his freshman year he was dabbling in sports. In an era when college football teams like Alabama, Texas and Notre Dame, stockpiled unlimited talent, Duke football competed for the opening weeks but faltered as injuries took a toll. In basketball Duke was transitioning from the Vic Bubas era to a new Bill Foster resurgence that reached its height only after John graduated. The basketball record during his 4 years was 50-56, and it was 2-10 in the ACC for his senior year.As his first sports editor I’d like to say that I set John on the path to his phenomenal success, but that’s not the case. From the beginning, John had the drive to report an event, but the creativity to shape a story. One of his early basketball articles was an account of a Duke-Maryland clash, and John sets the stage by describing the Cole Fieldhouse madhouse of its time. John even had the tools of the trade, a compact typewriter he could easily tote to assignments and from which he turned out clean copy on deadline with the flair of the writers he grew up reading in New York City. John was covering basketball by his sophomore year and was sports editor for his junior and senior years. My job was to recognize his talent and then get out of his way.I have read that John may have had problems with editors, but I did not find that to be the case. The only challenge I recall was when he had been in our Flowers office and had overheard me praising a colleague for his coverage of an intramural championship game. John confronted me asking why I never seemed as effusive in my praise for his articles. I told him I needed folks to cover Intramural championships, and his colleague was doing the best he could do; while John was covering ACC basketball, a recognition of his talent, and, though his colleague was not going to get much better, John could and the criticism might help. John said okay; he was fine with that.Steve GarlandA photo of The Chronicle's staff in 1975. Steve Garland, Trinity '75 and former sports editor at The Chronicle from 1973 -75.~~~~~Like John, I worked at the Chronicle from 1973 to 1977, so I had the pleasure of knowing and working with John when he was there. I was a mediocre journalist at best, but I enjoyed my time there and the comradery of working there. It was obvious to all of us even then that John was an enormous talent, a true sports fan and was destined to make a name for himself. It came as no surprise to me or anyone else at Duke when he became one of the most prolific sports writers of all time. I loved reading his books about those who struggled to make it in sports – battling through Q-school in the hope of getting a PGA card, fighting in the minor leagues in the hope of getting one more shot at playing in MLB and the challenges of competing on the PGA tour. Though I think John was a college basketball fan first and foremost — how can anyone go to Duke and not be a college basketball fan — it is his books about golf and baseball that are my favorites. The Duke basketball teams that John covered were good teams, but not good enough to compete for an ACC title. Those were the days of the great Maryland, Carolina, and NC State teams. This was the pre-Coach K era. I have many of John’s books in my library. John and I were not close friends, and I don’t think I ever saw him after we graduated, but we were colleagues, and I followed his career from afar for the past 48 years. I was shocked and saddened to hear of his sudden passing. After all, we are both the same age, and 69 is way too young for him to be gone. It also reminds those of us who graduated with him just how quickly and unexpectedly life can end, leaving loved ones behind and in shock. John was a legend at The Chronicle, and I hope he will always be remembered and honored there and by the entire Duke community. Thank you, John for all your brilliant insights into the world of college and professional athletics. Rest in peace.Mitch Wiener, Trinity '77. ~~~~~ Chasing the gameIt’s Sunday morning and I wish I could text John Feinstein right now and ask him what he thought of the game last night. Duke won its 23rd ACC Tournament defeating Louisville without its superstar Cooper Flagg. I want to ask him about the excellent and unselfish guard play of Knueppel, Proctor and James. I have this team making the Final Four and wanted to know what he thought about their chances to go further after watching the talented supporting cast dominate the field. John and I called this subject “the unspeakable” topic because we didn’t want to jinx the future. I’ve known John for the past two years while working as his editor on “Five Banners: Inside the Duke Basketball Dynasty.” He was ready to write a new chapter for this team if “the unspeakable” came to pass. On Thursday afternoon, he passed away suddenly. I’m still in shock.Since arriving at Duke Press in 2019, I’ve always wanted to publish a book about Duke basketball. John found his way to me in the spring of 2023 through his agent Andrew Blauner who represents our author, Alex Wolff. I’d read Feinstein’s “Season on the Brink” when it was first published in 1986 and realized our book could take the reader into the locker room and onto the court in similar ways. Those five championships were about sacrifices, hardships, personalities, conversations and the bonds between coaches and players, something that is fading from the college game. Basketball also played a big role in the first 100 years of the University and I wanted a book for the Centennial. John had a vision for the project. It was as though he’d been thinking about it for decades.“I’ve covered every national championship and have a title: Five Banners.”On that first call, he told me he had texted Coach K about it. I had no idea how close they were. “Mike has agreed to help out.”He proceeded to give me a sense of their relationship. John had been at the much talked about Denny’s conversation in Atlanta in the wee hours of the morning after a tough ACC tournament loss to Virginia in 1983. They had remained close. It was Coach K who advised him on the prospect of being embedded with Coach Knight for the season.“Are you out of your [expletive deleted] mind?”Feinstein wrote the Indiana book as if his life depended on it and it sold millions.“My biggest fear was getting thrown out of the locker room,” John said. “It almost happened.” The phone call could have lasted hours. John was a gifted storyteller with an encyclopedic memory. He was also a gym rat, a sports junkie with a tenacity when it came to his work. He never stopped publishing even up to the day he died. His most interesting stories were the things we couldn’t print. As an aspiring collegiate swimmer, he was supposed to go to Yale but “the gym smelled like chlorine.” He visited Duke and the sun was out, frisbees were flying and he watched the Blue Devils upset Maryland behind Gary Melchionni’s thirty-nine points. He ran into Gary years later in a steakhouse in Manhattan on the night he proposed to his first wife.“You’re the reason I went to Duke,” he said to him. Then proceeded to talk for another twenty minutes with Melchionni while his fiancé wondered where he was. We talked about everything, and he had an opinion on it all. My dad had been a college basketball coach. We knew the same people. I’m also a gym rat and like John, published a book on the Ravens. I also learned we had similar health issues.“You can still eat that steak. Just don’t eat all of it,” he told me. I sent back notes on the first draft of the manuscript. There was a brief mention of Jerry Tarkanian the legendary UNLV coach and we needed more about “Tark the Shark’s” impact on the game in the Pre-NIL era. UNLV played up-tempo basketball in an NBA style before it became the norm. They were loaded with NBA-level talent and Duke lost to them in the 1990 NCAA final. “I liked Tark very much,” John said. “I came to see Mike about helping Lefty Driesell [legendary Maryland coach] get into the Hall of Fame. He told me it was very difficult to get Guy Lewis and Jerry Tarkanian in. I told Mike that Tark was his fault.” Coach K was not pleased. Throughout it all, they sparred, they laughed, and they stuck together. He loved referring to Coach K as Adam Silver’s “consigliere.” That was vintage John: the perfect word and characterization. After publishing “The Legends Club” about Dean Smith, Jim Valvano and Mike Krzyzewski, Feinstein thanked his friend for his time.“John, I should be thanking you … I’m Catholic. When I die, I can tell God I’ve already been through purgatory,” said Coach K. John and I had bigger plans in the hopper. For instance, he’s always wanted to write the definitive biography of Coach K. We discussed strategies for making that happen. John Feinstein was my friend too.Dean Smith, director of Duke University Press.~~~~~ I met John as a January '77 transfer while writing features for The Chronicle. I hardly ever saw him, because he was out on his beat, reporting. But I did sit around and have a beer with him and other staffers after we put the paper to bed a couple of times. I read his work with great admiration because he could capture action and emotion unlike any other writer, and he was always accurate. I felt like I knew him, because he inspired me to be a better writer, whether it was with his books or his stories. I wish I had known him better. But he was busy doing what he did best. I am sorry for his loss.Ann Bierbower Lally, Trinity '78.~~~~~ John was Mr. Duke Sports. He will be greatly missed.

His wit and interesting insights will be missed!Parham R Fox, former resident in diagnostic radiology at the Duke University Medical Center.~~~~~ John served as a speaker for an alumni event at the Duke in D.C. office on Feb. 18, just 23 days before he passed away. The event showcased his book “5 Banners: Inside the Duke Basketball Dynasty,” and was co-sponsored by the book’s publisher Duke University Press, Duke University Libraries, The Chronicle and the Duke Entertainment, Media and Arts Network (DEMAN). John drove himself to the Duke in D.C. office from his home in rural Virginia, 3 hours away. He arrived early to make sure that he had ample time to sign books and speak with each alumni guest prior to the moderated interview. John was extremely gracious during the book signing, patiently taking time to discuss and share each person’s favorite Duke basketball memory. Following the book signing, we moved into the conference room for the interview moderated by Wall Street Journal reporter Amrith Ramkumar, Trinity ’17, who was the former editor-in-chief and sports editor of The Chronicle. Amrith served as an excellent interviewer — demonstrating his own deep knowledge of college basketball, while also pointing out how John’s access to Coach K differed immensely from the more limited access that challenged student reporters during his time on the Chronicle staff. During the interview, attended by nearly 100 alumni and guests, John enjoyed fielding many questions and comments from the audience. The event evolved into a fascinating conversation with John, where he shared many funny stories and unique insights that delighted his audience. The origin of this event is another fun story illuminating John’s enthusiasm to connect with alumni. John was on campus during Parents Weekend back in October for a book event with Coach K. Duke alumnus and parent Larry Smith, Pratt ’27 and Law ’94, was also on campus and bumped into John, Coach K and John’s publisher, Dean Smith, of Duke University Press. This encounter occurred under the Bryan Center Walkway where the three were surreptitiously waiting to enter the book event. Larry is a huge basketball fan and leveraged this surprise encounter to invite John to D.C. where Larry serves as a Board Member on the Duke D.C. Regional Board. John accepted on the spot, and Dean Smith provided his business card, eager for Duke University Press to be included. The event date of Feb. 18 was confirmed shortly after, and Chronicle CEO Chrissy Murray lined up Amrith Ramkumar to serve as the moderator. The event invitation launched in mid-January and immediately sold out with 100 registrants — a testament to the respect that John amassed during his extraordinary journalism career.

My then-12-year-old was a huge fan, having read every single one of his young adult books and starting on the adult ones. We saw John in the parking lot struggling with the meter. I introduced myself as a fellow Chronicle alum and offered him quarters.Inside, John read from his latest book and graciously answered every question the audience had. My son took notes on John’s thoughts about sports and student athletes and used those notes, appropriately cited, in several class papers — from elementary school through high school.All these years later my son credits four great men with his love of sports: his dad who loves everything sports (including driving to early morning hockey practices), his grandfather who loves to play tennis and racquet ball with him, his great uncle who loved to talk baseball and John Feinstein.

"Seriously, block my shot: March Madness, gender inequity and playing pickup in Wilson",Samantha George,2025-03-17T10:00:00Z,Mar,17,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/block-my-shot-march-madness-gender-inequity-pickup-20250317.html,"“That’s what I always talk about ... women’s basketball isn’t just suddenly good. It’s been good.” - Caitlin ClarkAt a school like Duke, March can only be associated with one thing: the iconic sixty-four team tournament, full of Cinderella stories, crazy upsets and unprecedented matchups, aptly dubbed March Madness. Its campus acclaim is well founded, as the Duke men’s basketball team has made 46 appearances in the tournament since 1955, which includes 17 Final Four appearances, 11 National Championship appearances and 5 National Championship wins. This season, the men’s team has attracted a lot of attention in particular, with freshman standout Cooper Flagg leading the team to a No. 1 spot in a recent AP Poll. While the men’s team, and men’s college basketball in general, has always garnered national attention, women’s basketball has recently reached a new stage, thanks to players like Candace Parker, Paige Bueckers and, of course, Caitlin Clark. A noticeable culture shift has occurred in recent years, boosted by structural changes like the NCAA allowing the women’s tournament to also use the branding “March Madness” in 2022, after approximately 40 years of the name being exclusively used for the men — a clear symbol of gender inequity within the sport. Certain benchmarks too, like the 2024 women’s championship (South Carolina vs. Iowa) receiving over 18.7 million viewers — 4 million more viewers than the men's championship — seem to indicate a new wave of women’s sports. Although we finally seem to be getting over the hump of thinking that watching a women’s basketball game or being able to name more than one WNBA team buys you feminist brownie points — we seem to be moving towards a culture that normalizes women’s sports as just sports, plain and simple — there is still work to be done. The issue of unequal pay in sports is not a new one, but it remains relevant as ever. While the WNBA is a younger, smaller league and generates a lower revenue than the NBA, inequitable revenue-sharing agreements remain an issue. The NBA paying its players an average of 49-51% of the league’s revenue, while WNBA players take home a maximum of 22.8%. Even on our own campus, the gender divide between the sports is palpable. Just this year, 2,652 students, approximately 41% of the undergraduate population, took the tenting test, fighting for the opportunity to camp for weeks to see Duke take on UNC. This game filled Cameron Indoor to its capacity of 9,314 occupants, packing in more than 1,600 undergraduates into the student section. Comparatively, the women’s rivalry game versus UNC, both AP top 20 teams at the time, attracted only 7,010 attendees and boasted a fairly disappointing showing from the Cameron Crazies in the student section. But what does this have to do with Wilson gym? For me, this is where these issues where it all begins: on the pickup court. At a humble 5’5”, coupled with a fairly quiet, unassuming demeanor, I may not strike you as a person familiar with draining threes and wiping shoes at the free throw line. But I’ve spent my fair share of time hooping and have grown all too familiar with the feeling of stepping into a gym as the only girl. There’s nothing quite like standing on the line — knowing you’ve played varsity for four years in high school, knowing you’ve got a mean stepback, knowing you know the rules — as people pick teams and inevitably leave you for last, until one of the guys sighs and goes, “I’ll take the girl.” My experiences playing pickup in Wilson haven’t been overtly negative, but if we believe in encouraging women’s participation in basketball, we need to address these small, sometimes even silent, barriers within our own community here on campus. In the often male-dominated games, I often have to overperform — scoring more points and making fewer mistakes — in order to receive the same recognition as my male counterparts. If I miss a shot, it’s often the last time I’ll touch the ball for the rest of the game, while the guys can typically brick a few layups or airball threes and still be passed the ball over me.There are overcorrections, too, where girls are treated overly gently or even slightly patronized. I’ve been passed the ball out of pity, as an almost last resort, only to surprise my team of guys when I make the basket. I’ve had guys not play real defense while guarding me out of fear of offending me with a bump or push. I’ve had people complain about girls wanting to play on the claim that it compromises the competitiveness of the game.From conversations with friends, I’ve found this isn’t a unique issue, either — many women interested in rekindling their love for the game, or wanting to get a few runs in for exercise, or wanting to learn the game, have expressed to me their reluctance to hoop in Wilson because of the intimidation of entering a scene dominated by men.So with all this in mind, as we begin the weeks of flicking our TVs from basketball game to basketball game, if you want to do your part for women’s sports, help remove the barriers within your reach. If you’re a guy who frequents the pickup scene — treat the lone girl in Wilson as an equal, take their efforts seriously and offer pointers or advice as you would with any of your buddies. And if you’re a girl hesitating to dust off your shoes, I urge you to take the leap and take up your proper space on the court. Women’s sports are just sports, and normalizing girls hooping in Wilson gym is as good of a place to start as any. So, please, block my shot. Samantha George is a Trinity junior.

Getting close enough to care,Luke A. Powery,2025-03-17T10:00:00Z,Mar,17,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/getting-close-enough-to-care-20250317.html,"Last week, I spent a brief time on spring break with a small group of Duke students, Duke religious leaders and community members, who were helping with ongoing recovery efforts from Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina. We were serving with more than 100 other volunteers through the nonprofits Lutheran Disaster Resources Carolina and Community Organized Relief Effort. We were painting, removing trash and installing insulation and vapor barriers at a mobile home park that was severely damaged.Like many others, I knew of the devastation in that part of the state. But there is no substitute for getting close with one’s own eyes, ears, hands, nose and body. Some on our Duke team met people who lost the homes we were working on. While proximity doesn’t magically produce empathy, there’s nothing like getting close to a situation or people to better understand them and to begin to cultivate a deeper sense of caring for them.Seeing so many downed trees in western North Carolina reminded me of a tree described in the Bible. It is in a parable Jesus tells about a vineyard owner who wants to cut down a fig tree (Luke 13:6–9): “A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it and found none. So he said to the man working the vineyard, ‘See here! For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and still I find none. Cut it down! Why should it be wasting the soil?’ He replied, ‘Sir, let it alone for one more year, until I dig around it and put manure on it. If it bears fruit next year, well and good, but if not, you can cut it down.’”There are many lessons from this fig tree parable about caring, but I’ll highlight two. First, notice that it is the owner of the vineyard, not the gardener, who wants to cut down the fruitless fig tree. He’s no longer patient after three years. The owner is at a distance and when one is at a distance from a person, place or thing, it is too easy to demonize what you don’t know, judge it, and perhaps even desire to “cut it down.” The owner views the tree as disposable because he has no relationship with it.The gardener who has been the closest to the fig tree — caring for it, pruning it, watering it, talking to it (perhaps!) — is the one who asks the owner to give the tree another chance, “one more year.” The gardener asks for mercy for the fig tree and desires to keep working with it in an attempt to have it bear fruit. His proximity to the tree causes him to see its potential. He’s close enough to care. A second lesson from this fig tree parable is how the owner believes the tree has worth only if it produces the fruit, the figs, it’s supposed to yield. In contrast, the gardener can say “one more year” because he cares enough to commit to more time for and with the tree. He is willing to dig around it and put manure on it for the potential of fruit. But what drives him even more is that he sees the worth in the tree for just being a tree. Even without production, the tree is still alive and has worth — why cut down a living tree? My time in western North Carolina combined with the fig tree parable leaves me with questions to ponder: How much do we care for others when they don’t produce anything that can benefit us? Do we care for another just because they are worthy as a human being? Are we willing to get closer to others, not only to understand them but to truly care? What will motivate us to get close to others, especially those who are in need or are about to be “cut down”?Do we want to “close the gap” between us and others so that we can draw close enough to care? Or, will we “close the gate” between us and others so that we stay separated and indifferent?In this season, I’m left with such questions because when we are at a distance, we may not fully understand a situation or person or tree. We can easily say, “cut it down,” because we aren’t close enough to care. In your moment of need, wouldn’t you want someone to give you another chance, saying, “one more year”?The Rev. Dr. Luke A.

Favors for your future self,Anna Garziera,2025-03-16T10:00:00Z,Mar,16,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/favors-for-your-future-self-20250316.html,"Who is your future self? It’s easy to imagine them as a different person than you. You might have a clear picture of who you want to become. Or think you do.Either way, the classic interview question haunts you: Where do you see yourself in five years? Are you rich? Hardworking? Do you have your life together?Many of us would answer “yes.” Though our current lives as college students are a bit of a mess — awful sleep schedules, tall laundry piles and the occasional brutal hangover — our future lives are pristine. Neat. As precise as a Swiss clock.Some psychologists would beg to differ. As it turns out, we find it more difficult to change as we age. The habits we form in our 20s might just stay with us forever. Then, viewing our future selves as more disciplined than our current selves is not always productive — or realistic. Sorry to break it to you, but there’s a good chance you have an overly optimistic view of what your life will look like after college. You hold great expectations for the big stuff — your big-shot Wall Street job, your custom sports car, your huge open-concept home — but also the small stuff. Your neatly pressed suit. Your snazzy haircut. But what makes you think you’ll be more on top of your laundry in ten years?It’s important to realize that we are our past selves’ future selves. (Say that three times fast.) It seems obvious, silly to spell out, but you’ll grow up one day. You’ll fill the shoes of that “future self” you are now imagining. As simple as this sounds, it’s not always easy to grasp. Our future is ambiguous. We are illusioned to believe that everything will turn out okay. Everything has so far — why shouldn’t it? But think back to what you thought your college life would be like when you were in high school. Weren’t your classes easy? Your outfits fashionable? Didn’t you spend your days studying on the grass?Did I just burst your bubble? I apologize, but it’s important. And it’s relevant both in the short and long term. Spring break was just here. Leading up to this long-awaited rest, I heard so many students promise themselves that they would “lock in” during the break. Whether they were planning to tackle homework or study for an upcoming midterm, they sounded happy to loosen the pressure on the days leading up to the break. Play now, work later. I took the opposite approach. Knowing I wouldn’t want to do more than a couple hours’ worth of review every day while at Lake Lanier, Georgia with my rowing team, I buckled up and worked hard leading up to the break. I knocked out review problems, reworked problem sets and went through lecture slides for an upcoming midterm. It wasn’t easy. Seeing everyone enjoy the start of the break, I couldn’t help but feel left out. But it was worth it. The satisfaction was twofold. First, I was glad I could now ease the pressure and only do minimal work at the lake. I am already savoring the well-earned rest. Secondly, I felt fulfilled by what my prioritizing work while postponing play said about me. What I’ve found over the years is that this type of satisfaction never fails to deliver. Think of a time when you’ve started an assignment way earlier than you had to. The same day it was assigned, even. Think of how you felt the night it was due, when all you had to do was fish out the file, upload, submit and watch the Canvas confetti rain down. Wasn’t it nice? There are other things, too. I’ve always been a fan of keeping my inbox neat. I organize all my archived emails into folders and delete the rest. But only recently did I start to appreciate how powerful unsubscribing from email lists could be. I hadn’t realized how much mental space unwanted emails were taking. By unsubscribing, we can alleviate our future selves of the burden of having to deal with a full inbox.I’ve already shared some examples of how you can make life easier for “next-week you,” such as tackling assignments early or not leaving doing laundry until Sunday night. But you could also view this within a shorter time horizon. You could go to bed early tonight and remember to plug in your laptop so “tomorrow you” might have a better start to their day.Admittedly, it is easy to take front-loading too far. At the end of this, my sophomore year, I’ll be done with my Economics major but for one elective. I frontloaded the difficult core classes such that I might have a peaceful last couple of years at Duke. But maybe, I made my life more difficult than necessary the past two years. I could have left some for later. But the fact still stands. It takes grit to go against our evolutionary grain. Defying procrastination, doing favors for our future selves, can be one of the most fulfilling acts of self care. On a bad day, these small favors keep us going. Throughout the week, they keep showing up as little nuggets of surprise, and they’re always welcome. I hate doing laundry even on a good day. In fact, the best thing is to get into a routine of front-loading tasks we want to put off before we can even ponder putting them off. Do your laundry on a random Tuesday just because you woke up 40 minutes earlier than you had to. Your body won’t even register the effort.And after a while, this will start feeling like routine. Being on top of things will become second nature. This is important: life is harder if you don’t. It’s easier to get ahead than have to catch up after you’re behind. The biggest favor you can do for your future self is to stop thinking of them as a different person. They’re you, just a little older. They’ll have the same pressures and desires as you do right now, and it won’t get any easier.I am now the “future self” I was imagining four days ago when I decided to keep working through the weekend. In a couple of hours, we’ll leave for the lake. I can now reap the fruits of my labor.But I’m someone else at the same time. I’m my future self’s past self — and I’m still looking out for her. Future Anna will come back to her dorm room at the end of this week and find her room clean and her laundry done. She won’t have to deal with that on Sunday night.Anna Garziera is a Trinity sophomore. Her pieces typically run on alternate Sundays."
Full of hot air (or steam): A plan to replace natural gas at Duke,Aaron Siegle,2025-03-16T10:00:00Z,Mar,16,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/full-of-hot-air-replace-natural-gas-20250316.html,"One of my favorite campus traditions is the Race to the Secret Spots. For those who aren’t familiar, teams of twelve students run around campus in search of a specific location that they must decipher from a riddle. Teams that perform well receive a spot in K-Ville, and thus an entry in the Duke-UNC men’s basketball game. This year, students were stumped by esoteric places like the Sands Building, which I didn’t even know existed beforehand.However, one spot that is secret to most Duke students wasn’t featured in this year’s race — the West Campus Steam Plant. It’s an unassuming name for a facility that burns natural gas at over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The West Campus Steam Plant (and the smaller East Campus Steam Plant too) account for 80,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent (MTCO2e) out of the 198,000 MTCO2e of Duke’s on-campus emissions — roughly 40%. But unlike other aspects of campus operations, Duke doesn’t have a concrete plan on how it will replace natural gas with a more sustainable alternative. If the university wants to achieve zero on-campus emissions, this will have to change.“Natural gas” is really just a fancy term for a fuel that is up to 90% methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas that has a global warming potential (GWP) 28 times higher than CO2. However, burning methane has been encouraged as a sustainable solution, largely because of its clean burning properties, meaning that it releases fewer air pollutants at the point of combustion than other fossil fuels. Even environmental groups such as the Sierra Club once heralded natural gas a “bridge fuel” in their campaign to close coal-fired power plants.Other factors have contributed to the popularity of methane gas. Coal has been on the decline, falling from 52% to 16.2% of U.S. electricity production between 2000 and 2023. What happened?The short answer is fracking. Fracking, which is short for hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting large amounts of fluids into the ground to create pores in the rocks, allowing for previously inaccessible oil and gas to be extracted. The advent of new fracking made the U.S. the top oil and gas producing country in the world. This fracking boom, led by businessman such as Duke alum Aubrey McClendon, pushed natural gas prices down, thus making it cheaper than coal. Duke was part of this trend of transitioning from coal to natural gas. In 2011, the West Campus Steam Plant transitioned from burning coal to natural gas, which was seen as a significant sustainability breakthrough for the campus. But today, we know a lot more about the dangers of natural gas than we did then. Burning natural gas still emits criteria pollutants, including nitrous oxides (NOX) and particulate matter (PM). Natural gas pipelines can explode, leak or catch fire, as they do around 300 times a year in the U.S.The West Campus Steam Plant operates differently than a traditional natural gas power plant, which generates electricity for the grid. Instead, the facility is used to heat the buildings on West Campus and the hospital, as well as to sterilize medical equipment. The steam generated via methane gas combustion is piped through tubes that run across campus. Once inside a building, the steam is used for space and hot water heating, as well as for humidification and sterilization.Known as district heating, centralized heating systems like Duke’s can be more efficient than having individual heating systems in each building. But district heating comes with its own challenges. First, steam must be piped across campus at over 300 degrees Fahrenheit, which results in high energy losses and intensive maintenance. Second, if configured correctly, methane gas boilers have enough heat to provide both heating and electricity. Using the plant only for heat is declining akin to declining a buy-one-get-one-free deal at the supermarket.Duke’s current strategy to reduce its reliance on methane revolves around realizing other efficiencies to the steam distribution system. The utilities team is working to replace steam with hot water, which can be transported across campus at much lower temperatures, increasing efficiency by 30% and lowering the maintenance costs by 75%. The law school and the Fuqua School of Business switched from steam to hot water just last year. The university is also planning to install heat recovery chillers (HRCs), which will take warm water returning from the chilled water loop and boost the water’s temperature up to 150 degrees Celsius. This matches the temperature needed for the hot water system, lowering the energy needed to heat Duke’s campus. Though these changes will help, they don’t address the root of the problem — Duke still relies on natural gas for 49% of its energy needs. The university needs to find another way to heat the campus. Heat pumps, which use electricity to both heat and cool buildings, would eliminate the need for on-site fossil fuel combustion. But heat pumps have their own challenges, including the significant upfront costs associated with installation and difficulties adjusting to the extreme fluctuations in temperature (especially considering humidity) that Durham experiences. Additionally, heat pumps would require a shift away from district heating, which would force the university to abandon millions of dollars of infrastructure — an untenable proposition.Instead, Duke should keep district heating but replace its fuel source. Hydrogen contains many of the same properties as methane, except that it is not a greenhouse gas. Waste heat from the process of electrolysis, which transfers energy from electricity to hydrogen, can be piped through a district heating system like Duke’s — at Stanford, waste heat processed by HRCs covers 88% of the university’s heating needs. This could be combined with waste heat from other sources, such as data centers. If heat demand exceeds the supply of waste heat, then steam generated from hydrogen combustion could bolster heat supply. The continued addition of HRCs could achieve further efficiency gainsSustainability aligns with efficiency. Eliminating Duke’s reliance on natural gas can both save money and the environment. Though the West Campus Steam Plant is out of sight for most students, it should not be out of mind. Aaron Seigle is a Trinity junior. His pieces typically run on alternate Fridays."

"If academic freedom trumps the freedom to protest, democracy dies",Eli Meyerhoff,2025-03-07T23:00:00Z,Mar,7,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/academic-freedom-trumps-protest-democracy-dies-20250307.html,"Protest and repression are in the air. At a march last Wednesday, demonstrators demanded, “Duke don’t comply!” They aimed to show the Duke administration that “the Durham community will not stand by if they fold to [President Donald] Trump and dismantle DEI.” Beyond that, their march was also in defiance of the admin’s recent crackdown on protesters. Multiple students and faculty at Duke are threatened with disciplinary actionthat could lead to their suspension, expulsion or firing. For some of the protesters, they suspect their crime was disrupting the speech of a former Israeli attorney general to protest what they believe to be the University’s alleged “complicity” with Israel’s war on Gaza. Regardless of whether they are disciplined, the threat of punishment increases the chill effect on campus protest. The Duke administration’s rationale relies on a recently revised policy claiming that a “necessary condition” for “academic freedom” is “a determination to discourage conduct which is disruptive and disorderly.” By making this claim, Duke prioritizes some academics’ freedom of public speech over the freedom of students and other academics to protest.I’m a political scientist who has studied academic freedom for two decades, and I’m currently a fellow with the American Association of University Professors (AAUP)’s Center for the Defense of Academic Freedom. I see the Duke administration’s view of academic freedom as undermining a key way that higher education contributes to a thriving democracy.The freedom to protest is a key condition for democracy. Protest is inherently disruptive. As University of Chicago philosophy professor, Anton Ford, argues: “While not all protests are equally disruptive, all aim to disrupt normal life to at least some extent. … The Civil Rights Movement was not a classroom debate. It disrupted all institutions of society, including universities.” For a thriving democracy, protest is just as important as voting. Andre Perry and Carl Romer contend: “Public protests are manifestations of dissent and an expression of the urgent need to change policy. By driving media coverage, catalyzing congressional action and shifting public opinion, nonviolent protests have been a force behind positive social change.” From the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s to the Black Lives Matter and Palestinian liberation movements today, protests have been essential for disrupting powerful institution’s silencing of the voices of marginalized people and their allies. Thereby, disruptive protest enables the public to hear and learn from otherwise excluded people’s perspectives. In the pro-Palestinian solidarity protests, students and others have exercised their freedoms to learn, express dissent and inform others of the urgent need for policy change. As seen in study groups and “people’s universities” in the Gaza solidarity encampments, students have used their freedom to learn and their intellectual freedom to study how their universities are potentially implicated in the Israeli assault on Gaza. The disruptive protesters at Duke were also motivated by their studying of Duke’s connections to the conflict, such as through the endowments invested in defense industry corporations, like Raytheon, that produce the bombs that the Israeli military is using to destroy people’s homes and lives in Gaza and Lebanon. When they protest for their universities to divest from such corporations — and make demands like those of the Duke Divest Coalition — they are acting on their knowledge to engage in whatever disordering, disruptive conduct is necessary to bring about an end to that violence.Different political movements have seen protest and academic freedom as opposed or complementary. The 1960s student movements demanded and enacted a “wider type of freedom” through studying, deliberating and protesting that opened higher education to people of color, women and other marginalized people. The AAUP frames the freedoms of academics to teach, research and engage in public speech as interrelated with freedoms for students. In the classroom, a professor’s academic freedom is meant to secure their conditions for teaching in ways that facilitate students’ freedoms to learn, experiment and develop capacities for democratic participation, including protest.Contrary to this expansive view of academic freedom promoted by the AAUP, right-wing attacks on higher education have weaponized a limited version of academic freedom to push back against the gains of the 1960s student movements. For example, consider Rep. Elise Stefanik’s “Restoring Academic Freedom on Campus Act” that framed academic freedom as being mutually exclusive to implementing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) criteria in admissions, hiring and promotion. In Stefanik’s view, giving some people academic freedom requires increasing unfreedom for other people — that is, a clawback of the 60s movements’ gains in educational freedom such as greater inclusion in admissions and protections from discrimination. Rather than the wider view advocated by groups like the AAUP, this right-wing, limited version of academic freedom — emerging in reaction to the gains of student protest movements for greater equality and justice — seems to be echoed in the Duke administration’s view of academic freedom as antithetical to disruptive protest.Returning to the Duke event with the Israeli attorney general, which was framed as “a conversation,” one might ask why the protesters did not try to engage their opponent in civil dialogue. This has been the main approach of the Duke administration, such as through the speaker series in which this talk was presented, aiming “to make space in the Duke campus community for rigorous and respectful debate in which differing perspectives are welcome on current and past conflicts in the [Middle East] region.”Yet, the administration’s centering of “civil discourse” obfuscates inequalities of power. Who has the power to define what counts as “civil”? North Carolina State Professor of Sociology Michael Schwalbe notes, “Historically, it has been those in power who demand civility from those who seek redress of grievances.” For over a year, protesters at Duke have been trying to engage the Duke administration in dialogue about what they understand as the University’s relation with the Israeli state’s alleged apartheid and genocide of Palestinians. In many settings, such as the Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility (ACIR) meetings, the final outcomes of decision-making do not seem to reflect a process in which the protestors’ demands were genuinely considered. In response to the Duke Divest Coalition bringing their 56-page, thoroughly researched divestment proposal, the ACIR gave only a brief one-page response. If the administration selectively chooses to refuse civil dialogue with protesters about their demands while pushing civil dialogue on the administration’s terms — as in the Provost’s Initiative — this seems to be a cynical use of the idea of “civil dialogue” as a means for maintaining inequalities of power and justifying business as usual. The administration asks the pro-Palestinian protesters to come to the table for dialogue when the table is built on the demolished homes and mass graves of Palestinian people. Rather than go along with the administration’s charade, the protesters rationally chose to escalate their tactics toward more disruptive means. In privileging civil discourse over protest, the Duke administration undermines the aim of the protest this past November: to highlight how Israel’s assault on Gaza has destroyed the conditions for Palestinian people’s freedoms — of learning, housing, food, water and life. In that regard, the administration’s stance is similar to Trump’s criticisms of Black Lives Matter protesters — calling them “thugs” and “terrorists” for their disruptiveness in order to discredit them and distract from their demands for equality. Not surprisingly then, the Duke administration’s repression of protest in the guise of restoring “order” anticipates the kind of repression we will see intensified under the Trump regime. The repression is not only of pro-Palestinian solidarity activists (as we already see in Trump’s Executive Order to deport foreign students) but also of a much wider range of people in higher education and beyond, including immigrants, transgender people, people with disabilities, Pell Grant recipients, student debtors and many more. Most worrisome, the administration misses the opportunity to support and learn from the very people who, through their protests, have been demonstrating one of the most effective routes for resistance to Trump’s attacks on higher education and all other conditions for democracy.Eli Meyerhoff is a fellow at the American Association of University Professors’ Center for the Defense of Academic Freedom, a member of the Duke Jewish Solidarity Movement, and a visiting scholar and program coordinator at the John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute."
"On the recent anniversary of Paul Farmer’s death: Language, community engagement and global health",Mya Harris,2025-03-06T11:00:00Z,Mar,6,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/paul-farmer-anniversary-global-health-20250306.html,"Paul Farmer, Trinity ’82, was a global health scholar who worked to re-envision the way the world approached healthcare in low-resource settings. Farmer passed away on Feb. 21, 2022, at the age of 62. Farmer’s work, particularly in Haiti, set a precedent for capacity building and community-based healthcare models that held dignity, human rights and sustainability at the forefront. As an anthropologist and clinician, Farmer devoted his life to addressing grave disparities in health. As a Duke alumnus, Farmer’s enduring legacy remains deeply relevant to students today, especially those working at the intersection of global health and social justice. One of Farmer’s distinguishing traits was his commitment to embedding himself within the social fabric of the communities that he served. Unlike many foreign aid efforts that approach their work from an arms length, Farmer took residence among the people of Cange, Haiti — listening, learning and responding to their needs in real time. Additionally, his work was not one broad stroke; he saw his patients as individual people and felt a great sense of responsibility towards them. He was known for hiking into the high points of the mountains to do welfare checks on patients when they missed a dose of their antiretroviral medication. The essentiality of Farmer’s work is evident in its global reach. Farmer began treating drug-resistant tuberculosis in Carabayllo, Peru, and his efforts to thwart multidrug resistant tuberculosis would continue on to Cuba and Russia. With additional support, Farmer was able to lower the prevalence of tuberculosis in his target countries so much so that they became comparable to their high-resourced counterparts. He leveraged these accomplishments to endorse the idea that “some lives matter less is the root of all that is wrong with the world,” emphasizing that improving healthcare in resource-constrained settings was both critical and achievable.Farmers worked from the understanding that one is ill-equipped to address health disparities when they work within a vacuum. In order to enact meaningful change, you must develop a profound understanding of the economic, political, historical and cultural forces shaping a community's lived experience. As he noted in Tracy Kidder’s “Mountains Beyond Mountains,” “In mastering a language, one had to learn not just the literal meanings of words but also their connotations, and to grasp those one had to know the politics and economic systems and histories of a place.” For Farmer, learning Haitian Creole entailed more than improved communication; it was about respect, deep cross-cultural engagement and the dismantling of power imbalances between doctors and patients. His work to understand the language was emblematic of his larger philosophical approach: to be of service to a community is to truly understand it from within. As someone who seeks to cross the chasm that is often imposed by cultural and linguistic differences, I find this commitment to be particularly moving. For me, studying Haitian Creole under Jacques Pierre, lecturing fellow in French, Haitian Creole and culture, has revealed how interwoven language and culture are. To study a language without consideration of the context from which it is derived — and without knowledge of the people who speak it — is to only partially engage with the language. By studying the history of Haiti and all that the country has endured, I have developed a refined perspective and a greater appreciation for the language. Farmer shared a similar reflection in that his awareness of history's consequences was not theoretical — it was born from lived experience. His time in Cange enlightened him to how damaging small decisions made in distant centers of power can be. As he recollected, “I would read stuff from scholarly texts and know they were wrong. Living in Haiti, I realized that a minor error in one setting of power and privilege could have an enormous impact on the poor in another.”Farmer’s work and legacy are still alive today. His foundational work persists through Partners In Health, an international organization that stands as a beacon of community-driven global health. His philosophy — that healthcare is a fundamental right that all humans are entitled to, not a privilege — has influenced the perspectives of generations of medical practitioners, activists and students. In light of current events in global health — most notably Trump administration’s withdrawal of “$58 billion in international foreign aid,” a figure that represents funding for “maternal and child health, nutrition, neglected tropical diseases, and global health security” in Haiti and many of the regions where Farmer dedicated his life’s work — we feel the weight of his legacy now more than ever. These reductions have real consequences that will be felt. As underscored by Wesler Lambert, the current interim executive director of Zanmi Lasante, “The potential rollback of PEPFAR support is not just a bureaucratic decision; it is a direct threat to the lives of thousands of Haitians. It risks undoing two decades of progress, jeopardizing the ability of patients to access treatment, and setting back global efforts to control HIV.”Understanding that access to healthcare should not be determined by geography, affluence or political will —but rather respected as a fundamental human right — remains one of the most imperative challenges in this moment. Haiti, a country that has endured centuries of structural violence, continues to resist, rebuild and push forward — much like the many countries worldwide that, despite spliced funding and fractured support, remain steadfast in their efforts for universal health. Given this, Farmer’s legacy imparts one clear message. Solidarity entails more than distant concern — it demands a keen eye, cultural understanding and the willingness to engage on the ground, in the language of the people. For those of us, including myself, who seek to follow in his footsteps, we must understand that global health is more than medicine: It is about history, policy decisions and the lived experiences of those who are most vulnerable. It is about holding a community's voice at the center and elevating it. I believe that the first step towards meeting this end starts with language, as it is the bridge that allows us to truly see, hear and stand alongside those we aspire to serve. As the landscape of global health continues to shift, I hope we can be reminded of Farmer’s far-reaching contributions and his vigorous aim to work with global communities on even footing.Mya Harris is a Trinity senior."
Navigating the Duke journey as a 22-year-old freshman,Myat Theingi,2025-03-05T11:00:00Z,Mar,5,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/navigating-duke-journey-22-year-old-freshman-20250305.html,"When I look in the mirror, I sometimes see a glimpse of a girl with a white duty coat and a stethoscope around her neck, ready to go to the hospital for her shift. Her life is stable, easy and comfortable, surrounded by family and friends. I was a second-year medical university student when the 2021 military coup happened in Burma. Then, I withdrew myself from my military-controlled university for the Civil Disobedience Student Movement. Afterwards, I devoted myself full time to pro-democracy activism, refugee advocacy and education for almost three years after the coup.The idea of resuming my education never really crossed my mind during those years because I was deeply engaged in meaningful work on the ground and genuinely enjoying it. However, I eventually realized that without a proper education — a college degree — there was a clear limit to how much impact and credibility my activism could have in the future and what people would perceive of it. This is especially true if I want to expand it to the global stage.So, after four years away from an academic setting, I finally decided to start college again — this time studying my true passion: politics and human rights. And, luckily, someone from the Duke Undergraduate Admission Office chose to believe in a 22-year-old student from a messed-up country with messed-up life experiences and educational background.I struggled academically because, after several years away from the traditional academic setting, my brain was no longer used to studying. So, I had to force myself to rewire my brain to adapt to this “going to classes, doing homework and taking exams” reality. I had to invest more effort into my studies just to be on the same par with my young, energetic, freshly out-of-school American peers. I spent most of my first semester overwhelmingly studying in my room while my peers were having a seemingly balanced academic and social life. At least, the grades paid off, but they severely came at the expense of my college social life and fun activities.Worse, the social struggle hit me harder. I have struggled to make reliable friends because of my “old” age. Things are all fine until the topic of age comes into the conversation. There is always some level of awkwardness and distance between my peers and me after they learn how old I am. Seeing a freshman even older than a senior is clearly not the norm here. And of course, they mostly want same-age peers. It is all natural, easy and comfortable. I never fully understood that an age gap automatically creates a disconnect in relationships. I am still Gen Z. I listen to the same music, keep up with the same trends, and know pretty much everything my 18-year-old peers do. People even say I could easily pass as 18 — probably thanks to my Asian genes and, of course, my trusty hair bangs. So, on the surface, nothing is setting me apart. I thought blending in would be effortless. I was too naïve to think things would be that simple.A deep emotional intelligence and maturity level often comes with age and lived experience. People who have faced real difficulties usually develop resilience and perspective, which shows in how they handle challenges and navigate life with a sense of quiet wisdom that feels different from those who have not been tested in the same way. I have realized this concept firsthand through several human connections with my younger friends at Duke.Since many of my peers usually come from privileged family backgrounds and are from prosperous and peaceful countries, many have not faced struggles like mine (yet). On top of that, they are still teenagers — an age known for being impulsive and unpredictable. So, I have felt firsthand how they often act purely on emotion, usually without considering the damaging impact of their volatile words and actions on meaningful relationships — and it always breaks my heart.Additionally, as we grow older, our priorities shift, sometimes drastically, from what we once wanted. So, for many of my peers, college is about exploring, pushing boundaries, and embracing that “young, wild and free” lifestyle. For me, it is about making the most of every opportunity, never taking anything for granted and staying focused and serious on my personal and bigger mission for my people. Also at the same time, my peers chase fun, adventure and new experiences — constantly trying out new things or new relationships — I long for stability, peace of mind and deeper, more committed connections.It is not that either of us is wrong; we are just on completely different wavelengths, according to our significantly different lived experiences. Of course, there are always exceptions, and I would love to meet a few people who do not fit this general pattern. However, it could also be unfair or too much to expect mature attitudes and behaviors from teenagers. So, I have come to accept that I cannot blame anyone for this; it is what it is.Whenever I complain about social problems, my parents and friends from Burma offer me some advice: don’t reveal my actual age to anyone.But one thing I hate the most in the world is hiding my true self and living in lies. Not disclosing my age would also mean hiding my resilient past — a core part of my identity. So, it is better to face the truth and live freely, although it might also mean isolation, than to surround myself with people I cannot even share my age with because that might upset them. The right people will still choose me regardless of our so-called age gaps. I just need to be lucky enough to find them.Of course, despite the struggles, I am still grateful for everything I have right now. When life challenges us, we only have two options: let it crush us or rise above it and fight back — and I always try to fight back. I always remind myself that these challenges make me more resilient and grounded in my life missions.The girl from the mirror and I have led different paths. I still think about her sometimes, but I also know that despite everything, I would choose this path again. After all, even when the road is uncertain and the weight of my choices feels heavy, I know I am exactly where I am meant to be right now.Myat Theingi is a Trinity first-year from Burma.

How language subjugates women: The hidden sexism in titles,Aria Dwoskin,2025-03-05T11:00:00Z,Mar,5,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/language-subjugates-women-titles-20250305.html,"Margaret Atwood’s 1985 “The Handmaid’s Tale” stunned the nation with its depiction of women, who were reduced to mere reproductive instruments. Women, in this novel, no longer bore their names. Those who were not directly involved with the reproductive scene were assigned titles depending on their role, from Aunts to Marthas. More disturbingly, women who served as handmaids were named after the men they served. The main character is a handmaid to a man named Fred, and thus referred to as Offred (which quite simply means Of Fred). Women, then, were marked not by their own identity, but by the men they were bound to. This labeling of women relative to a man seems draconian. Yet, in a way, this is precisely what America does.The first way our country enforces these labels is becoming increasingly recognized: last names. Every single woman in America has inherited a man’s last name. Even when women keep their last name — which is becoming more prevalent with today’s feminist movements — they are keeping their father’s last name, or one their mother got from her father. No woman in the U.S. has a last name originating from a woman.The other layer of labeling women in a demeaning manner is deeply overlooked, yet it is preserved through the use of honorifics. Honorifics are the titles we refer to everyone by, from parents to teachers to strangers. For men, this is Mr., whereas for women this varies from Miss, to Ms. and Mrs. These titles are taken as is — since birth, all of us have, without question, referred to the people around us with their respective honorifics. This system, though, is deeply flawed, as there is acute sexism embedded within honorifics. Womens’ honorifics shift based on their age and/or marital status. In English, unmarried women under 30 are referred to as Miss. Unmarried women over 30 are referred to as Ms. And married women, regardless of age, are referred to as Mrs. This effectively categorizes women by their age group and relationship status. Men, on the other hand, remain Mr. throughout their entire life, regardless of their age or marital status. Society defining women in relation to a man not only reflects outdated, sexist tropes, but also perpetuates a traditional, heteronormative framework.Worse, this is not just an American problem. Many languages, including French, Spanish and Italian, also address women based on their marital status. These linguistic conventions reflect and reinforce patriarchal ideologies of possessivity and subjection, which is detrimental for women around the world.This language shapes our societal attitudes and, simply, how we define women.On a purely psychological level, the impacts of this language can be understood through Benjamin Whorf’s theory of linguistic determinism. This theory suggests that language limits and determines how we think, thus shaping our thoughts and perceptions. When women are continuously labeled in ways that subject them to men, it reinforces a way of thinking where women’s identities are both tied to and viewed as secondary to men. This framework reinforces gender inequality and skews power dynamics, shaping our perceptions of gender at a subconscious level.Furthermore, schema theory proposes that all people organize knowledge in our brains by unconsciously forming categories known as schemas. This classification process not only allows humans to process the vast amount of information we encounter daily, but also leads to the organization of data through generalizations. Honorifics and last-name traditions, then, reinforce gender-based schemas, categorizing women based on their age and relation to men, while men are categorized as is. This linguistic distinction perpetuates gender biases and subjugation. Lastly, it is crucial not to overlook the influence of ideology in this discussion. Louis Althusser describes ideology as “a ‘representation’ of the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence.” Simply put, our perception of reality is a result of societal norms and beliefs. This in turn influences how all people view each other. Honorifics repeatedly define women by their ties to a man, reinforcing a harmful ideology: Women may internalize a sense of inferiority based on how society refers to them, while others may subconsciously perceive women as subordinate to men. This pattern has persisted both historically and in the present. We live in a world riddled with sexism, with patriarchal ideologies woven into our institutions, language and norms.For one, the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report collected an index on gender social norms in 2020. The Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI) evaluates how certain ideologies hinder gender equality in political and employment arenas across the world. It found that around 50% of people believe men are more suited for political leadership, and 28% believe that a man physically harming his wife is justifiable. These figures — both deeply disturbing — reveal the persistent dismissal and devaluation of women. These mindsets are amplified through our language structures, perpetuating systemic inequalities in many facets of our lives.One in every six women in America has experienced either attempted or completed rape during their lifetime. In American workplaces, the gender wage gap remains prevalent: In 2023, women workers made 75 cents for every dollar a male worker made. Even more, the United States’ healthcare system fails women. Female health is widely neglected; research on women’s health is underfunded, and women are not accurately represented in clinical trials. The U.S. has the highest rate of maternal mortality than any other high-income country.These gendered disparities do not exist in a vacuum. Rather, they stem from the demeaning linguistic frameworks society uses to define women. While this is not the only part of our world that is deeply embedded with bigotry, it is one that plays a powerful role in subconsciously shaping our perceptions and prejudices.Some may dismiss this analysis as oversensitive, claiming society has become too “woke” and language is being overly scrutinized. I counter this by emphasizing that language is the building block of society. Our words matter and they hold power. If something as fundamental as language continues to categorize women in a subjugated way, true gender equality will always remain out of reach. We must be sensitive to harmful language and cognizant in how it further entrenches bigoted norms.In “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the labeling of handmaids is inherently possessive, and this structure is not confined to fiction. English mirrors this skewed dynamic through the use of honorifics and last name traditions. Take Offred’s name and compare it to any married woman in America: “Of” serves the same purpose as “Mrs.”, and “Fred” serves the same purpose as any American last name, which irrefutably has male roots. Yet we are so embedded in this chauvinistic framework that we often fail to recognize the glaring parallels within our own society.Ideology creates a tainted picture of our subjectivity and reality. This distorted picture then makes oppressive structures appear seemingly natural and inevitable, and thus unchangeable. This is an illusion. Ideologies shift, as can language. The norms they perpetuate are not inevitable. We have the power to challenge and reshape them. The first step in this is awareness: recognizing the ways language diminishes women and their autonomy. By acknowledging these harmful structures, we can move toward a more equal society.Aria Dwoskin is a Trinity first-year. Her pieces typically run on alternate Sundays."
What’s fizzin’?,Adam Levin,2025-03-04T11:00:00Z,Mar,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/whats-fizzin-20250304.html,"Recently, I’ve stopped my nightly routine of scrolling on TikTok before bed. Instead, I’ve taken up a far more destructive habit: checking whatever new content has dropped on Fizz in the last 24 hours. If you’re in need of a weekly recap, something like 75% of all posts have referenced one specific, uniquely successful “fizzer” on the app, and the other quarter are frat-related fizzes — including the discovery that Mike Posner was in the Sigma Nu fraternity at Duke. Yes, that Mike Posner. Yes, that Sigma Nu. Yes, the song “Cooler than Me” is definitely about a girl at Duke, and according to Fizz, a member of the Tri Delta sorority. Yes, I spent far too long on Fizz when brainstorming this article. Although we might perceive Fizz as a superficial, irrelevant app, it has an outsized impact on Duke culture. The top post on Fizz has 2,300 upvotes. Recently, the most popular posts for each week have averaged around 2,000 upvotes. Given Duke’s small student body, that number represents a non-insignificant number of undergraduates interacting with the app at least weekly. Additionally, first-years and sophomores primarily drive the app, many of whom tend to be more active participants in campus culture than upper-level students. It’s not shocking that so many students, especially first-year students, are active on the platform. It’s often the first place I hear about new developments on campus, whether it’s the fire in Blue Zone or the recent reports of a Kappa Alpha (KA) member eating a live fish on camera. It also offers an easy way to start a conversation with people. If someone tells me they’re in Economics 201, I can reference any of the 200 posts I’ve seen about Professor Boczon, or her dog, Watson; if I’m walking past the never-ending East Campus construction, I’ll comment that I can’t wait for the lazy river. However, the app also provides an inaccurate picture of Duke culture — a breeding ground for Greek life and economics major-centered content on a platform that loves public shaming and celebrates people for demonstrated apathy. According to my tally system, almost a quarter of the top 100 posts on Fizz are related to Greek life, significantly outpacing any other post category. This disproportionate representation of Greek life makes sense. Those involved in Greek life might desire a more public social life and be likelier to post on Fizz. At the same time, discussing events like major parties or Greek life scandals provides a common denominator for many students to engage with: in short, it’s relatable. Yet this Fizz content also reinforces a system in which students view Greek life as the only option for Duke’s social life. These posts don’t just come after a huge party or major scandal but are a constant reality on the app. And not everyone is happy. About half as often as I come across a post dunking on KA, releasing a new frat ranking or discussing the Pi Beta Phi new member education program, I see a post complaining about the discussion of Greek life on Fizz. Given Fizz’s impact on Duke culture, if you don’t understand the nuanced intricacies of Fizz frat drama or the latest update on a random student elevated to the status of Fizz celebrity, you might feel alienated from your friends and the broader Duke community. While obviously, Fizz is not the primary distributor of social capital at Duke, the white and higher-income individuals more likely to join Greek organizations are also more likely to be in touch with the conversations about Fizz and “Duke culture.”Furthermore, the anonymity offered by the platform allows for a greater toxic culture to flourish. Because students do not have to attach their name to their posts, users seem to share an unabashed willingness to shame others publicly. For example, if you engage in a socially unacceptable behavior, have an awkward picture posted by some of your friends or even write an unpopular article, you might be forever immortalized within campus culture. Such unrelenting notoriety isn’t an exaggeration: The most popular post on Fizz for over a year has been a picture of an Alpha Tau Omega pledge awkwardly trying to dap up Mark Mitchell, a post recreated in a painting currently hanging up in the Gilbert-Addoms dorm. In one of the worst cases, after an Economics 201 exam, people publicly mocked students based on their low scores, sharing their unique ID with the entire Duke community. The public nature of Fizz exacerbates Duke’s panopticon effect: If you feel that you are constantly watched, and always at risk of being posted, publicly shamed and immortalized, you’re more likely to self-censor your behavior. I’ve had so many conversations with my friends where after one of us, seriously or not, proposed an out-of-the-box idea, the immediate response was, “you are going to BLOW UP on Fizz.” At an institution with an already strong pre-professional, somewhat conformist culture, the Fizz app only further instills the values of palatability and popular appeal within Duke students.This culture of constant surveillance doesn’t just regulate “abnormal” behavior, but also shames people for actually caring. For example, the recent pro-Palestinian tenters on Bryan Center Plaza were ridiculed for “blasting sounds” and asked to “stop killing vibes” — which makes sense, because protests famously intend to be non-disruptive and vibey. However, I don’t mean to pick on one relatively small post. After the election, a hugely upvoted swath of posts explained that the election wasn’t that deep and criticized any politically related Fizz post. During an economics lecture, a student who challenged Nechyba about the extent to which his vote mattered faced ridicule with a hilariously unique Soyboy and Chad meme in the year 2024. Yes, public advocacy always invites some level of ridicule and backlash; however, the anonymity and large platform provided by Fizz celebrates apathy and indifference. Look, I get it. Fizz is a gossip app. Gossip apps are built to mock, discuss stupid frat drama and elevate whatever is popular at the time. I’m not arguing to get rid of Fizz — my screen time on the app would betray me if I did — I’m asking everyone to be more cognizant of what you upvote and post on the app. Fizz has a more significant impact on our culture than we like to admit, so before you engage, just ask yourself: What idea am I elevating with my upvote and is it worth the five seconds of enjoyment I got from this post?Adam Levin is a Trinity first-year.

The calculated ambush on Zelenskyy that shook the world,Leo Goldberg,2025-03-04T11:00:00Z,Mar,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/calculated-ambush-zelenskyy-20250304.html,"There are very few occasions nowadays when an event in the news moves me to the point of feeling genuinely strong emotion. I, like most other people, have grown accustomed and indifferent to the current media cycle of political dramas and sensationalist stories which we may glance at, roll our eyes and move on from — very rarely does a news story cause me to break from this pattern. On Friday, though, watching President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance ambush Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House made me absolutely furious. The amount of irresponsible and objectionable things Donald Trump says and does, and editorial pieces and responses that accompany them, quickly become banal and boring to follow. This can easily give the impression that his actions all constitute the same insignificant quality of general badness. But Trump’s meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday marked something much more sinister. It signified a moment in history where America’s current role in the world has begun to unravel, and that no country can count on the United States as a reliable ally any longer. Zelenskyy was invited to the Oval Office on Friday to discuss a rare earth minerals deal with Trump as a means for securing further US support in the war against Russia, and was subsequently subjected to a shameful berating rarely seen in public diplomacy. Never before has a sitting U.S. president invited the leader of another country to the White House with the stated aim of conducting diplomacy and proceeded to insult and taunt them on national television. The new expectation established on Friday — that world leaders must perform demeaning overtures of fealty to America at the expense of their dignity to maintain their alliance — was sickening to watch. I’ve hardly felt so ashamed of my country as when witnessing our national leadership humiliate the people of Ukraine through its president. Our aid to Ukraine now appears to depend on its leader’s willingness to be a sycophant.The meeting flipped America’s usual motivation for providing aid to allies on its head. When Zelenskyy very prudently and correctly pointed out the negative effects which the U.S. would feel from Russia’s increased influence were Ukraine to capitulate to their demands, (an unbelievably generous gesture to even think about the interests of the U.S. while the people of Ukraine are fighting for their lives), Trump told him, “You’re in no position to dictate how we’re going to feel. You’re not in a very good position right now. You have no cards.” No cards? The nerve to say this to a man who has been on the frontlines with his people fighting one of the strongest armies in the world and still managed to hold his country’s ground is contemptible. More substantially though, what the U.S. is now implying is that it is willing to abandon its friends and let them perish if they lack strategic military advantage (as in Ukraine's current military setbacks) or are unwilling to concede to authoritarian coercion (meaning surrendering partial sovereignty to the aggressor as in Russia’s territorial demands on Ukraine). I shudder to imagine how the world may have turned out had this same policy been applied to support for Britain and France in the 1940s. Trump continued to accuse Zelenskyy of “gambling with the lives of millions of people and with WW3.” With this, another shocking new precedent in diplomacy has been set, as America is now suggesting that recipients of war aid are fair game for being held at fault for the conflict. In other words, Zelenskyy is responsible for the lives and consequences of the war, not Vladimir Putin, who, it is absurd now to even feel the need to say, is the actual one gambling with millions of lives and global stability.This was all before Vance, in his characteristically weasel-like manner, bizarrely lectured Zelenskyy that it was “disrespectful” to turn up at a meeting at the White House and try to accurately explain the situation of his country (which, amazingly, as Zelenskyy again rightly pointed out, Vance has never been to). World leaders watching this exchange will surely now think twice about accepting an invitation to the White House if such an act could be distorted and held against them as impertinent.Vance then asked Zelenskyy, “Have you said thank you once this entire meeting?” This self-inflated, insecure, narcissistic question uttered by Vance was beyond insulting. Imagine if the President of France were to invite the U.S. President to the Palais de l’Élysée and proceed to demand he give thanks to him and his country for sending the French fleet to Yorktown in 1781 (which is the real reason why the United States won the revolutionary war) under the threat of suspending life-sustaining aid? We’d all be rightly appalled. More broadly though, Vance’s question undermines the very principles on which American diplomacy is based. Before the arrival of Trump's second term, it was understood regarding American statecraft that the provision of foreign aid was always a tradeoff. The benefits which the receiving country were to gain from the aid may not always pay an exact dividend back to America, but we firmly accepted this with the knowledge that supporting our allies against aggression and tyranny was worth it in itself. The thanks is returned in watching our money advance what is deemed advantageous to us. There was never the expectation of nations to perform debasing displays of servility to America and its president as a condition for US support. To this, Vance and Trump have decided a self-aggrandizing ego boost is preferable.The White House ambush on Zelenskyy marks a dark turning point not only in who the United States considers an ally, but the way in which current allies and world leaders can expect to be treated by the current administration. The damage that this affair will do to our global partnerships is incalculable, and world leaders have already expressed their shock at the meeting. The leaders of France, Spain and Lithuania have all voiced support for Ukraine in clear contradistinction with Trump. What we are now witnessing is a fundamental realignment in American foreign policy for the worse. For the U.S. to suddenly sympathize with Vladimir Putin and authoritarianism against reliable European allies and democratically-elected governments is a sad moment for our country — which everyone, regardless of political ideology, ought to recognize. Just yesterday, Trump suspended all military aid to Ukraine, and the consequences for the country, and the world, will be dire. It’s hard to know which is more disgraceful: that Trump is willingly conceding the sovereignty of our allies to the regime of Putin abroad, or that he is attempting to model his presidency on the governing style of Putin at home. To anyone who may say that Trump has even an iota of a point that Ukraine is not worth fighting for, and is a waste of U.S. money, I want to point out what I hope is self-evident: safeguarding the world against chaos, war and authoritarianism, and fighting to preserve democracy, freedom and everything our country stands is worth every penny. I challenge you to name a better cause to finance than supporting an entire people against extinction, while delivering a bloody nose to the ruthless thug Vladimir Putin. Where are your priorities for god’s sake? It’s easy now to fall into a state of helplessness and despair over watching the values of freedom, democracy and decency erode under the complete self-certainty and ignorance of the current administration, a state I admittedly found myself falling into quite a lot in recent months. But I was reminded on Friday for the first time in a long time never to lose that anger against political callousness and stupidity. This is the fight we’re up against now, between deciding if we stand in defense of freedom, democracy and everything else worth fighting for against tyranny and aggression, or if we will willingly embrace authoritarian bullying as the new acceptable form of global diplomacy. I sincerely hope that after all of this, our country will still know which side to choose.Leo Goldberg is a Trinity first-year. His pieces typically run on alternate Mondays."
Ashes for action,Luke A. Powery,2025-03-03T11:00:00Z,Mar,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/ashes-for-action-20250303.html,"An important day in the life of the Christian liturgical calendar is Ash Wednesday, which is this Wednesday, March 5. Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent, which is the forty-day journey “in the wilderness” leading up to Easter. On Ash Wednesday, we, humans, remember that we are dust and to dust we will return. As said by clergy at many graveside services, “ashes to ashes, dust to dust.” On Ash Wednesday, we remember that we are ashes — mortal — as actual ashes are placed on our foreheads as a reminder of this humbling reality. The ashes represent mortality but also mourning, penitence and repentance. Lent is a liturgical time of “giving up.” Often during Lent, one might “give up” something like chocolate or social media or watching sports on TV or some other beloved activity. This type of fasting is a spiritual practice in which people “give up” something as a sign of “giving up” themselves to God. In the Bible, the fifty-eighth chapter of the book of Isaiah describes how the people of Israel engage in this type of fast as good religious people do. They abstain from food and wear sackcloth and ashes as a sign of mourning and penance. They are liturgically literate and ritually right. They want to draw closer to God, and this is the way they know how to do it. But this is the spiritual irony — they seem to move farther away from God as they dive deeper into themselves. They can’t figure out why their fasting won’t work, and so they ask, “Why do we fast, but you do not see? Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?” They can’t figure out what’s wrong with their fast diet until they are told: “You serve your own interest on your fast day and oppress all your workers. Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to strike with a wicked fist. Such fasting as you do today will not make your voice heard on high.” The critique here is that their fast diet is an abstention, not just from food, but from others. They delight in the divine but ignore human beings. They abstain from loving their neighbor, revealing how a ritual ethic can become disconnected from a righteous ethic in life. Fasting in their way leads them toward ethical negligence because it has become self-serving. The idea of “giving up” is problematized through an emphasis on “giving to” others. This becomes clear when the meaning of fasting in this episode is reimagined to include such things as “to loose the bonds of injustice,” “to let the oppressed go free” and “to share your bread with the hungry.” Fasting, as redefined here, is not being drawn more into oneself but being drawn outward toward others. It is selfless service; thus, the imposition of ashes on foreheads should never be severed from service in the world. Contemplation should never eschew action.If there is ever any abstention in fasting, it should be the abstaining from indifference, inactivity, egotism and injustice. In his sermon “Three Dimensions of a Complete Life,” the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. preached, “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, what are you doing for others?” Go ahead and have ashes placed on your foreheads, but know that those ashes are a call to action.The Rev.

The value of the commute,Marc Wang,2025-03-02T11:00:00Z,Mar,2,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/value-of-commute-20250302.html,"A friend once remarked to me that the ideal university would be a single building comprising a multitude of rooms. Lecture theaters, dormitories and cafeterias would be spread over the wide expanse of its many floors, with the location of one place never more than an elevator’s ride away from any other. The point was, he said, that there would be little time lost to commuting in such a place: One would simply step from one class to another, from the library to the lecture, and so on. This was strange given who it came from. My friend attends an ornate institution on the Scottish coast, echoing with the churn of waves and set within miles of open country landscape — the sort of place I would long to visit. I failed to see how a ten-minute walk to a morning lecture, making one’s way against heady winds carrying the smell of sea brine, could be disagreeable to anyone. And yet it is easy to understand. Efficiency is all the buzz these days. The commute hinders productivity by filling useful hours with dead time. The world at large is hurtling toward an ever more complete elimination of the in-between, with work-from-home schemes and takeaway deliveries reducing the idle moments of travel and waiting so that we can get on with more. And it is the same with our lives at Duke: We have surely all reasoned at one time or another that it would be more efficient not to go to lectures, or wished we could do without the West-to-East commute. Pragmatically speaking, some division between events is absolutely necessary. A break soothes the creases of mental burden and prepares us to begin something new. The question is whether the breaks should take the form of a commute — which is, after all, a purely transitional exercise, the very manifestation of physical constraint, with little opportunity to be productive or even to catch a snooze. In the best case, the journey between our engagements is spent with friends in delighted conversation, but in the worst case, it is the source of much tired grumbling and a draining effort that we long to get over with. But a stretch of time that forcibly precludes any pursuit of what is typically considered “useful” is also valuable in and of itself. The physical impossibility of squeezing every last drop of time during a journey for lecture preparations, sending emails and binging shows gives the mind crucial time for consolidation. Such was my experience last semester when, for two days each week, travelling after my physics lecture to an evening philosophy seminar on East Campus, too exhausted to even look at my phone, I would mentally play over events from the previous class. Trees, streetlamps and houses passed before my eyes as I wrestled with concepts and equations and phenomena, noting connections and posing counterfactual situations, trying to fit everything together in my head. The inability to examine my notes or even to write on a piece of paper, far from hindering my study, enabled me to develop my physics intuition to a remarkable degree.I was in for a realization. The constraints of the commute force us to reconsider the view that we must always be actively doing something and allow us to get down to the thing itself: the intellectual strain and exhilaration of holding an idea in one’s head for sustained probing. The time for reflection which the commute affords is important in another way, in that it spurs inspiration. How often is it that we have been stuck on a problem or felt ourselves out of ideas, and a few steps from the desk proves to be all it takes to come up with the solution? A change of pace, an alteration of scenery, is sometimes all we need to restore our minds to full working order.Perhaps it might be said that this idea of receptiveness to inspiration is only applicable to essay-writing in the humanities, and that for mathematics and the hard sciences, what is needed is an uninterrupted span of time for grinding through problem sets. Long walks and leisurely rumination are the stuff of poets, we tend to think, whereas the STEM major must confine himself to his work desk and “lock in.” Yet even here, the presence in our study time of some form of physical movement or commute promises benefits: Did it not take a trip to the island of Helgoland for Heisenberg to formulate his matrix mechanics approach, and was it not on a Greyhound bus that Freeman Dyson resolved the then-fundamental conundrum in quantum electrodynamics?At the core of all this is a different view of efficiency — one that does not revolve purely around plugging times on either side of a division sign, as if the brain were a machine running on a constant clock cycle, but that is attuned to how the human mind really works. “The zipper displaces the button and man lacks just that much time to think while dressing,” so goes the line from Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451.” What saves us time, which we at first consider efficient, may turn out to actually deprive us of invaluable moments for inspired thought and contemplation. The wider picture is that there is value in living our lives to the constraints of physical rhythms, to order our narratives around commutes and distinct locations, as opposed to idealizing a dull uniformity as the peak of productive life. We should therefore relish the expansive physical environment that Duke provides. Marc Wang is a Trinity sophomore."
Duke has a spending problem: Invest in students not aesthetics,Noor Nazir,2025-02-28T11:00:00Z,Feb,28,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-spending-problem-students-aesthetics-20250228.html,"I owe my Blue Devil title to financial aid. I don’t order from Doordash, I rarely dine out and I spend my work-study earnings on flights to Pakistan and flex points for laundry. People tell me this must be tough, that I must be broke. But I don’t see it that way. I am lucky just to be here: It is financial aid that makes enrollment possible for me. The reality is that for most students, affording Duke is a challenge, even with financial aid. If you don’t have access to resources beyond what’s considered “demonstrated need,” attending can feel like an impossible stretch.The median family income of a Duke student is $186,700, with 69% coming from the top 20% of earners. Only 1.6% of students come from low-income backgrounds. This financial homogeneity is reflected in campus culture — as reported by The Chronicle in 2023. Many students describe wealth as “ubiquitous” at Duke, shaping practically every corner of the University. In The Chronicle report, then-sophomore Carly Pyles said, ""I thought I had already been exposed to the highest levels of affluence. In my opinion, Duke is at a whole new level.” There have to be others who feel the same. And if even the students from privileged backgrounds are surprised by Duke’s wealth, it’s clear that the University has to do something about its lack of financial diversity.Duke claims to meet 100% of demonstrated need, but that need is based on institutional formulas that may not always be favorable. Even in a best-case scenario of an ordinary American citizen — owning a home, having no other children enrolled college, and both parents together — a family earning $80,610 per year would still be expected to contribute $6,200 to $20,100 per year, according to Duke’s own Tuition Calculator(assuming tuition is $89,600). In calculating this estimate, I also assumed that the household had only $25,000 in savings, no retirement assets and a $350,000 homewith a $200,000 mortgage in any U.S. state. When considering a holistic portfolio of household expenses — such as the need to accumulate retirement savings and make mortgage payments — the size of these tuition contributions can create significant financial strain. It is well documented that, even after financial aid, middle-class families are often left with bills that stretch their finances. While Duke’s aid significantly reduces the full assumed cost of attendance, it doesn’t eliminate the burden or student loans to the extent it really can. After nearly two years at Duke, I’ve realized that the University itself has a spending problem, and this money can be utilized to do something about the lack of financial diversity at the institution. But, instead of prioritizing affordability, it pours millions into unnecessary renovations — Lilly Library, the Lobby Shop, Wilson Gym, Abele Quad and so on. Duke’s spending problem isn’t new and is overdue for a rethink. The Brodhead Center renovation alone cost $150 million, transforming the student union into a high-end dining space while food prices on campus remained high. The Lilly Library renovation is projected to cost $64 million by 2027, and Wallace Wade Stadium underwent costly renovations with no publicly available final price tag (we can reasonably assume it was in the millions). Duke has previously spent $15 million on Baldwin Auditorium renovations, and another $15 million on the Bryan Center. The University also invested $30 million into Duke Gardens renovations. These renovations are just the latest chapter in Duke’s long tradition of rebuilding what was never broken.These projects may make Duke’s pathways more picturesque, but they ignore the students who should be walking them.I don’t want to be unfair. The University does allocate 23% of its endowment toward financial aid. But if the University’s student diversity severely lacks financial representation, perhaps that is not enough. I'm no math major, but I crunched the numbers … and somehow, the University doesn’t see this, or is ignorant toward this ridiculously obvious truth: For every $1 million Duke spends on renovations, they can most likely add two more students to their full scholarship program (With Duke's cost of attendance now at $92,042 per year, a four-year degree costs approximately $368,168. That means every $1 million spent elsewhere could fully fund about 2.7 students — rounding down, that’s at least two more students who could attend without financial burden.)Let's put that in perspective: If Duke had not begun renovating Lilly Library, it could’ve directed those funds to fully fund the tuition of 128 students for all four years. If Duke reallocated Broadhead Center’s $150 million in renovations toward expanding need-based scholarship programs or curbing tuition hikes, 300 students could attend Duke without any financial burden. Again, these calculations assume $1 million can pay for at least 2 students. This issue is more urgent than ever: a 5.93% increase in the undergraduate cost of attendance was just recently approved by the Board of Trustees. Where is the money going, and why is tuition still rising — outpacing inflation — despite a $11.9 billion endowment?The University has plenty of options: invest more endowment funds in financial aid, make the definition of “demonstrated need” more flexible, curb tuition hikes or maybe stop the never-ending renovations of Abele Quad — still a mystery to students. Options also include expanding the Robertson Scholars Leadership Program from 25-30 students per year to at least 50 and increasing the Benjamin N. Duke Scholarship from 10-12 recipients to at least 20. While these are merit-based programs, Duke has the capacity to expand financial aid across both need and merit-based scholarships. I suggest double-digit increases, but the University’s capacity is far greater.I am not arguing for Duke to follow other elitist institutions simply because there islittle to follow. I argue for Duke to lead by example by expanding need-based scholarship programs, and going beyond demonstrated need, like no other university has before. The new meaning of the “Duke Difference” may just be to prioritize affordability over aesthetics.This change may just change a student’s life. I understand exclusivity regarding low acceptance rates, but I fail to understand that when it comes to granting scholarships. After all, Duke has one of the biggest endowments in the country. Some may argue that campus upgrades attract donors, but what good is a beautiful campus if inaccessible to thousands of qualified students? If Duke truly values excellence, it should invest in the students who make it great.If the argument is that endowment funds are constrained by donor intent, then the question isn’t just about money — it’s about priorities. Duke has a responsibility to shape the donor conversation rather than passively accept restrictions that reinforce exclusivity.Donors don't act in a vacuum; they respond to the University's vision and leadership. If Duke treated financial accessibility as an urgent priority — on par with naming buildings or funding niche research — donors could follow. The same institution that successfully secures millions for new infrastructure could at least try to apply that same energy in securing unrestricted financial aid funds.I won’t negate the larger debate on private institutions, legacy admissions or Duke’s low international student rates — that’s an op-ed for another day. But for now, one thing is clear: Duke owes it to the hard-working high school students dreaming of a world-class education to invest more in them than in aesthetics.Ultimately, while I do owe my Blue Devil title to financial aid and I recognize my privilege in even having that opportunity, I also recognize the millions of students who never got the chance to even make it here — not because they weren’t smart enough, but because Duke chose to make its campus more beautiful rather than make college more affordable.So, Duke — why prioritize stone and steel over the students who should, or are, walking through them?Noor Nazir is a Trinity sophomore.

An Instagram post is not enough to ‘save research’,Coral Lin,2025-02-28T11:00:00Z,Feb,28,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/instagram-post-not-save-research-20250228.html,"On a random Friday morning, a few weeks after President Donald Trump’s executive order freezing federal grants and the National Institutes for Health (NIH) announced research funding slashes, Duke did something very strange. Rather than publish a formal press release, the university posted a four-slide infographic on its Instagram, asking “What if federal funding is cut?”. Citing the impact federal funding has on North Carolina’s research-driven economy and Duke’s reliance on NIH funds, Duke seemed to understand the grave implications that the Trump administration’s actions have on the university, the health system and the state. On four out of five graphics, there was an ominous platitude written: “Duke research saves lives. Now we need to save research.”Okay — except, who exactly is Duke referring to when it talks about “us” and “we”? And who are we saving research from, and why?The key details that this non-call to action obscures leaves Duke portrayed a victim of an unknown villain rather than an institution with influence across the state, the country and the world. If Duke wants to take the position that federal funding cuts are detrimental (which they are), then the university should not only admit it is not exactly a victim in need of saving, but also that these cuts are a direct result of the Trump administration, or at the very least, the federal government. The University's position on the federal funding freeze is only the latest example of where Duke can and must do more in their position of immense power. By making a weak and vague statement that lacks accountability, the institution helps create an environment where its administration, students, faculty, staff and beneficiaries can feel helpless.In reality, the Duke community benefits from its status as part of an elite institution with plentiful resources and a national platform. Duke boasts a large and powerful alumni network, a strong history of organizing and a student body of future leaders (and whose research, personal lives and employment prospects are affected by politics more than ever before). Not to mention the university’s D.C. office, situated strategically to secure federal funds and grants. In choosing to be apolitical in its select statements, Duke undermines its own institutional goals, harming the entire Duke community. Notably, the statement on federal funding focuses only on NIH funding cuts affecting science and health research, failing to mention federal funding freezes and potential cuts that affect other areas. This leaves its international students, students who receive federal aid, trans students, undocumented students, social science and humanities researchers and its own Climate Commitment, among other priorities, in the dust. While Duke’s mission supports“knowledge in service of society,” its relative silence runs completely counter by allowing the federal government to disrupt and destroy the University’s pipeline for future researchers, public servants and thought leaders. I am inspired by all that the Duke community has achieved: the world-class research, medical advances and wonderful alumni network are to be envied. This is why I know we can do better.While the University may argue that quiet, behind-the-scenes policymaking is preferable given President Trump’s threats of retribution, this can’t be the only course of action. Duke need not make the loudest public statement, but it must devise a strategy to empower the community, not just put their head down and take it. We, nor Duke’s research mission, are not in need of saving. Rather, our Duke community has the people and power needed to resist the Trump agenda. I also ask the Duke community to support each other through this time of uncertainty — not only through conversing through our fears and unease, but also by making our voices known to our administrators and elected representatives, such as Senators Ted Budd and Thom Thillis. We can’t afford to sit back and wait another four years for things to change.Coral Lin is a Trinity senior."
"Streamlining research is a worthy goal, but the NIH cuts are dangerous and misguided",Alex Berkman,2025-02-27T11:00:00Z,Feb,27,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/streamlining-research-worthy-cuts-dangerous-misguided-20250227.html,"On Feb. 7, under the directive of President Donald Trump, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) enacted a policy change that could significantly alter the landscape of academic research—capping indirect costs on all current and future NIH grants at 15%. To clarify: When a lab receives an NIH grant, it also receives an additional percentage of that total amount to cover “indirect costs” associated with research — more formally termed Facilities & Administrative (F&A) rates. To get a sense, indirect costs cover expenses like building maintenance, utilities, administrative work and other operational overhead that support research but are not directly tied to specific project activities. For example a university that has negotiated an indirect cost rate of 30%, a $100,000 grant would include an additional $30,000 to cover expenses; under the new NIH policy, this would mean a $15,000 loss for the lab. However, Duke receives just a little more than $100,000 in NIH funding. It receives ​​$580 million at an indirect cost rate of around 61%. In other words, a cap at 15% would result in a staggering $194 million loss in funding. Let’s say it how it is. Elon Musk and President Trump have now taken their DOGE-imprinted, Trump Tower-sized chainsaw to academia, and the fallout could be devastating. In an email sent from Duke's administration, including President Vincent Price, they acknowledge the harm of such a policy, stating “This abrupt shift in policy would significantly slow or halt discovery in critical areas such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, infectious diseases and pediatric health.” In Boston, a federal judge has prolonged a temporary block against this executive order, preserving the existing framework for research operations and at least granting universities a window to devise fallback strategies should the 15% cap take effect. I fear though that no preparation period may prove sufficient to sustain the caliber of groundbreaking health research currently underway. In other words, the position of the U.S. as the preeminent leader in biomedical research is under threat. Now, I beg the researchers reading this to restrain your pitchforks and torches. I say this as someone who actually intends to complete a Ph.D. in biology.I can understand the desire to lower the indirect cost rate.After all, it is no secret that the favorite word of schools like Duke is “administration.” When paperwork needs to be done, we hire more staff. If a lab mouse escapes, we don’t just set a trap—we fund a task force to pioneer “next-gen rodent retrieval systems.” And if President Price ever needs his shoes tied god-forbid, we build a department “dedicated to innovating cutting-edge strategies to craft the perfect butterfly loop.” Therefore, in theory — and I emphasize “in theory” — by capping indirect costs, such as administrative overhead, facilities and maintenance, this ensures that more grant money is allocated directly to research rather than funding institutional bureaucracy. Essentially, Trump’s 15% cap is a fat wake up call to universities to get their affairs in order and maximize research efficiency.The problem is that this wake-up call isn’t just a phone alarm or even an obnoxious 8 a.m. fire drill — it’s an atomic bomb for institutions like Duke.Labs at Duke depend heavily on indirect grant funding — it’s what keeps the lights on, the equipment running and the admin staff handling the paperwork so scientists can focus on research. At Duke, that 61.5% indirect cost rate isn’t just padding: it pays for the HVAC system that keeps cell cultures alive, the compliance officers who navigate federal regulations and the maintenance crews who fix the ancient autoclaves that sterilize our tools. Sure, in a perfect world, labs could streamline, trim the fat and redirect more cash to pipettes and petri dishes. But a hard 15% cap doesn’t allow for that gradual shift — it’s an instant cut with no adjustment period. So even if Trump and Musk are correct in their assertion that research is strangled by administrative overhead, labs must be afforded the time to adapt to this new landscape of cost cuts. That is, such a drastic and immediate reduction in grants would not only result in a slashing of “overhead,” it would lead to a slashing of biomedical research altogether. As put by Devon Cimini, a grants administrator at Florida State University, the lower rate would be “similar to forcing a company to sell a product for $10 that costs $15 to produce.” and if the cap goes into effect, “quite bluntly, there wouldn’t be much research anymore.” If Musk cannot see that, he’s either simply obtuse or blissfully ignorant. Namely, without the time to adapt to this new landscape of research, departments will be unable to carefully curate a plan for a new way forward and will be left with no other choice but to make extremely difficult cuts. Specifically, labs will be forced to scale back quietly ambitious projects — perhaps studies on gene therapies or rare conditions — as resources thin out. Ph.D. students and postdocs might see fewer opportunities (it has already been reported that the University of Pennsylvania directed department chairs to reduce graduate admissions and rescind acceptances), with positions trimmed to fit shrinking budgets, while funding for basic supplies or software dwindles. For heavily funded labs conducting breakthrough research in disease, a substantial reduction in funding might mean pausing a promising lead or delaying a trial, subtly eroding the momentum of discovery before a new balance can even be found.Although predicting the exact changes ahead for Duke is certainly challenging and may not even be worth speculating until we know more, one thing is for certain: imposing a 15% cap on indirect costs would fundamentally reshape biomedical research — and not for the better. For as we know, malignant cancers, degenerative neurological diseases, swift and kniving infectious pathogens, chronic obesity and all the other diseases WORTH studying will not be so kind as to slow their rampant spread to accommodate OUR need to adapt. So, let us not be so foolish to forget why we do science and why we are so committed to pushing it forward. Though I suppose it is not you who needs to hear that. It’s the White House.

My losing battle against AI cheating,Orin Starn,2025-02-27T11:00:00Z,Feb,27,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/losing-battle-ai-cheating-20250227.html,"I cheated in high school physics.Our world-weary teacher gave fill-in-the-bubble multiple-choice tests. For easy grading, he always arranged the correct marks in a pattern — an upside-down V, a diagonal slash. I’d steal a glance at a smart kids’ answer sheet to set my bubbles for a perfect score. Students have always cheated. It’s a time saver, not to mention the Bart Simpson bad boy buzz of outsmarting the authorities. Skipping class, stealing tests, and other hijinks to beer pong on is the stuff of great classic comedy like Animal House and Cheats. I’ve had students copying from their seatmates and much more over my three long decades here at the Gothic Wonderland. A men’s basketball star once slipped a signed picture of himself under a colleague’s door instead of the final paper that was due, although that more attempted bribery than cheating.The Duke pressure cooker doesn’t help. If you’re stressed by a million other obligations — and expected to get straight As, land that prize internship or, if an athlete, to spend forty hours a week on your sport — cheating can feel like the only way to get things done.You might even save enough time to watch that TikTok of miniature chihuahuas on a water slide. But AI changes everything. I’m not a fan of tests, and my classes are heavy on writing assignments. Consulting AI for aid in understanding concepts is fine, but I ask students to do the class readings and write their papers in their own words. I cling to the hoary belief in the value of learning to read, think and make an argument on your own. You’ll use those human skills no matter whether you go into medicine, the law, finance, education, tech or the other classic Duke destinations.You learn zero from plugging a prompt into AI and uploading it as your essay.That hasn’t kept my students from their ChatGPT and Essay Genius. Despite bold caps syllabus prohibitions and lecture hall warnings in my best scary voice, the number of AI-generated assignments is rising. I’ve had eight cases and counting between my two classes this semester — and doubtless missed others.Studies show the same AI-cheating trend nationwide. At our fair university by my unscientific sample, most of the cheaters are men, whether from finance bro entitlement, lazy boy syndrome or what some preposterously claim to be the slow and incomplete maturation of our male brains.We professors are encouraged to swing AI-positive in these changing times. “Consider how AI and humans can work together to create content,” our Center for Learning and Innovation counsels. Wise words, and I have much to learn. But I do want students to get some practice writing the old-fashioned way on their own. Even in these new times, this remains a world of words, maybe more than ever between the texts, emails, reports, applications and posts by the gigabyte. You’ll do better if you’ve put in some work to hone your writing skills untethered from the digital master.Nor is writing just any skill, like making duck decoys or patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time. “Language is the mother, not the handmaiden, of thought,” wrote the great mid-20th century poet W.H. Auden. “Words will tell you things you never thought or felt before.” For me, putting words to page is how I think something through, sometimes arriving at quite different conclusions from where I started. You find out what of your ideas hold up and what don’t when tasked with the daunting job of filling the blank page with something that rings true to yourself.Spotting AI fakery isn’t very hard, especially when you’ve waded through as many thousands of essays as I have. That pseudo-thoughtful voice grates with its “furthermores” and “howevers” in what tends to mediocre pasteurized parody of a college essay. Some of my students employ ChatGPT to turn their draft into a finished essay, which bleaches out errors as well as individuality into bright white AI empty word carbs. Others paste their machine-generated summaries of readings between passages of their own writing — or, heck yeah Flounder, make that platform earn its monthly subscription by doing the whole paper.I get grumpy sometimes about the AI-ing. I like cool new technology, but I don’t want machines doing everything for us like WALL-E’s catering robots. Machining your paper isn’t fair to the students who put in the time to do their own work. My professorial ego is mildly offended that students have ignored my request that they write in their own words, not to mention thinking I’m too stupid to notice their AI drivel. And then there's the pesky matter of plagiarism violating our sacred honor code.I still have a hard time getting too indignant. Many of my AI-ers will disarmingly admit to their transgressions when I ask them to a chat in my office. They proffer all manner of excuses real and invented, but I seldom have the appetite to fulfill my threats about lowering grades, except sometimes for the most egregious repeat offenders. The small matters of war, poverty and a melting planet matter more to me than whether a nineteen year-old does a lazy crap job in their classes.I recall my cheating history. I’m lousy at science, but I took another physics class to fulfill a college requirement. The professor was a funny and brilliant hippie, and I liked putting in the hours to learn theorems and their applications by contrast to my skulking high school cheating. Sometimes those horse-and-buggy paper, pencil and gray matter practices of learning could even be fun, just like our kindergarten teacher told us.But that was then and this is shiny, high-tech now. I love it that the majority of my students still do like to dive into the messy work of reading, thinking and coming up with views of their own. I’m not ready to join the AI-positive crowd, but next year I may try something new like in-class exercises or requiring draft histories to get all my students writing. Playing policeman stinks, and soon the codes will likely be good enough to cover their own tracks anyway. As we plug into high-tech devices, data streams and platformed networks, it’s harder than ever to draw the line between human and machine, virtual and real — or to be sure it exists any longer. You can’t stop technology and the floodwaters of time, although I’m not so sure that this strange world is heading anywhere good.Someday maybe you’ll just plug a college education QChip into your cortex instead of spending four years on campus.You’d save a lot of tuition that way.Orin Starn is a professor of cultural anthropology and history."
Calle de change: Why the honeymoon stage of study abroad matters,Valentina Garbelotto,2025-02-26T22:00:00Z,Feb,26,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/calle-de-change-20250226.html,"Twenty-seven days, eight hours and a few minutes. That’s how long I am into my 19-week study abroad program in Madrid, and I’m still firmly planted in the honeymoon stage. Despite the relentless rain that has shrouded the city in gray, I find myself falling deeply in love with it. Why? Because people air-kiss to greet you, there’s a supermarket full of undiscovered treasure on every corner and my new favorite bar serves gummy bears with sangria — a combination I never knew I needed. Yet beneath the glow of novelty and excitement, I realize this experience is more than just creating a transitory home for myself; it’s about discovering new rhythms, habits and maybe even a new version of myself. Every small detail of daily life here is a revelation, a quiet lesson in how to live differently.When I first accepted my place in Duke’s Madrid program, I was introduced to the standard graphic showing how emotions might unfold during study abroad. It starts with the excitement of arriving in a new country, figuring out how to arrive to your homestay and the beginning of the honeymoon stage. Then comes the realization that you’re still the same person with the same issues, even if you’re 5,000 miles away from home; followed by adjusting just as your time abroad is ending and, eventually, reverse culture shock.After a 12-hour flight from Buenos Aires to Madrid via Air Europa, I go from sweltering 90-degree heat to the crisp chill of the mid-20s. Immigration’s a breeze, and my suitcases arrive even faster, but I have no clue where to find a taxi, and at 5 a.m. Madrid time (1 a.m. in Buenos Aires), I want nothing more than a bed. Stepping outside, I find 40 taxis lined up, all eerily empty, like a scene from a macabre cyberpunk dystopia. After walking up and down the road trying to locate a chauffeur, one finally catches my eye, and I gladly drag my two overpacked suitcases toward him. Exhausted and sleepless, I’m finally headed toward my homestay — my home for the next five months.Now, a few weeks into my time in Madrid, I’m still floating in the euphoric feeling of being abroad. I’m enchanted by the late-night tapas, the moonlight on cobblestone streets, and the novelty of everyday life in a new city. Yet, beneath the Instagram-worthy moments, I’m navigating the quieter, more personal work of finding my rhythm in an unfamiliar place. Before Madrid, my days were dictated by efficiency. At Duke, my life revolved around a tight schedule: back-to-back classes, a few jobs, a never-ending to-do list, meals eaten in ten minutes and the constant rush from one commitment to another. I measured my days by how many tasks I could squeeze in before collapsing into bed. Madrid, however, doesn’t rush. It lingers, stretches and embraces pauses. It’s teaching me to do the same.Even so, as I slow down, I wonder if I’m just viewing the world through rose-colored glasses, stuck in the dopey-eyed honeymoon stage, before homesickness and the inevitable frustrations of cultural adjustment take hold. This period is often revered and feared — in love, travel, or moving abroad. But is it something we should be chasing, or is it just another phase that inevitably fades?The enchantment of the honeymoon stage doesn’t entirely erase the underlying uncertainty. It lingers in the background, whispering questions: How do I move from being a wide-eyed tourist to someone who truly belongs here, even temporarily? Who will I grow closest to in this new chapter of my life? What pieces of Madrid will stay with me long after I leave? And the biggest question of all — who am I becoming in the process?And so, my journey begins, and the first shift is the simple act of walking everywhere. In a city designed for pedestrians, the metro and my own two feet have become my primary modes of transportation. What once felt like an errand — getting from point A to point B — is now an experience in itself. I take in the golden glow of the buildings at sunset, the laughter spilling out of cafés and the way metro musicians turn the most mundane commute into a mini-concert. Walking here isn’t just about movement; it’s about being present. My hour-long train and metro commute to classes at the University Carlos III of Madrid lets me stand still in time. I can escape into a fictional world with my Kindle, ponder where my fellow travelers are headed and create backstories for every conversation I have the pleasure of overhearing.Then there are the late dinners — an adjustment I’d never been able to make back home in Argentina, but have found myself falling into seamlessly here. Dinners at Duke were often squeezed between study sessions or club meetings, more out of necessity than enjoyment. Here, it’s a ritual. Eating at 9 or 10 p.m. no longer feels absurd; it feels right. The table has become a space for conversation, connection, and slowing down. My homestay mom, who has hosted students for over 25 years, effortlessly fills my silence. Whether recapping her day out on the town, discussing the latest opera she’s been to, or showing me photos of her nephews, she’s teaching me that food isn’t just about sustenance — it’s about bonding. She is a reminder that while places shape us, it’s the people who truly leave their mark.While the honeymoon stage of studying abroad is often dismissed as a temporary infatuation — a blink in time before reality sets in — I’m starting to think it’s worth more than we give it credit for. We cling to its magic for a reason, because we fear the inevitable unknown. But maybe, instead of resisting its transient nature, we should embrace it for what it is: a rare period where we are most open to discovery. When everything is unfamiliar enough to make us question our default settings — the habits, assumptions and beliefs we never thought twice about before. And maybe that’s the point.The wonder and curiosity that have swept over me in these first few weeks of falling for Madrid have made it effortless to shed my anxieties and embrace each new experience wholeheartedly. These weeks have allowed me to reassess the habits I’ve clung to — questioning which still serve me in this fresh chapter and which are ready to be left behind. This stage is the essential first step in transforming an unfamiliar place into home. It isn’t just about being swept up in the beauty of a new place, but about rethinking how we live, who we are and how we want to devote our time. It’s a time to reevaluate our routines and create new ones, rather than falling into what we’ve become accustomed to. This isn’t just a shallow, wide-eyed phase — it’s the foundation for everything that comes next. Without the honeymoon stage, our conscious adjustments would never get the chance to become second nature. Right now, my friends and I still rely on Google Maps to get around. But I know that, in a few weeks, we won’t have to think about whether to turn left or right to get home — we’ll just know. In the same way, I hope this slower, more intentional way of living won’t just be a phase but something I carry with me long after I leave Madrid. And so, I’m savoring the honeymoon stage — not as an illusion, but as a beginning. I know that no matter what wave of emotions comes next, I’m stepping into them stronger than before.If you told me a month ago that I’d be perfectly content wandering aimlessly down side streets, lingering over a two-hour meal, or showing up somewhere without a meticulously planned agenda, I wouldn’t have believed you. But Madrid is changing me. And I’m learning to let it.Valentina Garbelotto is a Trinity junior. Her column, “Dear comfort zone: It’s not me, it’s you.

On taking up space,Annie Ming Kowalik,2025-02-26T11:00:00Z,Feb,26,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/on-taking-up-space-20250226.html,"“If only I were a woman,” lamented a close male friend of mine — someone whose engineering talent and dedication to supporting others I deeply admire — “then I'd have access to an extra 60k of scholarships.”It wasn’t the first time I’d heard this sentiment, and it unfortunately won’t be the last. Given enough time and with enough honesty, most of my male peers have expressed some version of this belief. Yet, what’s most striking is that this perspective persists even at Duke — a university whose ratio of female students in engineering is more than twice the global industry average. Despite the visible presence of women in classrooms and labs, the misconception that diversity programs offer an unfair advantage remains firmly rooted. At my home university, the University of New South Wales (UNSW), where non-cis-male students make up only roughly 22% of the engineering cohort, the gender imbalance is more obvious. This contrast lays bare the systemic reasons behind underrepresentation — factors that go far beyond individual choice. From childhood, gender determines the path that children are steered down. For example, often unintentionally, elementary school teachers will hold biases that reinforce the belief that boys have greater natural ability in mathematics and other math-intensive disciplines. Parents, too, play a role: It may be stereotypical, but nearly all of my female friends have memories of ballet class at age 6, while most of my male peers grew up playing video games and with computers, but not necessarily vice versa.Over time, these seemingly small influences compound, creating a gap that grows wider with age. Compared to boys, girls have fewer opportunities to participate in informal STEM activities, such as competitions, camps and science museum visits. Boys also receive more parental explanations during shared scientific activities, which enhances their STEM self-efficacy. This reduced technical encouragement leads to many girls internalizing the belief that they are less capable. Research shows that women consistently underestimate their abilities, even when their performance matches or exceeds that of their male counterparts.I know this from experience. In high school, after traveling all the way from Australia to compete at the FIRST Robotics World Championships, I stood in Houston Airport in tears — sobbing for three hours, convinced that I wasn’t good enough to pursue engineering. This was ridiculous, considering why I was at the airport in the first place. But I was so firmly convinced of my incompetence that I had applied to university earlier that year to a degree I wasn’t particularly passionate about. It took my robotics mentors staging an intervention — sitting me down and refuting every single one of my objections, refusing to let me believe I wasn’t capable — to shake that doubt. Their fierce belief in my ability became a turning point. Without their unwavering encouragement, I might have chosen a non-technical path, not because I lacked skill or passion for STEM, but because imposter syndrome had convinced me I wasn’t smart enough. And I’m not alone. My female peers and I often have conversations where we question whether we’re good enough for the classes that we take. Yet, we push through those moments of doubt — not because we inherently believe we belong, but because we refuse to bow to the pressure of a society that still questions our place in STEM. Our persistence is an act of defiance — a refusal to let centuries of exclusion define our futures. We persist because we know that every step we take forward, regardless of whether we stumbled getting there, makes it easier for the next generation to see themselves where we now stand.This is precisely why diversity programs are necessary. They are not about offering unearned advantages — they are about correcting a playing field skewed by centuries of bias. The current efforts to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives reflect the same harmful thinking that fuels the misconceptions my peers express, insisting that if only they were of another race or gender, they would gain more opportunities or support. It’s the same flawed logic that blames foreigners for stealing a job, rather than recognizing that the true culprit is a capitalist system designed to exploit the cheapest labor available — which often happens to be that of an immigrant. Diversity programs aim to dismantle these structures, creating a more just and inclusive society.We need to shift our mindset. It is imperative that we do the extra work to understand the structures of power that we don’t personally experience the brunt of. Dangerous thoughts don’t start as fully formed ideologies—they begin small. They start with the belief that your privilege is a disadvantage and that the only way to succeed is to deny others a step up. They take root in college classrooms, where they become internalized if left unchallenged. By recognizing and calling out this insidious mindset, we take a crucial step toward dismantling the barriers that hold us all back. True progress comes not from competition against one another, but from building a world where everyone has the support and opportunity to reach their full potential.I admit I’m not the most naturally brilliant engineer. But when I put my mind to it, I really am quite good. And that persistence is more than personal — it’s a statement that women belong in STEM. We don’t persist because of special treatment; we persist because we are capable, determined and deserving. Every step forward is proof that we belong, and every barrier broken is a testament to those who fought before us and those who will follow in our footsteps.Annie Ming Kowalik is a Pratt sophomore and a visiting international student from the University of New South Wales.Her pieces typically run on alternate Wednesdays."
On becoming children (even if for a day),Shambhavi Sinha,2025-02-25T11:00:00Z,Feb,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/on-becoming-children-20250225.html,"The mundanity of daily living at Duke binds us to its walls: There seems to be little to no variation. You wake up in your dorm. You eat at WU. You study at Perkins. You go back to sleep. The cycle repeats. There exist some parameters that perturb this equilibrium, from game days to Friday night-outs, and yet they occur often enough that they bring with them a far more agonizing feeling of the mundane. Life is a recurring cycle. The time period of this cycle is simultaneously the fastest and the slowest thing we can ever experience. A minute can feel like hours, yet years can feel like seconds. And it shows. Some days in my mind, not a single minute has passed since I was 17: walking the streets of India, dreaming of the origin of stars and staring at hornbills. But, I am not 17: and have not been 17 for some time now. Today, I walk the 10-minute walk from Rubenstein back to Crowell, staring at Orion as I do daily, and ponder metric spaces. And yet, when it snowed for the first time in a 1000 days, I felt like I was dreaming again. I remember FDOC, and talking to a friend (who then, was probably an amicable stranger, as we all were, and will become) who mentioned their immense sadness for the rarity of snow in Durham. I consoled her (and myself) by saying that if it snows once about every four years, surely we will see it once before graduating, right? Though I said these words, I couldn’t even bring myself to believe them. Coming from India, the accuracy of a meteorological report for a given day was basically equivalent to blindly throwing a dart on a board meters away after spinning around 30 times. That is, extremely low. So my faith in my own extremely unfound claim was even lower. Color me surprised, when I find myself witnessing not only one, but three snow days this semester. Of course, it was not the first time in my life I had seen snow. And such was the case for many others. But it did not matter; for we were all in this moment together, witnessing the spirals created by individual snowflakes falling. And for those who had witnessed this chilly embrace for the first time, I’m sure the moment was far more magical than my words can encompass. Eventually, the novelty wears off. You stop fawning over the way the windows of Rubenstein reflect light upon its entrance, or marvel at the colored sunsets on your way back from Wilson. You stop asking your friends what they’re doing at every breathing moment. You stop going through the Blue Book excitedly, trying to imagine your future at this school. You’re in this moment. And sunlight will pour in again, the sun will set once more, friends will eventually meet, and you will go through classes semester after semester until it ends. In the same vein, the snow will continue swirling around for a couple of hours, classes will be canceled, and we will become indifferent. Right?Not really. The third snow day of the semester was the most special. And part of the reason why it was so special to me, is that the novelty wore off. And yet, childlike joy and giggles echoed across campus. And I could feel the warmth of the many ways we embrace the weather, and each other. My roommate and I enjoyed the silent wonder of the swirling snow from our windows, as I finished Dazai’s “Blue Bamboo”, and she worked on her multiplexers. Upon leaving the warmth of my cozy room came with a warning: make haste, lest you are confronted with a snowball to your face! Fair play, and so I ran chuckling at the merrymaking ensuing near the Clocktower. Only after I descended, did I note a fantastic sight: a group playing volleyball as the wind settled snowflakes on our lashes. I can only but applaud their indomitable spirit, and it has now become possibly the single best exemplar for whenever I introduce Duke as “lighthearted, sporty”. Shared headphone cords and beanies staring out of the windows near Cafe, with hands curled around vanilla lattes. Green woolen turtlenecks, and horn-rimmed glasses, leaning on the pillars in Vondy with a book in hand. Plaid wool skirts, dewy hair and black puffer coats, making snowmen with light-up devil horns. Shimmering snowflakes refract the light of the street lamps as they fall. Miniature snow people and snow ducks line the benches of WU. Cardboard sleds. Laundry basket sleds. Snow sliding from the pine trees. Frozen ponds. And these little moments compound. For me, an escape from the mundane is experiencing this. For in these moments, Duke students become children again. In a world constantly burning (from willful ignorance to active maleficence), there are enough stressors. For a student population that wants to change the world (hopefully for the better), these circumstances feel no less than being Atlas, carrying the burden of the present and the future. So, if nature gives us the grace, a chance to live Ferris Bueller’s Day Off: embrace the cold. Let the snow fall in your eyes as you walk. Let your hands go red as you prepare that snowball. Let yourself lie down and stare at the stars as you accelerate down the Garden’s slopes.

Pearson, Tim'm West, Lee Levingston Perine, Ace Robinson, Jillian Johnson",2025-02-25T11:00:00Z,Feb,25,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/call-on-duke-from-black-queer-alums-20250225.html,"We are a collective of Black queer alums who were highly active while students in supporting the intersectional experiences of historically disadvantaged students and continue now as alums. We stand unapologetically and fervently in full support of our fellow intersex, transgender and gender-diverse students, faculty, staff and alums. Across the United States, gender-diverse people are having their entire existence legislated, mitigated and even eliminated. In his first couple of weeks in office, the sitting president has signed a series of executive orders, provisions of which included enforcing the government to only recognize two sexes, banning transgender people from the military, banning trans women from women’s sports and restricting gender-affirming care, among others.The challenges faced by gender-diverse individuals are compounded by societal stigma and systemic hatred inflamed by our current political environment. Western history reminds us that the Nazi party’s assaults on transgender people began by demonizing them as immoral and sexual predators, restricting their access to public accommodation, forcing detransitioning and then finally placing them in concentration camps. Fifteen years ago, repeating these grave horrors of the Holocaust seemed to be unheard of within the U.S. That is no longer the case.Attacks on gender-diverse people are especially felt in the halls of higher education. Transgender and other gender minorities have been used as political fodder throughout academic institutions stoking fear and hatred which has left so many people feeling unsupported, depressed and despondent that no one has their back.We call on the University to aggressively and openly support gender-diverse individuals who are routinely experiencing the worst levels of prejudice and discrimination from denial of public accommodation, restrictions on extracurricular activities, physical and emotional abuse from family, friends and/or strangers and public discourse demonizing them for simply existing in North Carolina and across the U.S.We recognize the invaluable contributions that these populations bring to Duke, our region and the world, and it is imperative at this junction in American history that our university affirms the humanity of each and every person — regardless of gender identity or sex. It is our collective responsibility to challenge current injustices and foster an atmosphere where every person, regardless of gender identity, can thrive. Duke must be a place where all gender-diverse members feel seen, heard and supported in their personal, academic and professional journeys.A public statement from University leadership calling out the baseless and reckless laws to harm and demean a particular minority group would be the first, yet arguably most important step, to uplifting the humanity and intrinsic value of all gender minorities. An open commitment to supporting gender-diverse individuals is an indispensable component to making them feel that the institution they are part of truly has their back. Throughout our time at Duke as both students and alums, we have advocated for a more just Duke society that uplifts the unique qualities in all of us. Duke must commit itself to realizing a campus environment that actively supports the wellbeing of sex and gender minorities, especially when it may encounter potential pressure — political or otherwise — to do the opposite. This includes maintaining access to public accommodation including housing, healthcare services to affirm their humanity, implementing policies that protect against discrimination and creating safer spaces for individuals to express their true selves without fear of prejudice or marginalization.As transgender and gender diverse people face increasing attacks by the Trump administration and beyond, we call on Duke’s leadership to be a national leader that speaks up and sets the standard for fairness and dignity of all. This also requires continually striving for stronger protections, policies and resources that reflect the needs and rights of all those in danger of being erased in the U.S. and beyond. By unapologetically supporting sex and gender minorities, we unleash the power of our gender-diverse community to contribute to society without being held back by discrimination. Compassion must be our norm.There is never a reason to delay a response to injustice. Tacit complicity will not save us.Silence = Death.- Ace Robinson, Trinity '00 (he/him)- Hon.

The quiet power of today,Samantha George,2025-02-24T11:00:00Z,Feb,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/quiet-power-today-20250224.html,"“Everyday is all there is.”- Joan DidionI’m doing that thing again. The minutes are quickly turning into days, the days into weeks and the weeks to months. I’m spending more time looking at my calendar than actually doing the things on it. I’m forecasting, I’m estimating, I’m falling into living in the future, and it doesn’t take a genius to wonder why I’m a little unhappy. The draggings of February towards March seem to be especially plagued by this forward-thinking. As we all begin to anticipate the end of the semester, looking towards summer jobs and internships, thinking about what classes we are going to take next year, where we’re going to live or what our post-grad plans will be, it’s easy to get caught up in thinking too far ahead. Especially this year, with a few bouts of snow and many days of grey-weathered rain, I’ve found myself particularly inclined to look ahead and count down till sunnier, spring weather arrives. As much as I enjoy the view of snow flurrying to the ground, I’m tired of scarves and jackets and icy sidewalks.I find myself getting lost in the immensity of my days, too. At the ripe age of 21, I’ve lived approximately 7,815 days, give or take, with each one filling its own 24-hour block, whether I like it or not. I often consider how these days take shape, how stringing three or four together in such a way leads to a project being completed or a book being read, a period of great friendship and love or a stretch of grief and loss. Sometimes I can anticipate this stringing and can see how the next week will be marked by studying for a certain exam or excitement for an upcoming holiday. But, other times, it is only in hindsight that I am able to see how certain weeks or months came to be marked by a specific emotion, person or event. With any thinking of the future, we cast away a piece of our present. We put a smidge more value in what could be over what is, sacrificing our current world in exchange for hoping towards a future one. But being able to think about moments beyond the present doesn’t mean you can experience more than one at a time. Didion’s words are a powerful reminder that this day, today, is all there is. Because when you wake up tomorrow, boom: there today is again. I find myself thinking of this quote often when considering time in big clumps — when I say that I study everyday, or go to the gym or have to make breakfast. “Ugh, I do this everyday,” I say to myself, to my roommate or to my mom over the phone. But Didion’s words offer the chance for us to step back and realize that this “everyday” is what truly makes up our lives. It encourages us to not let our everyday blur into a clump, but to be seen as the foundation of our lives. If my everyday routine is what makes up the majority of my life, is it not the thing in which I should be most invested? Didion’s words can seem bleak, addressing the monotony of our lives. They can be read downwardly, in defeat: “everyday is all there is …”. But I find them empowering, as a subtle YOLO of sorts, exclaiming “everyday is all there is!”, a call to immediate action. They illustrate how the greatest control we have over our lives comes from putting energy into our everyday routine, rather than master planning our futures. They encourage us to reassociate our laments about what we do “everyday” and be more intentional about how we shape our days. To be a little more present when we talk to that friend, or to take the extra moment to cook our daily breakfast to perfection or to step a little lighter on our daily walk to campus. Didion’s point of view urges us to incorporate pieces of joy into our lives now, to make our everyday's that much sweeter, rather than relying on special occasions to make our lives remarkable.So, minding all your future plans and aspirations, I quietly remind you that what you do each day is as important as what you plan to do tomorrow. While our reflections on our current days will inevitably become blurs of trends of highs and lows, I urge you to consider the days individually as we live them. We can think in strings or clumps, or look back and find patterns, but, in the moment, we can only be here, and no matter how our minds stretch it, each day is the same 24-hour block marching forward and forward. And how your days walk, their sway and style, is up to you, everyday. And that’s all there is to it.Samantha George is a Trinity junior. Her column typically runs on alternate Mondays. "
Duke selected as the first college for a Bachelor franchise spin-off: ‘The Baccalaureatte’,Monday Monday,2025-02-24T11:00:00Z,Feb,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-first-college-bachelor-spinoff-20250224.html,"Editor's note: The article below is satire.After discovering that a past Duke student is currently on season 29 of ABC’s The Bachelor, the show’s viewership has increased around campus by 9%. Noting this peak in interest, a Duke alumnus who works at ABC negotiated that Duke University be the first school to be part of “The Baccalaureatte.” This spin-off is only open to undergrads. The first season will follow the format of “The Bachelorette,” where one lucky Duke female will select a husband out of the 25 male contestants.Duke professors have been tasked with choosing the 25 guys for the show. A few key traits for selection include whether they have a 6-pack, a chiseled jawline and if they're emotionally unstable enough to keep ratings high. Kindness and philanthropy will significantly lower contestants’ chances of being selected. With a slightly more targeted approach to encourage higher student campus engagement, Duke will select its female Baccalaureatte based on who most frequently completes dining and housing surveys.Duke plans to have their own version of “The Bachelor” mansion. Various places were considered, including the Swift Apartment. However, that idea was scrapped when the producers realized the spotty bus schedule could interrupt filming. Ultimately, the decision was made to kick the University’s president out of his house for six weeks of filming. Not to worry, though; the president was given a plush single in the Craven dormitory with a beautiful view of the outdoor courtyard below. As is customary in The Bachelor franchise, there will be group dates and one-on-ones. The series proposal outlined a few potential date ideas. Group dates range from flunches with professors at McDonald’s to doing Kilgo dorm inspections after students move out for the summer. One-on-ones will include activities such as throwing the first pitch at the Duke youth baseball camp’s final game or intimate reveals as they wait for their mobile order to be ready from the dining hall.A significant change will be in each episode’s “rose ceremony,” where our Baccalaureatte chooses which contestants stay in the competition to win her heart. Instead of giving roses, she will provide answer keys for some of the university’s most notoriously difficult tests. The revised rose ceremony stems from a partnership with the physics department, which is trying to boost department involvement after losing half their majors to grade deflation. Sadly, she will not be able to meet everyone’s families in person, as the “hometowns” will be over Zoom due to all of the budget paying for the first pitch contract. The show’s much-anticipated fantasy suites will happen in each finalist’s freshman dorm. This might lead to strategic eliminations from the Baccalaureatte to avoid hookups in Bassett.Finally, after picking her winner, the couple will be handed a paper with all of the unofficial graduation requirements to complete together. The show executives plan to contact the Duke contestant from The Bachelor’s season 29 to host. If she declines the offer, a representative from Duke’s Wellness Center will host so they can monitor potential STD outbreaks more closely and hand out protection during fantasy suites.Monday Monday would like to inform the estimated hundreds of viewers that it will air on Tuesday mornings at 3:30 a.m. on ABC.

Mother (Nature) knows best,Anna Garziera,2025-02-23T11:00:00Z,Feb,23,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/mother-nature-knows-best-20250223.html,"I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but the grass on the main quad is getting soggy again. Poor thing, it’s gone through a lot. This winter has been particularly dry. When it rains, the soil quickly becomes oversaturated. The water sits in misshapen puddles on the lawn. Yellow and irritated from prolonged thirst, the grass finds itself drowned with every sudden downpour.Recently, it has also endured a bench burning — and it shows. Black marks streak the few shreds of grass that were left after a herd of excited students trampled the lawn when Duke beat UNC at the home game on Feb. 1. Lots of fun — but the lawns are a mess. Either I’m psychic or I’ve just started noticing patterns, but I can feel the “Lawn Restoration in Process” signs coming. College decision deadlines are fast approaching, and Duke will want to comb its hair and straighten its bow-tie before welcoming potential Dukies to campus. For us students, it’s sort of an annoying process. When the ropes are stretched so as to enclose the lawn, we can no longer cut through the grass to speedily get to our next class (because God knows that the tiled pathway is never the optimal path). Pythagoras is shaking his head — but I could even live with having to go around the various bends. What’s really frustrating is witnessing Duke’s wasting time, money and resources as they “restore” their beloved bright-green winning lawns over and over. As opinion writer Shambhavi Sinha pointed out earlier this year, every “restored” lawn at Duke looks the same — unoriginally perfect. Nauseatingly so: “The lawns I once loved, now made me feel sick: Because what I loved was never real,” she wrote.Yet the to-be-restored lawns are somehow worse. Brown, stagnant. It looks like they’re being force-fed dirty water and can’t quite get it down.In fact, these prefabricated strips of lawn have a multitude of problems: The soil is not porous enough and the single slim-blade grass variety is not well adapted to the North Carolina climate. Most importantly, covering large stretches of land with only one species of grass is highly unnatural. One variety of grass doesn’t make up a self-sustaining ecosystem. Instead, low-lying plants are only a first step towards an eco-friendly habitat. This is not revolutionary thinking. Environmental scientists have known this for years. No single organism can or wants to live in solitude. Even in less biodiverse environments, species help each other out in unexpected ways. But not on Duke’s lawns. Our grass has to make it all on its own.I’ll stop personifying our grass soon, I promise — but give me just a second longer. Duke’s lawns are irrigated several times a day. They are fertilized often. They are even “aerated” thoroughly once in a while. And the grass still dies.Perhaps, that’s because those utopian carpets of perfect lawn laid out every couple of months here at Duke aren’t what the Earth really needs.But you know what doesn’t die easily? The wild grass and weeds that grow in the few neglected patches of dirt on campus.Hear that? Neglect is great for nature, if we’re the ones doing it. Clovers, dandelions and buckhorn plantains pop up all over campus, defying Duke landscapers’ weeders, sometimes even finding a home among their dead comrade — the once-perfect sod. And within them thrive bugs and other little creatures, who now find the soil no longer drowned in fertilizer but consistently rich with nutrients.It’s really quite a beautiful image, that of our campus nature thriving — and one that lots of us at The Chronicle feel strongly about. But I didn’t start this rant just to talk about grass. That discussion is not an end in itself. Nor did I prod this hot topic to criticize Duke — I’m sure they have a good reason to keep reordering replacement lawns. Even if that reason is just that perfect lawns sell, I’d understand. We are a private institution, after all. Instead, I’d like us to notice why the unnatural, bright green lawn keeps dying time and time again. Its environment is plain and bleak. Its prospects are poor. We can’t let the same happen to us. Thankfully, we’ve seen colleges desegregate and club teams become coed. We’ve seen a push for more balanced diets that include all food groups. Our curriculum embraces a variety of classes — there are enough majors, sports clubs and opportunities to give us a tummy ache.As students, we have some agency. We can’t choose which species of grass to have on our campus lawns, but we can choose who to hang out with and what classes to take. We can choose what to have for lunch and where to eat it. We can cultivate our experiences and sow all kinds of seeds in our gardens.And these small choices have big consequences in the aggregate. The more we diversify our environment, the more ideas we’re exposed to, the more sustainably and successfully we can advance our personal goals. If you’ve been having lunch at the same gloomy table in the corner of WU all winter, try having lunch outside on BC plaza and see what it does to you.Small choices can seem inconsequential to our lives as a whole — but that’s not the case. It’s just difficult to see their effect from up close. We should step back more often and make sure the canvas of our lives is sufficiently colorful. Variety is almost always a good idea. And even if Duke doesn’t make that choice for its poor lawns, we can make it for ourselves in other aspects of our lives — and thus thrive. Anna Garziera is a Trinity sophomore.

Home is where the bull is,Shruthi Narayanan,2025-02-21T11:00:00Z,Feb,21,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/home-is-where-bull-is-20250221.html,"Shooters II. It’s sweaty. It’s sometimes dead. The music doesn’t always hit. But it certainly feels like home. “This is us. This is you guys,” Kim Cates, the owner of Shooters II, tells me with pride during our interview in a dimly lit bar booth. It's a bar meant for Duke students, and she intends to keep it that way. Her eyes light up as she speaks about the students who've made this place their second home over the years. Even through the challenges of the pandemic, the bar has remained a constant in student life, adapting but never losing its essence. Someone once told me that humans carry some sort of “ordinary magic.” We do these insane things for people we love, and it's second nature. The more we love, the more wizardry we take part in. It's in the small gestures, the quiet moments of care that often go unnoticed but mean everything. I see this magic in Kim's heart when she leaves my interview a handful of times to answer her team's questions, apologizing each time but unable to ignore their needs. I see it in the Shooters buses she arranges to campus on nights she knows will be busy, ensuring all her kids get home safe. These aren't just business decisions — they're acts of love disguised as logistics. The scary part of college for so many of us is that we are no longer home. Laundry doesn't get magically done and the only person who cares if you had dinner is you. The independence we crave as teenagers suddenly feels heavy when we realize what we've left behind. This feeling crept up on me in the fall of my first year when I got “The Cold.” A cold that would remain my most constant companion, weathering the fall, winter and spring with me. A cold that polluted the ECON 101 lecture hall with echoes of coughs. I woke up on a Wednesday morning, just in time for my COMPSCI 101 midterm, with nostrils clogged and the driest of throats. At that moment, the distance from home felt infinite. There was no one to, unprompted, heat up a bowl of soup and start me a warm shower. These small comforts of home became precious memories rather than daily realities. It's in these moments of vulnerability that we realize how much we need others — not just for the big things, but for the small gestures that make us feel cared for. Perhaps that's why Shooters feels different. To Kim, it's about creating a space where she meets wonderful people and where these wonderful people meet each other. Her eyes soften as she explains how she was shy as a girl. Hard to imagine the owner of Duke's favorite bar as a shy person, isn't it? However, she explains how the students have helped her become a more confident person. “These kids make me feel special,” she says, quickly correcting herself, “and I hate to say kids, but the students make me feel special.” The transformation in her voice is palpable — from uncertainty to assured warmth. Like chicken soup for a cold, sometimes the medicine we need most is simply being seen and cared for by others. That's the beauty of it all. For all those biology majors out there, it's a symbiotic relationship. That's how the best ones are. Kim gives us a home, and we give her purpose. She looks out for us, and we help her grow. Life gets more colorful when you have someone looking out for you, and somehow, it gets even more radiant when you have someone to look out for. It's a cycle of care that grows stronger with each rotation, each late night, each moment of connection. The way I see it, that's what we all seek: someone else. Someone who peers over their shoulders to see if you are doing ok. Kim embodies this perfectly: “I see somebody up here to the side that don't look like they're happy or they're crying. I want to find out what's going on. Can I help you with it? You know, it's important to me.” Her words carry the weight of countless nights spent watching over her student family. Kim runs Shooters the way I think we should all approach relationships: with intentionality, gratitude and love. “I will fight for the Duke students,” she declares, and you can hear the fierce protection in her voice — the same tone my mother uses when speaking about her children. It's a familiar sound, one that echoes across generations of caregivers. In an ultra-sappy way, I find the utmost comfort in this: how, as a species, what we love most is each other. I often say it doesn't matter if there are 30 people or 300 in Shooters; as long as my best friends are breaking a sweat on the dance floor, it's a successful night. It's the instant connection you feel when you run into someone you’ve never met and scream the lyrics of “Love Story” to each other. The magic isn't in the crowd — it's in the connections. Sometimes, it takes us leaving our childhood homes to understand how special it is to be unconditionally cared for. Now that we know, I implore you to find people to care for. Build your own networks of ordinary magic, one small act of kindness at a time. At home, it's my mom, and in the corner booth of Shooters II, it's Kim Cates. Different spaces, same love.

"Paper promises, priceless losses: The closure of Duke’s herbarium",Jakob Hagedorn,2025-02-21T11:00:00Z,Feb,21,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/paper-promises-priceless-losses-20250221.html,"Duke will likely NOT be carbon neutral in 2025. As outlined in this recent article, Duke achieved carbon neutrality in 2024 by relying heavily on purchasing carbon credits — costing $4 million and covering two-thirds of its emissions — to offset its footprint. These credits cannot be reused, and Duke has already bought more than initially planned due to renewable energy project delays.The wording on Duke’s sustainability commitments website has received subtle changes: An April 2024 capture of the page finds that “Duke University … set the goal to become climate neutral by2024,” whereas a current version, from February 2025, has been updated to say “climate neutral in2024.” One of these implies an ongoing continuation of neutrality, while the other is finite. This is a small but significant difference. Duke’s shifting rhetoric on climate action isn’t just a matter of minor semantics — it reflects a deeper pattern of institutional decisions that seem at odds with its stated environmental commitments. The university’s approach to sustainability appears increasingly disingenuous, prioritizing its image — such as meeting climate goals through purchasing credits — over substantive, long-term investment. Nowhere is this more apparent than in its decision to shut down the Duke Herbarium.The herbarium is one of the largest private university collections in the country and has been a critical resource for climate research, biodiversity studies and ecological preservation. Yet despite its scientific significance and potential for continued use in climate-related studies, Duke administrators decided to close it — without consulting faculty or considering alternative funding options. The justification? Maintaining the herbarium would require $25 million.However, this figure could be disputed. The administration argues that this amount would be necessary to fund the location and staff costs, with the yearly returns from an additional $25 million investment into Duke’s $11.9 billion endowment covering ongoing expenses. Yet, in its 104-year history, the herbarium has never required an independent endowment, and there is no clear reason why this standard should now be imposed. According to Kathleen Pryer, professor of biology and the director of the Duke Herbarium since 2005, the actual yearly cost could consist of two staff salaries plus additional faculty positions that may exist regardless of the herbarium’s operation.The administration argues that it is not worth bearing these costs, as the herbarium only provides minor research services in proportion to its space requirements. Susan Alberts, Robert F. Durden distinguished professor of biology and dean of natural sciences, who announced the closure of the Duke herbarium in an email to the faculty one year ago, said that out of the 2,000 papers published by Duke faculty, 23 included the keyword “herbarium”. Deciding to close a 104-year-old institution based on a keyword search seems overly simplistic and flawed. Like a herbarium, a library provides foundational resources supporting research in countless ways, even if scholars don't necessarily mention “library” in their work.On a closer look, the herbarium delivers valuable research, especially related to climate and biodiversity science. One project uses plant species like ferns and pine trees to monitor lithium contamination — an emerging public health issue linked to battery and solar panel production. By analyzing these plants, researchers aim to map lithium toxicity across North Carolina, showcasing the herbarium’s unique contributions to environmental science.Furthermore, the herbarium plays a crucial role in fostering new research, including engaging young researchers. For instance, a local high school student collaborated on a Duke study examining how the flowering time of the pink lady’s slipper has changed over the last 150 years. The research revealed that the flower now blooms 12 to 17 days earlier, providing valuable insights into the effects of the climate crisis on plant life. This kind of hands-on research offers emerging scientists a unique opportunity to contribute to ongoing biodiversity studies.The relevance of the herbarium extends beyond the field of botany. For example, Andrew Griebeler, assistant professor of art, art history and visual studies, utilizes the herbarium’s resources in his research — studying botanical illustration and providing students with valuable learning experiences and materials for research projects. During his time as a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton — whose herbarium was shut down in the 1970s — such resources and expertise were no longer available there, limiting opportunities for interdisciplinary research.One argument put forth by Duke’s administration is that digitalization can serve as a substitute for maintaining a physical collection. While high-resolution imaging and DNA sequencing have indeed revolutionized research, they cannot fully replace the herbarium itself. According to Pryer, only half of Duke’s collection has yet to be digitized, meaning that if the physical specimens are dispersed or lost, a significant part of its scientific value could vanish. Furthermore, as Griebeler’s research demonstrated, the herbarium is more than just a repository of plant specimens — it is also a hub of expertise. The knowledge tied to these collections is irreplaceable; without the herbarium, Duke risks losing not only its plant specimens but also the generations of specialized knowledge that have been cultivated alongside them.A recent PNAS paper explicitly describes this process, stating that “the loss of collections infrastructure and expertise also represents the loss of crucial opportunities for training and specimen-based education.” For Duke, which heavily relies on its reputation, the closure of the herbarium is a very public contradiction of its own stated goals. Even after massive outrage from experts and researchers in prominent publications and over 20,000 signatures on a petition, Duke’s administration remains steadfast in its decision to close the herbarium. In January, the Herbarium Working Group conducted three interviews with potential institutions — the North Carolina Botanical Garden, the New York Botanical Garden, and the Fort Worth Botanic Garden — in an effort to find a new home for the collection. Notably, the University of Florida has already withdrawn from discussions, citing insurmountable space constraints that preclude accommodating Duke’s large collection.The loss of herbarium collections is more than just a financial decision; it is a direct blow to climate science at a time when current political agendas threaten environmental policies. Research conducted using herbarium specimens has provided concrete evidence of changing global temperatures and their impact on plant life. Without these collections, our capacity to model future ecological trends and design effective conservation strategies would be significantly diminished.Like its reliance on carbon offsets rather than real emissions reductions, Duke’s closure of the herbarium signals a troubling trend of focusing on sustainability commitments that look good on paper but crumble under financial scrutiny. The contradiction is clear: While the university touts its dedication to tackling climate change, it is simultaneously discarding an irreplaceable tool for studying its effects.Jakob Hagedorn is a visiting international student from Berlin, Germany. Editor's note: A previous version of this article stated “Duke will NOT be climate-neutral in 2025.” The sentence was adjusted to state “Duke will likely NOT be carbon neutral in 2025.” This is to acknowledge that the University has not publicly stated whether it plans to maintain carbon neutrality in 2025 and that Duke had a carbon neutrality commitment, rather than a climate neutrality commitment, in 2024."
Duke’s administration should speak publicly about the University’s vital interests,"Timur Kuran, John Aldrich, Michael Munger",2025-02-20T11:00:00Z,Feb,20,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-should-speak-publicly-about-vital-interests-20250220.html,"The Trump Administration’s cost-cutting measures threaten Duke and other U.S. colleges and universities. Duke leaders are obviously grappling with the implications for research programs and other activities. We write to encourage them to speak out publicly in defense of Duke’s mission, explaining how the announced policies would harm programs that serve the national interest.Several months ago, Duke Faculty for Institutional Neutrality and Free Speech circulated a petition urging the University to adopt a position of “neutrality” with respect to political developments that do not affect its operation directly. We are among the 140 signatories of that petition. Universities that adhere to institutional neutrality — and there are many — commit to not taking positions on political, social or economic issues of no direct relevance to their core activities. Their students, faculty and staff, including administrators, remain free to speak publicly on any controversial matter, but only as individuals. But exercising institutional neutrality in the sense promoted by Duke Faculty for Institutional Neutrality and Free Speech imposes no obligation to remain neutral on government policies directly related to the University’s own mission. President Trump’s unfolding policies linked to the Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), when fully implemented, will cause severe harm to Duke and every other university that receives federal research grants. For that reason, the Duke administration has every right, even if it wishes to abide by institutional neutrality, to point out the harms imposed by DOGE policies.The announced cut to the allowable indirect cost rate on NIH grants (for research universities, a drop from up to 65% to 15%) will cost higher education many billions of dollars; it would devastate cutting-edge research programs. Likewise, the ongoing dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will drastically shrink research programs dealing with such issues as economic development and global public health. There are also efforts to raise the 1.4% tax rate on university endowments, which apply to universities with more than 500 students and have endowments valued at $500,000 per student or more. With its $12 billion endowment, Duke will see its operating budget shrink if its net endowment income falls. Not a day goes by without viral social media posts on wasteful, silly or ideological projects that should not have been funded. Though the grants in question are unrepresentative of federal grants to universities, the differences may be lost to the average citizen, whose trust in universities had fallen to historic lows even before the Trump Administration took office. To allow such posts to shape public opinion will make a dire situation even worse. Hence, there is an acute need for universities to educate the public on the national benefits of federal research grants, the rationale for indirect costs rates higher than 15 percent and the justification for taxing university endowments at a special rate.Like other universities, over the past decade Duke has taken public positions on matters that did not directly affect its mission. This was unwise, we think; non-neutrality harmed our reputation, and it undermined our ability to teach and do research effectively. But now we face a situation requiring Duke and other universities to take clear positions on matters central to their core activities. We urge our administration and the leaders of other universities to defend our vital interests publicly.John Aldrich is the Pfizer, Inc./Edmund T.

What’s up with protests at Duke?,Adam Levin,2025-02-19T11:00:00Z,Feb,19,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/whats-up-with-protests-duke-20250219.html,"In the past year, protests have erupted at top schools nationwide. Presidents of schools like Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were paraded in front of Congress, all of them interrogated in an attempt for lawmakers to show just how much they hated antisemitism. Even our neighboring school, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, experienced encampments, frequent demonstrations and high media attention. Yet Duke seemed to avoid the brunt of student activism. Duke students have yet to organize an encampment on campus. Only about 30 out of the 7,000 students in attendance during Jerry Seinfeld’s controversial commencement speech last spring walked out. The recent vigil for Gaza on BC Plaza only maintained 10 tents and even received ridicule on student-driven social media apps. However, the lack of demonstrations doesn’t only apply to pro-Palestinian advocacy: Duke’s student body, despite being generally politically engaged, has a shocking lack of student activism relative to peer institutions. While almost 90% of Duke community members planned to vote in the 2024 election — and most nonvoters were non-citizens — after the election, a certain amount of political apathy has sprung up. Why is Duke so immune to the nationwide trend of protests? What is unique about the Blue Devils’ campus and culture that seems to discourage students from activism? Duke’s career-driven focus, exacerbated by a clear administrative priority to limit disruption, significantly limits student-led protests. As almost any Duke student knows, corporate culture exists within every facet of the university — whether it’s the business fraternities like Scale and Coin, the overwhelming focus on summer internships or the funneling of students to “profitable” fields like economics or computer science. However, Duke’s omnipresent pre-professional culture disincentivizes students from meaningful activism. According to Inside Higher Ed, “nearly 30 percent of students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses say they have had a job offer rescinded in the last six months, and two-thirds believe that it likely had to do with their activism.” The risk of losing a professional opportunity is too significant for many students; in one of my Political Science seminars, we discussed how even ardently pro-Palestine students aren’t willing to give up job opportunities for a social cause. As a side note, this feeling might not be completely accurate. Only 14% of employers said they were “very” or “extremely” concerned about protests on college campuses and nearly 80% of employers have no plan to change hiring decisions due to increased unrest. However, this truth may not entirely matter: If the prevailing feeling is that any rock-the-boat activism will jeopardize your future career, why risk it? Beyond fear, the corporate culture means students focus more on the money-making mindset than on making the world better. When your focus is on the next summer internship, the new connection you’re making at your second coffee chat this week or which pharmaceutical benefit manager stock to present to Investment Club, activism inevitably hits the backburner. One of my favorite conversations this year involved a self-described anarcho-communist in one of Duke’s business fraternities. When I asked about the apparent contradiction, she shrugged and admitted, “I’m a sellout.”The influence of corporate culture isn’t a problem unique to Duke: in the Harvard Crimson, one student, taking a cue from Adam Smith, largely rejected the pursuit of “build[ing] value for society” by arguing that “be[ing] greedy” is all it takes to improve the world. However, it’s especially prevalent here, where a whopping 30% of students enter finance, business or consulting management after graduation. At this point in the article, I’ll momentarily get off my high horse and acknowledge how easy it is for me to say this. My family pays full tuition for Duke. I’m a legacy. I don’t have outsized pressure to develop a generational wealth that never existed before. Historically, an Economic Journal paper found that lower-income individuals are less likely to participate in social activism: Is it fair for me to judge someone who just wants to achieve financial security for themselves or their family? That question would exist at any university. However, the other part of that equation is Duke’s relatively high proportion of ultra-rich students, even among Ivy Plus colleges — almost 20% of Duke’s population comes from the top 1%. About as many students are from the top 0.1% as the bottom 20%. The same Economic Journal study found that wealthy individuals are just as unlikely to participate in social movements. These students tend to be more conservative and apathetic about political change — understandably, it’s easier to trust the system when you grow up affluent. Duke’s administration further exacerbates this political apathy. As of October, the new picketing rules require that student groups register protests three weeks in advance. Under those bylaws, if, I don’t know, the U.S. was to send migrant flights to Guantanamo Bay or a North Carolina judicial candidate was suing to throw out 65,000 North Carolina votes, Duke students would have to wait 21 days before having any organized student response. The irony of this approach lies in how much pride Duke takes in its historical student activism. Pictures of civil rights era campus protests hang proudly in Perkins, and searching “student activism” on any Duke website yields a proud memorial of events such as the Allen Building Takeover (1969). As recently as 2016, eight student activists occupied the same building to protest Duke’s unethical labor practices. Even though this protest forced Duke officials to relocate 35 classes for a week, the students faced no legal or disciplinary penalties. Yet I can’t imagine an event like that would exist within Duke’s current “pickets, protests, or demonstrations” guidelines, which ban any sort of “disruptive or disorderly conduct.”None of this is to say that Duke doesn’t have protests. Recently, members of the emerging Duke Sunrise Movement chapter unfurled a massive banner over Abele Quad protesting the rise of fascism. But these are few and far between and have yet to experience significant student support. For Duke to again realize its full potential for student activism, it will require a supportive administration and a motivated student body. Even with the unique limitations of Duke’s organizing culture, that second change is entirely within our control. Over the weekend, I attended a political organizing conference in Washington, D.C., where one student shared that her campus Democrats club was one of the largest organizations on her campus. Regardless of your personal political views, it’s almost mind-boggling to think that a non-business club could crack the top five. It starts with your friends — encourage them to attend protests, social advocacy events or even just educate themselves on a political cause. If not, we will continue a self-reinforcing cycle where a politically apathetic corporate culture breeds politically apathetic corporate students. Adam Levin is a Trinity first-year.

Tradition as an antidote to campus polarization,Sherman Criner,2025-02-18T11:00:00Z,Feb,18,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/tradition-antidote-campus-polarization-20250218.html,"Like the rest of America, Duke is starved of common ground. At first glance, Duke appears to be a university deeply committed to civility, bridging divides and fostering meaningful dialogue across political and ideological spectrums. One might assume that these commitments have translated into a campus culture where students and faculty engage openly and productively across partisan lines. Indeed, the university has taken admirable steps in this direction. Within the past year alone, Duke has launched the Provost’s Initiative on Free Inquiry, Pluralism, and Belonging, reviving the once-defunct Civil Discourse Project and invited figures like former Republican Senator Richard Burr to discuss “Bridging Divides.”Yet, for all these commendable initiatives, has the campus political climate truly shifted? Apart from a few isolated developments like the recent Polis Election Roundtable, have students really started embracing civil discourse? Has there been an “aha!” moment where we link together, conservative and liberal, and look forward to a brighter, more prosperous America? The answer to these questions remains a resounding no for many of us.This breakdown in discourse is not unique to Duke — it is a broader symptom of a society that has lost touch with its shared traditions. Political debates often turn into clashes of competing realities, where neither side recognizes the legitimacy of the other’s worldview. Consider debates on American history, where one group references “The 1619 Project,” emphasizing the nation’s origins in slavery — asserting, as Nikole Hannah-Jones writes, that “anti-black racism runs in the very DNA of this country” — while another cites “The 1776 Report,” which counters that “the Declaration’s unqualified proclamation of human equality flatly contradicted the existence of human bondage.” These irreconcilable starting points hinder meaningful conversation as students engage in debates armed with fundamentally different perceptions of reality.This challenge is not new. Edmund Burke, the 18th-century statesman and philosopher, warned of the dangers of severing ourselves from tradition. His insights offer a crucial lesson for our present moment. For Burke, tradition was not mere nostalgia for the past but the accumulated wisdom of generations — an inheritance that enabled societies to evolve without descending into chaos. As he put it, “we procure reverence to our civil institutions on the principle upon which nature teaches us to revere individual men: on account of their age and on account of those from whom they are descended.”In other words, societies ought to defer to their traditions and institutions because they embody the organic development of norms, values and wisdom that have withstood the test of time. This does not mean we must blindly accept tradition for tradition’s sake. Rather, we must ask G.K. Chesterton’s famous question: Why was it put there in the first place?Burke’s insight is particularly relevant to Duke. Without a shared civic tradition, we lack the common historical and political reference points necessary for meaningful engagement. Instead, our political conversations often devolve into battlegrounds of conflicting narratives, each side rejecting the legitimacy of the other’s worldview before retreating to the safety of affirmation hubs. A baseline of ideas must be established so that students can understand the values that inform both the systems they seek to reform and their peers’ most deeply held beliefs. This baseline must apply universally, not selectively, based on one’s perceived social power, class status or historical discrimination. True dialogue is impossible if some students are exempted from engaging with opposing worldviews while others are not.If Duke’s administration is serious about fostering civil discourse, it must recognize — or at the very least, entertain — the enduring wisdom of Burke’s message: A common tradition is the key to social cohesion. As Burke argued, “We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason; we suspect that this stock in each man is small.” Without shared intellectual traditions, individuals risk being guided primarily by abstract notions of ideal moral conduct rather than the concrete, historical and philosophical traditions forged through the generations. True civil discourse is not accomplished through sporadic speaker events or abstract commitments to pluralism, but through a structured and shared civic education that provides all students with a common intellectual foundation from which to engage in meaningful debate.Establishing a mandatory American civics curriculum could provide the intellectual foundation necessary for informed democratic participation. Students would develop a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the nation’s complexities by engaging directly with foundational texts of political philosophy and grappling with competing historiographical narratives. Civic education should not be an exercise in passive absorption or ideological reinforcement but a rigorous exploration of the tensions, contradictions and aspirations that have shaped — and continue to shape — the American experiment. To ensure this, the curriculum must embrace the full breadth of America’s intellectual and political traditions, both historical and contemporary. If students are to read something like “The 1619 Project,” they should also engage with “The 1776 Report” — not to present a false equivalence, but to critically examine how historical narratives are constructed and contested. But the course must not stop at modern debates. Students should be required to wrestle with defining, and often contradictory, works in American history, including “The Federalist Papers,” Alexis de Tocqueville’s “Democracy in America,” David Walker’s “Appeal,” and John C. Calhoun’s “Slavery: A Positive Good.” These texts provide a raw, unvarnished view of the debates that have shaped American foreign and domestic policy for centuries, challenging students to engage with them on their own terms.Of course, implementing such a curriculum is not without controversy. Some may argue that including texts like John C. Calhoun’s “Slavery: A Positive Good” risks legitimizing morally indefensible positions. But education is not about sheltering students from harmful ideas — it is about exposing those ideas, dismantling them with reason and evidence and ensuring that students understand why they were defeated in history’s great moral struggles. The best antidote to bad arguments is not silence but a well-trained mind that can dismantle them at their very roots. Far from stifling discourse, this approach cultivates the habits of rigorous analysis and informed debate, ensuring that students are not just inheritors of democracy but active participants in its ongoing project.To that end, civic education must be more than just reading texts — it must be an active, dynamic process. Structured debates, faculty-moderated workshops and peer-led discussions would ensure that no perspective is presented as absolute but rather tested through intellectual rigor. Assignments could require students to defend positions they disagree with, forcing them to engage seriously with opposing viewpoints rather than dismissing them outright. This is not about imposing a singular patriotic vision — it is about ensuring that every Duke graduate leaves with the intellectual tools to navigate civic life thoughtfully.Critics may argue that mandating such a course infringes on academic freedom, imposes an artificial consensus or raises concerns about who controls the curriculum. However, Duke already requires students to take courses in “Interpreting Institutions, Justice, & Power.” The key difference is that this proposed civics requirement would guide students through the American story and its competing narratives together, giving everyone a common foundation for debate rather than allowing them to fulfill this requirement through courses that may reinforce existing ideological silos. If we truly value understanding how power and justice shape our institutions, we should provide students with the shared intellectual framework needed to analyze these forces meaningfully.Admittedly, trust in civic education can be fragile, especially in a polarized society where Americans increasingly inhabit separate realities. But the solution to these ills is not to sidestep them — it is to confront them directly. Too often, students fear that engaging with opposing perspectives will lead to personal invalidation as if even acknowledging a different worldview is a concession of defeat. But what, truly, is the danger in discourse? What harm comes from sitting across from your political opposite and testing your convictions against theirs? And if, in your eyes, justice demands change, how can you create meaningful progress without first understanding those who stand in your way?The real threat, therefore, is not discussion — it is disengagement. When we refuse to engage, we don’t just avoid discomfort, but we surrender the very possibility of persuasion, understanding and finding common ground.This is not just an abstract ideal — it is already being tested at other institutions. Just down the road, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has recently implemented a course — “Foundations of Civic Life and Leadership” — as part of its IDEAs in Action General Education curriculum. Though not mandatory, this course introduces students to the big questions surrounding civic life through classic politics, philosophy and literature texts. It examines the role of the state in society, the balance between individual freedom and government authority, the founding principles of American democracy, and contemporary civic controversies. By blending theoretical foundations with historical case studies and modern debates, UNC has created a model that Duke would be wise to follow. If UNC can take this first step, there is no reason Duke cannot lead this endeavor into the future. True civil discourse demands more than intermittent “fireside chats” featuring heterodox speakers — it requires reviving the shared intellectual and historical foundations that once anchored higher education. In today’s culture of repudiation, the question is not whether Duke can do this, but whether it has the courage to begin.Sherman Criner is a Trinity junior.

HUMBLE,Luke A. Powery,2025-02-17T11:00:00Z,Feb,17,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/humble-kendrick-lamar-20250217.html,"During the halftime show at this year’s Super Bowl, the hip hop artist Kendrick Lamar performed a piece from his 2018 Pulitzer Prize-winning album, “DAMN.” It was called “HUMBLE.” and at one time it was a number one hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Whether you liked his Super Bowl performance or not, there is a lot of wisdom in humility. The refrain of the song is:“Tell 'em, be humble (hol' up)Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil')Be humble (hol' up)Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil')Tell 'em sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil' hol' up)Be humble (hol' up)Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)”“Down” is the operative word in the song. Even though so many of us want to be upwardly mobile, “down” moves us closer to the ground, which is where we are from as humans. The words “human” and “humble” are linked to the Latin word “humus” or earth; the humble person has his or her feet down on the ground. This posture acknowledges that we humans are “of the earth.”Although humility is our very texture as humans, it ironically doesn’t come naturally. Some can get caught up in bragging about their children with bumper stickers — “My child is an honor student at success academy.” But what about a sticker that says, “My child learned humility at school this month?”To be humbled, sometimes we need to eat humble pie. “Humble pie” has interesting linguistic roots. In the fourteenth century, “the numbles” were the name given to the heart, liver and entrails of animals, especially of deer. By the fifteenth century, this word “numbles” had become “umbles.” Umbles were used as an ingredient in pies, and the first record of “umble pie” in print is as late as the seventeenth century. “Humble” means “of lowly rank” or “having a low estimate of oneself,” and umble pies were known to be eaten by those in a humble situation (i.e. the poor); thus, we get “humble pie.” To “sit down” in humility, as Lamar says, does not mean to be cowardly or insignificant. One of the great liberators in ancient biblical times Moses “was very humble, more so than anyone else on the face of the earth” (Numbers 12:3). Even the prophet-priest Ezekiel, a mortal, understood that there are things we’ll never understand no matter how many years we study for a law or medicine degree. He embraces a humble position of incomprehensibility when he answers a question God asks him with this response back to God: “You know” (Ezekiel 27:3). Ezekiel was humble enough to recognize he didn’t have all the answers.There’s so much wisdom in humility. The ancient Jewish text Tosefta Sanhedrin teaches that, “When you turn proud, remember that a flea preceded you in the order of Divine Creation.” This is one more reason we should be humble. Even after his epic novel “Roots”was published in 1976, Alex Haley said that in his office he had a picture of a turtle sitting on a fence post. It reminded him of a lesson taught to him by his friend John Gaines: “If you see a turtle on top of a fence post, you know he had some help.” And so Haley said, “Anytime I start thinking, ‘Wow, isn’t this marvelous what I’ve done!’ I look at that picture and remember how this turtle — me — got up on that post.” Lamar has put the title of his song in capital letters to grab our attention for a critical message: stay humble, stay grounded, regardless of your success. “Sit down” and remember that fleas got here before we did. “Be humble” and reflect on how we are all like turtles on a fence post. Have the humility to recognize that we have received help to be where we are today.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel. His column runs on alternate Mondays."
‘The revolution’: Trump and the changing landscape of political activism,Aria Dwoskin,2025-02-16T11:00:00Z,Feb,16,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/the-revolution-trump-political-activism-20250216.html,"“The revolution ‘bout to be televised. You picked the right time but the wrong guy.”Kendrick Lamar’s words during the Super Bowl halftime show echoed through televisions in households across the country last weekend. On one of the nation’s largest-viewed stages, Lamar’s performance was rich with political symbolism, calling out the racism and division in America. Lamar’s performance was framed by narration from Samuel L. Jackson dressed as Uncle Sam, the personification and embodiment of America. Uncle Sam introduces the halftime show as “the great American game,” but following Lamar’s first performance, he interrupts:“No no no no no! Too loud, too reckless, too ghetto”As Lamar continues his performance, Uncle Sam is only satisfied when slower, less rap-centric songs are played, as he explains:“That’s what America wants. Nice and calm.” Finally, Lamar responds with more than just music, stating,“It’s a cultural divide. Imma get it on the flow. Forty acres and a mule, this is bigger than the music.”This dialogue between a Black rapper and Uncle Sam is used as a mechanism to expose America’s labeling of Black people as “reckless,” “loud” and “ghetto,” simultaneously forcing them to assimilate and be “calm.” Moreover, Lamar’s allusion to “forty acres and a mule” calls back to America’s unfulfilled promise to formerly enslaved people after the Civil War. This performance paints a picture of the discrimination, cultural assimilation, erasure, and mistreatment of African Americans throughout U.S. history and into the present. While this exploration of the halftime show only begins to uncover its political implications, the essence of this “revolution” speaks volumes about what is to come in America. This show was more than just a dialogue on the ill state of our country, though. To fully understand this performance, we must acknowledge that President Donald J. Trump was in the audience. Trump has historically perpetuated racial prejudice, and recently issued an executive order which dismantled diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the federal government. To add to this, the NFL replaced their end zone sign “End Racism” with one that says “Choose Love” for the 2025 Super Bowl, seemingly a response to the discriminatory attitudes fueled by Trump. This undoubtedly contributed to Lamar’s outspokenness on Sunday, which is why he called it “the right time.” Trump’s dismissal of DEI only scratches the surface of the intense and plentiful executive orders issued since the start of his second term. Trump has always been a hardliner on a myriad of controversial issues. Upon inauguration, he declared that the government would only recognize two sexes; he signed an executive order banning transgender women from women’s sports. His administration has removed thousands of government web pages with resources on abortion access, HIV resources and LGBTQ+ health. Regarding climate change, Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement and blocked programs which helped minority communities reach environmental justice. These policies are not just bold — they are transformative and divisive, sending a ripple of lasting impacts across the country. However, another consequence of Trump’s leadership, often overlooked, is the surge in activism it ignites, increasing political engagement and general outspokenness. It is not just Trump’s policies that will shape the nation, but the voices — both empowering and harmful — that he fuels.His assertion that there are only two genders, and his barring of transgender athletes from their respective sports leagues, for example, will likely foster an environment that fuels hate toward transgender people. This mirrors a pattern seen during Trump’s first term, in which his presidency was directly correlated with an increase in hate crimes — ranging from racism to other forms of discrimination.But in response, it also encourages the agency of activists, uniting them to resist oppression. It is very likely that, amidst his transphobic declaration, powerful transgender voices will come together and advocate for increased rights. Further, take Trump’s initiatives attacking DEI: On one hand, this policy gives a platform for racism to take root and thrive. On the other hand, we see performances like Lamar’s halftime show, in which oppressive laws force powerful narratives to emerge. These trends will be interesting to examine in Duke’s generally passive political environment. Duke is often seen as a political vacuum, yet days after Trump took office, our campus saw a protest. This article is not meant to simply look at reactions to Trump in office. Rather, it is to acknowledge the voices that will be harnessed and the ways that they will shape our lives. When movements take form, both for the greater good and the bad, the climate of our environments shifts greatly. At Duke and across the country, it will be interesting to see the ways these affect our lives. Kendrick Lamar warned about “the revolution,” and it seems it is just beginning.

They love me ... they love me not,Shruthi Narayanan,2025-02-14T11:00:00Z,Feb,14,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/they-love-me-not-20250214.html,"The word ""crush"" is beautifully apt. CRUSH. Because that's precisely what a crush does — it demolishes and reconstructs our entire emotional landscape.This timeless sensation has been my lifelong companion. At 10, 15 and 19, amid hunger pangs and sleepy moments, crushes have been my constant — a universal language transcending borders and ages.In homage to love's delicate dance, I collected testimonies from my cherished friends (protected by whimsical fruit-based pseudonyms):Strawberry got smart, memorizing vocab to impress an intelligent crush. Pineapple faked baseball passion, posting Musical.ly videos outside the field. Apple tried setting up their crush with their best friend. Banana emailed a crush about joining his basketball team in middle school; she is still waiting for that response! Kiwi mapped running routes to pass a specific house. Blueberry spent $70 on a Pandora necklace for a girl, got Chex mix in return (and discovered his sexuality).We're willing to walk extra miles, take random classes, and spend unnecessary dollars — all for the possibility of love. Imagine what we'd do for the real thing.These stories reveal something profound: crushes are hope's most charming messenger. In a world of structured routines, they introduce delicious uncertainty.There is comfort in knowing, but there is magic in hope. And so I see crushes as a way that hope persists in our silly little lives. Amid memos, LeetCode, and recruiting, is that one face you kinda sorta hope to see. So here's to crushes: those beautiful chaos agents who make our hearts race and our lives interesting. They teach us that life isn't about having all the answers but about the thrilling moment of ""what if?""I think it's a noble job to be someone's crush. Suddenly, mornings aren’t as painful, and my outfits require at least 30 more minutes of calibration. Crushes become something people spend their entire lives seeking—purpose. I fondly remember all my silly conversations with my friends. The same giggles fill the air at 19 as they did at 11 when we whispered and swore secrecy over the name of some kid we saw in Math. So it's silly — the idea or the concept of a person being able to change the rhythm of your day and listen to songs differently. Let's take a moment to say THANK YOU to all those crushes that we’ve had, maybe still have, that remind us that we are still human. And that there is a live heart within us that, more than anything, yearns to find someone to beat for. As I sit here in Perkins, the ""Duke is For Lovers"" poster stares me dead in the eyes.

Leg up to legacies: Self-serving bias and the 'Forever Duke' generation,Kareena Sukhnanan,2025-02-13T11:00:00Z,Feb,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/leg-up-to-legacies-20250213.html,"Data shows that legacy applicants from 12 elite colleges, including Duke University, enjoy an extraordinary advantage, with a 37% acceptance rate at schools where they hold legacy status — nearly quadruple the rate for non-legacy applicants at the same institutions, which stands at just 9.5%. Even when legacy applicants apply to similarly prestigious schools where they lack legacy ties, their acceptance rate drops significantly to 11%, revealing how much their success depends on the legacy tag. Furthermore, legacy admissions disproportionately benefit the wealthiest applicants, as nearly two-thirds of legacy students come from families in the top 5% of income earners, with 36% from the top 1% alone. If universities like Duke claim to value diversity, innovation and fairness, they must question whether policies favoring legacy applicants align with these principles — or if they instead reinforce exclusivity at the expense of diverse, “holistic” admissions strategies. Legacy admissions further amplify economic disparities in student bodies, disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest applicants. As shown in the first figure in this article, the advantage for legacy applicants grows dramatically as family income increases. Legacy applicants in the top 0.1% are an astounding seven times as likely to be admitted as applicants with the same test scores. For reference, non-legacy students in the top 0.1% are two to three times as likely to be admitted. This disparity demonstrates the extent to which legacy preferences may elevate wealth over merit.Clarence Thomas, associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, describes legacy admissions as “poisoning” the admission process. The Supreme Court’s decision in Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) v. Harvard has also highlighted relevant opposition to legacy admission, as legacy admits tend to be wealthier and whiter than their non-legacy peers. This process is commonly critiqued for not being meritocratic. By granting an acceptance advantage to legacy students, Duke reinforces systemic inequities that contradict its core values of fairness and academic excellence.Legacy admissions may help maintain a familial “nature” to Duke, but it comes at the expense of merit-based admissions. Research done by Michael Hurwitz at Harvard indicates that legacy admissions often favor applicants who may be less qualified than their non-legacy counterparts. The study found that being a legacy applicant increases one's chances of admission substantially, even when controlling for other factors including high school GPA, extracurricular activities and rigor of high school coursework, proving that this boost given is not based on academics. The rationale for maintaining a low acceptance rate is to admit highly motivated and accomplished students. However, an inflated acceptance rate for legacy applicants suggests that familial ties may play an outsized role in an already even more “selective” admissions rate for non-legacy students, students with access to limited resources and those who face economic disparities. The consequences of a contrasting admission of legacy and non-legacy students at Duke can be understood through the psychological concept of self-serving bias. According to the American Psychological Association, self-serving bias is the tendency to interpret events in a way that assigns credit for success to oneself but denies one’s responsibility on external factors. Legacy preferences, benefiting from familial ties, may still attribute their acceptance to solely personal merit, while overlooking the systemic advantages their connections provide. This perception reinforces a sense of belonging rooted in tradition rather than individual achievement. In contrast, non-legacy students, who lack inherited advantages, may view their acceptance as a testament to their own hard work and qualifications. At Duke, perhaps this perspective can lead to a deeper appreciation for the opportunities Duke offers and foster a stronger sense of loyalty to the university. As a university, we should explore these psychological tendencies further to better understand how legacy admissions shape differing attitudes toward achievement and belonging within the Duke community.This practice prompts an important question: Are legacy preferences limiting access for the next generation of ""Forever Duke"" students who could better embody the University’s values of resilience, innovation and inclusivity? Ironically, Duke may risk weakening its community by admitting students who may have strong familial ties but lack the diverse perspectives, adaptability and merit-based achievements that enrich Duke’s dynamic and forward-thinking community.Ultimately, we must ask how a university that emphasizes diversity, inclusion and belonging — even embedding these ideals in its own admissions essay prompts — can continue to justify legacy admissions, which appear to contradict these principles.Kareena Sukhnanan is a Trinity junior.

The Department of Education may be on its way out. Is Duke prepared?,Leo Goldberg,2025-02-13T11:00:00Z,Feb,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/department-of-education-duke-prepared-20250213.html,"There has rarely been a period in American history during which the federal government has undergone such dramatic change in so short a time as the period in which we currently live. We are now roughly four weeks into the second Trump administration, and the consequent top-down shakeup of the federal government has been nothing short of nightmarish. Over the last month, Donald Trump has authorized his right-hand man, Elon Musk, to bulldoze his way through the federal government via his not-at-all-stupidly-named DOGE — or Department of Government Efficiency — purging any government agency that remotely stands in the way of their political agenda. The level of federal dismemberment that has taken place under the current administration, choreographed by the mercurial whims of an unelected billionaire, is truly unprecedented in American history. So far, this partisan witch hunt (ring a bell?) has included terminating thousands of federal employees across all sections of the US government whose fireable offenses range from promoting DEI initiatives to conducting investigations of Trump prior to his second assumption of office. The United States Agency for International Aid (USAID), whose work consisted of providing humanitarian assistance to 160 countries, was gutted this last week. So was the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), responsible for regulating financial products and services. Now, Trump and Musk are turning to their next target of federal downsizing: the Department of Education (DOE).Trump and Musk are currently moving to close the DOE, a government agency which the Republican party has increasingly accused of promoting “woke” ideology and inculcating liberal ideas in schoolchildren. Conservative politicians in America have long promised to shut down the Department of Education since its founding in 1979; however, the bureau has not faced such an existential threat as now. Abolishing the DOE would have substantial ramifications for schools across the US, but would be particularly disastrous for higher education and the provision of financial aid. The responsibilities of the DOE include but are not limited to: Overseeing federal student loan programs.Administering Pell grants that are vital for the ability of low-income students to attend universities.Delegating federal work-study programmes for college students, which provide a crucial source of income to assist with tuition costs. Millions of college students across the U.S., especially first-generation and low-income students, rely on this aid to be able to attend college. For Duke in particular, the severance of this federal-sponsored financial aid would potentially upend student life if the university is not prepared for this incoming loss of funds. Student loans, Pell grants and federal work-study are all DOE-delegated forms of financial assistance that enable a significant amount of the Duke student body to be able to attend the school. 51% of Duke undergraduates receive some form of financial aid, a substantial portion of which is federally provided and is imperative to fulfilling Duke’s guarantee to meet 100% of demonstrated undergraduate financial need. Duke students benefit from every type of DOE-administered aid. 22% of current first-year students are eligible to receive Pell grants, a figure which has doubled from the percentage of eligible first-years 2 years ago. Many students utilize Duke’s federal work-study program, which typically offers up to $2,200 in wages earnings to assist with tuition payments, 75% of which is covered by the federal government. The $5,000 loan that most Duke students receive in their aid offers is lent from the DOE.An impending shutdown of the Department of Education would likely imperil all of the above types of financial aid offerings for Duke students, and would put a stop plug in this incoming source of aid. The question now becomes: Who is going to compensate for this? Over the last couple of decades, we have seen a frustrating pattern of colleges footing the bill for expenses incurred onto students through tuition increases. If Duke incurs a massive loss of revenue resulting from a DOE shutdown, it’s possible that students will be looking at even greater increases in tuition to make up for it. If the DOE were to be abolished and Duke is not adequately prepared, it would portend an untold degree of harm for vast swathes of the Duke student body. Low-income students would have far fewer options for affording tuition given a drying up of grants and loans under a DOE shutdown, which are vital for allowing them to attend Duke. But middle-class students may be burdened most of all. While Duke may be unlikely to increase tuition for low-income students, it may do so for the middle class ones, who frequently get the worst of both worlds when it comes to paying for college, receiving less financial aid while being unable to fully pay for the exorbitant cost of attending Duke. An incoming severance of federal funds could also render further inequality among Duke’s student body if proper preparations are not taken. Duke already lags behind other sister institutions when it comes to socioeconomic diversity. A 2023 New York Times article found that Duke enrolls notably fewer low-income students than other prestigious universities, performing at a comparatively disappointing level. To give credit where credit is due, since the release of the article, Duke has taken steps to enroll more low-income students, such as the Initiative for Students from the Carolinas and the aforementioned doubling in Pell grant eligibility. But this hard-earned progress could soon be erased if the DOE goes under.Duke must take steps to prepare for a future without a DOE to ensure that its students are not forced to shoulder the financial burden of a federal fallout. We are extremely fortunate to have a wealth of resources and a bloated endowment of nearly $12 billion, and, therefore, there is no reason Duke students should suffer the consequences of Trump and Musk’s governmental malpractice. After all, what is the point of having such a large endowment if we don’t employ it in emergency situations like this? Duke, and institutions of higher education across the country for that matter, may soon face a critical juncture of defining their future of financial provision and proving if they are capable of being economically self-sufficient. The incoming threat from the Trump administration is looming, and preparatory arrangements must be made now. We are potentially staring down the barrel of a world of post-government-support for higher education, leaving students and universities to fend for themselves. And this extends beyond just financial aid. I haven’t even mentioned, for example, Trump’s recent moves to gut research funding, which would cause unknown harm to Duke and the research triangle.In the midst of this frightening uncertainty, Duke should be ready to stand firm in solidarity with its students and demonstrate that, in the face of adversity, it is willing and able to carry out the charge of providing education for which it is entrusted, and for which it is so well endowed. The future of our students, and institution, depends on it. Leo Goldberg is a Trinity first-year. His pieces typically run on alternate Mondays."
Do we trust others the way we want to be trusted?,Angarag Gantogoo,2025-02-12T11:00:00Z,Feb,12,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/trust-others-way-we-want-to-be-trusted-20250212.html,"Does being trustworthy make you better at trusting others? Or does it just make you more cautious because you know firsthand how easy it is to break trust? Maybe it depends on the context — after all, trust might work one way in an ideal world and another in the hyper-competitive reality of academia.It’s a question that lingers in the academic world more often than we’d like to admit. Picture this: you’re in a group project, and the professor has carefully curated a team of individuals who, in theory, should work together seamlessly. But in reality, one person does all the heavy lifting, another vanishes until the night before the deadline and the rest contribute just enough to have their names on the final submission. After enough experiences like this, trust stops being the default and becomes something others have to earn. And the irony? While you remain trustworthy, you become more skeptical of others.Academia is built on trust. We trust that our professors will grade fairly, that our peers won’t plagiarize and that when we collaborate, everyone will pull their weight. But reality doesn’t always work that way. Some students breeze through on others’ efforts, while those who are naturally dependable start questioning whether to take on the full load again or risk trusting their team. A meta-analysis published in the Journal of Applied Psychology examined the relationships between trust, trustworthiness and trust propensity. The study found that individuals who are more trustworthy tend to have higher expectations of others' trustworthiness. When these expectations are unmet, it can lead to decreased trust in future interactions.Then there’s the trust we place in professors. Unlike student relationships, where trust is fluid and renegotiable, trust in professors feels more rigid. We expect fair grading, constructive feedback and unbiased evaluations. But what happens when a vague rubric, an unexpectedly harsh critique or an inconsistent grading scale shakes that trust? Unlike with peers, there’s an authority dynamic — challenging a professor carries risks, while accepting an unfair grade can feel powerless.But trust, much like a well-structured research paper, is a two-way street. If you assume the worst in people, you might never give them the chance to prove you wrong. And if you trust too easily, you might find yourself doing all the citations while your classmates take credit for “teamwork.” So where’s the balance?Maybe trust is like a GPA — it’s earned over time, built on consistency and can be destroyed by one bad semester (or, in this case, one particularly disastrous group project). After enough disappointments, it’s tempting to assume that every academic partnership will end in betrayal. But here’s the thing about teamwork — sometimes, it actually works. And if we refuse to engage at all, we might miss out on those rare moments when collaboration is productive, even enjoyable. Maybe the key isn’t to blindly trust or completely withdraw, but to set boundaries—give people the chance to be reliable, but have a backup plan just in case.So, is trust directly tied to trustworthiness? In an ideal world, yes. In the academic world? It’s more of a negotiation. Trust isn’t just a fixed equation — it shifts based on context, past experiences and, let’s be honest, how much is at stake. But the way I see it, trusting others is always a risk, much like taking an advanced seminar when you’re not entirely sure you’re ready. Sometimes, you surprise yourself. Other times, you regret everything. But either way, you learn something.Angarag Gantogoo is a Trinity junior. Her column, ""Peopleology,"" typically runs on alternate Fridays."
Why I went back to therapy,Barbara Cardenas,2025-02-11T11:00:00Z,Feb,11,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/why-went-back-therapy-20250211.html,"Two and a half years ago, in the middle of my sophomore year, I hit my lowest low. I don’t mean that in a poetic, reflective way, I mean it in the most literal sense. I was barely sleeping, my appetite had disappeared and I was moving through my days on autopilot, hoping no one would notice how unwell I was. Eventually, after a nudge from a close friend back then, I did what I thought was my only option: I reached out to Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), Duke’s mental health resource for students.At the time, therapy felt like an emergency measure, like calling 911 when you’re bleeding out. I needed someone to help me function, to pull me out of the deep hole I had fallen into. I was embarrassed. But, to an extent, it worked. I started therapy, worked through what I could, and when I began to feel like myself again, I stopped. I told myself I didn’t need therapy anymore because I wasn’t actively drowning. That’s the purpose of therapy, right? You go when things are bad, and when everything is good, you move on.I was wrong.Fast forward to now, my senior year. By all measures, I’m at my highest high. I have an incredible support system, exciting opportunities ahead and a strong sense of who I am. I feel happy in a way I didn’t think was possible back then. And yet, for some reason, something in me said, “You should go back to therapy.” Or maybe that ""something"" was actually a friend from home who wouldn’t shut up about how therapy changed his life, and after hearing his 30-minute TED Talk on emotional growth, I started to wonder if he had a point.At first, I dismissed the thought. Why would I need therapy when things were finally going well? Wasn’t it selfish to take up space when someone else might need it more? But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that therapy isn’t just for crisis mode. It’s not just a fire extinguisher you break open when everything is up in flames. It’s maintenance. It’s checking in with yourself even when things are good. It’s making sure that the habits and patterns that helped you survive your worst moments don’t end up holding you back in your best ones.Here’s why I went back to therapy — and why you should consider it too:Therapy isn’t just for emergencies: It’s a common misconception that therapy is only for people in crisis. Research shows that therapy helps people develop better emotional regulation skills, improves relationships and even increases overall life satisfaction.Self-awareness is a lifelong process: Therapy isn’t about “fixing” yourself; it’s about understanding yourself. I realized that even though I was happy, I still had underlying fears, anxieties and thought patterns that could hold me back if I didn’t work on them. Therapy helped me uncover and navigate those thoughts.Your brain deserves a tune-up, just like your body does: Just like you wouldn’t wait until you’re physically sick to take care of your health, mental health should be proactive. Studiesshow that regular therapy can improve cognitive function, reduce stress and lower the risk of developing serious mental health conditions.You don’t have to do it alone: Even with the best support system, there’s something different about having a trained professional help you process things objectively. Friends and family are great, but they aren’t therapists. A therapist provides a space where it’s just about you — no judgments, no expectations, just understanding.Therapy makes good moments even better: The best thing I’ve learned since going back to therapy is that it’s not just about avoiding breakdowns — it’s about making sure you’re thriving. It’s about learning how to truly enjoy your happiness without fearing it will be taken away. Therapy teaches you to embrace your good moments and make the most of them.CAPS gave me a space where I could finally say things out loud that I had been keeping bottled up. My therapist wasn’t just a sounding board, she helped me untangle my thoughts, figure out why I was feeling the way I was, and actually do something about it. The process of getting started was easy, which was a relief because when you’re struggling, even sending an email can feel like climbing a mountain. And honestly, just knowing that there was a place at Duke where I could go, sit down, and be heard without judgment made all the difference.Going back to therapy has been one of the best decisions I’ve made. I’m learning to navigate success without fear and to embrace happiness without waiting for the other shoe to drop. I’m unlearning the idea that I need to be in distress to deserve help. And I wish I had understood that sooner.So, if you’re reading this and thinking, “I feel fine, I don’t need therapy,” I’d encourage you to reconsider. Therapy isn’t just for when you’re at rock bottom, it’s for making sure you don’t get there again. It’s for understanding yourself, growing and being proactive about your mental health. You don’t need a crisis to deserve support. You don’t need to justify taking care of yourself.I went back to therapy because I realized that my mental health deserves attention at every stage of my life, not just the hardest ones. And if you’ve been considering therapy (even if you feel okay!) I hope you give yourself that same grace. You deserve it.Barbara Cardenas is a Trinity senior.

The hottest thing this Valentine’s Day may be specificity,Samantha George,2025-02-10T11:00:00Z,Feb,10,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/hottest-thing-valentines-day-specificity-20250210.html,"“As a society we are embarrassed by love. We treat it as if it were an obscenity. We reluctantly admit to it. Even saying the word makes us stumble and blush… Love is the most important thing in our lives, a passion for which we would fight or die, and yet we’re reluctant to linger over its names.” - Diane AckermanWell folks, once again, Valentine’s Day is upon us. Whether you cast it aside as a commercial money-grab or happily don your pink hearted sweater, it’s impossible to avoid the notions of love that arrive on your doorstep every Feb. 14. Or, perhaps more accurately, Valentine’s Day just brings these notions closer to the forefront of our minds. But thoughts of love are really among us everyday, aren’t they? We live in a world that makes it nearly impossible to escape the obsession towards romantic love. Conversations of intimacy and relationships are all around us — in songs, movies and podcasts — and personal anecdotes of romantic pursuits often highlight daily debriefs and catch-ups. And why shouldn’t we be fascinated? Love is an incredibly powerful thing, further complicated by its unique meaning to each person. Anthropologist Helen Fisher famously spoke to the power of romantic love, explaining how it's akin to the rush of doing cocaine and how being in love is more of a drive, powering us to crave and want a person, rather than just a static emotion or state of being. In an iconic TedTalk, she explains how a person takes on a special meaning when you fall in love: that the world has a new center and the Earth a new axis on which it spins. Playwright Bernard Shaw put it similarly, albeit less poetically, describing love as a “gross exaggeration of the difference between one person and everybody else.”Considering the power, the immensity, of this drive to romantic love, it is no mystery as to why it’s such a focal point of our culture and a constant on our minds. Particularly as college students, young adults exploring real relationships for the first time, we may feel overcome by an urge to seek romantic love, to find our fix in the form of another person. And in our current digital age, the landscape for pursuing romance is only expanding. According to a 2023 Pew Research study, 53% of adults in the United States under the age of 30 have used a dating app and one in ten of these users reported meeting their long term partner online. Even here on campus, we bear witness to people outsourcing their desires for romance, in a flare of comedy, with the Duke and Fluke Marriage Pacts receiving thousands of submissions each year. Undoubtedly, thoughts of love surround us. This is certainly no question. Why then, with love’s pervasiveness in our culture, do Diane Ackerman’s words still ring with some truth? Sure, we throw “I love you’s” to our roommates as we head out the door and whisper it into phones to end conversations. We show love by remembering that friend’s coffee order when they’re having a bad day and by humoring our partner by playing their favorite game, even though we can’t stand it. And this love is meaningful and sincere. It’s real love. But how often do we articulate the depth, the specificity, of how we love? Why do our words often fall short compared to the immensity and power of the drive to love? Perhaps Ackerman is right — that to speak of love feels obscene or vulnerable. It feels like a faux paus to voice something so personal, so close to heart. But I push back on this idea, just a bit. At its core, as Fisher points out, love is a dynamic biochemical process that can bring us profound joy and fulfillment. Why should we be embarrassed by that? It’s universal, it’s natural, and it brings people together. Further, there’s truth in the notion that to feel an emotion at its depth and entirety we must be able to articulate it fully. Even in its Sisyphean nature, there is still great value in trying to articulate our love, to capture its shape and form to the best of our ability and to strengthen our connection and communication with others.So, this Valentine’s Day, I urge you to be specific in your love. Cast away the awkwardness, the vulnerability, the obscenity, and take the time to consider what words or actions fuel your drive to love. When you hand your friend their coffee, take the moment to slow down and explain how seeing them everyday offers you an instant mood boost. When you sigh and agree to one more game, swallow any awkwardness and tell your partner that you’d play ten more rounds of any game just to spend time with them. Don’t assume that your love goes without saying or is already understood. Strengthen your relationships by taking the time and intention to put what they mean to you into words. As you munch on chalky conversation hearts and red lollipops, use the holiday as an open door to practice the love you experience everyday, whatever form it may take. Boyfriend, girlfriend, partner, roommate, goldfish, or Fluke marriage pact, we can all be better players in the game of love by speaking it more clearly and intentionally.

Want not lack not,Anna Garziera,2025-02-09T11:00:00Z,Feb,9,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/want-not-lack-not-20250209.html,"I’m not ashamed to admit that I get most of my article ideas from class readings. It’s not deliberate: Just when I start to feel as though I have a fair understanding of the world, a professor will expose me to another pioneer’s work. And that never fails to rock my boat. I tend to find every new idea I’m exposed to mind blowing. Interestingly, I always have the feeling that these “discoveries” had already been brewing in my little grey cells. That’s to say, class readings put my thoughts — thoughts I barely knew I had — into words.I ran across a blog recently that said that Thoreau valued his time more than money. According to Rosemary Washington, “his definition of wealth is how much free time is left after his basic needs have been met.” This was old news for me. I’d already written about time being our most valuable asset.But something in Rosemary’s blog caught my eye. A quote from Thoreau’s “Walden,” which characterized a recent class reading — Sahlins’ chapter from “Stone Age Economics,” “The Original Affluent Society” — perfectly: “I make myself rich by making my wants few.”That Tuesday, I repeated this line to myself over and over. “I make myself rich by making my wants few.” It’s nothing I hadn’t heard before. The Minimalist movement has been preaching this for the past seventy years. In his novel, Sahlins argues that scarcity is a social construct. He holds that according to its definition, hunter-and-gatherer societies are more affluent than Western ones. They work only a few hours a day and have more than they need. To them, possessions are not a desire but a burden.In contrast, we work more than we’d like to. We consume abundantly yet remain unsatisfied. Imagine how liberating it would feel to walk into a close-to-empty home. The modern minimalism movement would agree: Even in our commodity-loving economy, there have been a few strong soldiers who resist the urge to overconsume. For a while, the trend of showing off one’s “underconsumption” even reached the younger corners of the internet. But that wasn’t Sahlins’ point at all. To hunter-and-gatherer societies, owning fewer things is not a challenge but a privilege. In a sense, it can be hard for us college students — especially us economics majors — to wrap our heads around this because we think of scarcity as it was sold to us in Econ 101. Unlimited wants - Limited resources = Scarcity. It’s fair to acknowledge that there are only so many reservoirs, oil wells and plots of land on Earth. In that sense, our collective resources are copious but limited. But who ever decided that there are unlimited wants?Certainly, left alone, humans don’t have “unlimited needs.” From nature’s perspective, that’d be unreasonable and unproductive. In fact, humans have very few needs — and they’re roughly the same for everybody: food, shelter, a feeling of security, and off we go. If we take what we have and subtract what we can live off of, we’ll realize that we are privileged to live in absurd luxury. The scarcity mindset we adopt is wholly constructed. That’s good news: We should be able to (and want to) free ourselves from its shackles.In a strange way, our wants are often a miscalculated way of fulfilling our needs. Think of the BMW sitting in your neighbor’s driveway or that Stanley Cup you might have asked for Christmas last year. Lots of what we consume isn’t meant to fulfill a functional need but instead serves to help us build status and “fit in.”But there are other ways of doing the same that don’t require us to consume excessively. Some have known this for years. In her blog ""Our Beautiful Adventure,"" Rachael claims that by living somewhere that takes her breath away, spending as much time as possible in nature and slowing down, she truly lives in abundance. We too can change our mindset and convince ourselves that we’re actually exceedingly rich.Growing up in a commodity economy, we start seeing prices as indications of what something is worth. But there’s a catch. The price might indicate how much the market values that good — but that doesn’t necessarily reflect how much we value it ourselves. Seeing everything as a commodity with a price tag attached to it makes us undervalue free things and overvalue expensive things. We actually have a very poor idea of how much things are “really” worth. For instance, a night on K-Ville in the snow might make us appreciate our modest dorm rooms more.Furthermore, growing up in a competitive economy makes us believe that as long as someone out there has more money, wealth, status than us, what we have is scarce. But again, scarcity only compares what you have with what you need. It has nothing to do with the wealth of those around us.And lastly, growing up in a material world has convinced us that consuming more is always better. We should maximize our consumption subject to our budget constraint. Yet if consuming more goods doesn’t make us happier, it only makes us poorer. We should know by now that the best things in life can’t be bought. And we should know by now that spending more doesn’t fulfill us. Yet thousands of packages flood student mailboxes and Amazon lockers daily. We just can’t get enough. And yet we have so much. Our lives here at Duke are so rich: friends to hang out with, events to attend, projects to tackle, material to learn and memories to make. It’s enough to fill a lifetime.While we’re still young and living “experimentally,” we should at least try stepping into the shoes of a nomad — to feel burdened by our material possessions. We should try to realize that this nagging feeling of scarcity has nothing to do with the stuff we own and everything to do with the relationships we build and maintain.Anna Garziera is a Trinity sophomore.

A plea to Duke’s administration: Will you stand for higher education?,Noor Nazir,2025-02-07T11:00:00Z,Feb,7,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/plea-to-duke-stand-for-higher-education-20250207.html,"Duke, you have a choice: Stay silent as federal attacks on higher education escalate, or take a stand in defense of your students and your core values.As of today, you have failed to stand up to federal pressure, avoiding actions that could make a real impact — such as barring ICE from the career fair on Jan. 30.The problem isn’t just that Trump is targeting universities, it’s that you’re doing nothing to stop it. I attended a Jan. 17 webinar where three university presidents, Patricia McGuire, Michael Gavin and Michael S. Roth, issued an ominous warning: The Trump administration threatened the students of universities in American democracy. After attending, I thought it important to shed light on university leaders you should take inspiration from. The Trump administration’s attacks on diversity and equity can be considered a deliberate effort to undermine universities and silence marginalized voices. While some university leaders are actively resisting, you continue to hide behind the curtain, rather than dealing with the administration’s actions head-on.Their hostility toward higher education isn’t new — but it’s escalating. From executive orders gutting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs to direct threats against academic freedom, this administration is actively working to dismantle your core values of diversity and inclusion. It won’t stop there.In light of this, does your silence protect your students? I wouldn’t think so — laying low is simply not a feasible path. Firstly, if you are a top 10 university, you are already on the map. Secondly, if you’re as big as 8600 acres, you can’t hide. Thirdly, whether or not you appear on Fox News, if Trump wants to pause your federal grants, he will —and if the courts stop him, there’s always the possibility that he’ll find another way. Ultimately, you won’t be safe in the next four years. Hiding won't save you.What truly protects your students? Letting an agency with a record of terrorizing immigrant communities recruit on campus — or standing with other universities to challenge this administration’s attacks? Note that dismantling DEI programs is the first step down a path toward broader anti-intellectualism.Vice President JD Vance said, “universities are the enemy,” and former President Richard Nixon said, “Professors are the enemy.” These statements reflect a broader fear of the transformative power of education, the very power that McGuire, Gavin and Roth are prepared to defend. They stand ready to protect the institutions offering higher education, including yours.This disregard for expertise isn’t just shaping university policy — it’s defining leadership at the highest levels of government. McGuire put it plainly, “How did we fall so far that it's possible for an entire administration to come in to have people who are so thoroughly uneducated, lacking in knowledge about the areas,” followed by a mention of Pete Hegseth’s nomination as Secretary of Defense as an example. Hegseth, a white man, was in the military for a few years and then was a Fox News host. The previous Secretary of Defense was Lloyd James Austin, a Black and highly decorated four-star general with decades of military experience. They don’t care about expertise, or education anymore. Our Cabinet nominations reflect that. Duke should’ve been ready the day Trump got elected into office; higher education has been under attack since Trump came into office in 2016. As Gavin noted, the previous Trump administration created a federal “playbook” that states have since followed, significantly impacting the sector. One major shift has been the heightened scrutiny of DEI, which Gavin highlighted as a critical area of contention. By targeting DEI programs, the administration is effectively dismantling initiatives designed to level the playing field for historically marginalized communities — particularly Black, Latino, Indigenous and other underrepresented groups (48% of your newest undergraduate class). Naturally, this racialized approach affects who has access to knowledge and perpetuates systemic inequities. Accepting these threats as the norm further endangers the systems designed to protect your students. Speaking out against these threats helps protect your students.History is on your side too. Higher education has been a breeding ground for activism. From the Civil Rights Movement, to the Vietnam War protests, to apartheid divestment campaigns, students have consistently forced change when institutions refused to act. Duke itself is no stranger to this history: The 1969 Allen Building Takeover is a documented, and now celebrated, example. Students have continually put their bodies on the line to remind universities of their responsibility to the public good — an effort that continues today. The 2016 sit-in against labor injustices. Black Lives Matter sit-ins. The protests to divest — from climate change, and the Gaza war. Yet, the university is standing idly by, refusing to acknowledge the parallels between student actions from decades past and now. McGuire, Gavin and Roth were different than I had expected. They were free-spirits who seemed to genuinely care about their student population; they were outspoken defenders of the fundamental values behind higher education. A breath of fresh air I so desperately crave from my own university. This got me thinking why elite universities, such as University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, Johns Hopkins and my own, have chosen to not speak out against the administration. “Presidents are paid too damn much sometimes, excuse my French,” McGuire answered my question. She’s right, after all, if you’re making millions, why would you take the risks necessary to protect vulnerable students? Defending education is not a political stance; it’s a moral obligation. One I hope you uphold.Duke, the world is watching. Will you lead, or will you hide?Noor Nazir is a Trinity sophomore."
America’s oldest Black town can teach us something about the lost art of democracy,Avery Smedley,2025-02-06T11:00:00Z,Feb,6,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/americas-oldest-black-town-20250206.html,"Democracy in America is becoming a lost art. One-third of American adults still doubt President Joe Biden’s legitimate election. Americans are increasingly losing trust in elections, elected officials and so many other features of American civic life. This leaves us with two paths forward: Either the public’s trust will be regained, or the nation will become ever-more fragmented by anxiety, fear and paranoia. At this critical juncture in American history, with the path increasingly unclear, we must look inward for answers. The solutions are all around, the most unlikely of which, coming from a place that should not even exist.Princeville, N.C. has been an anomaly since the town boundaries have existed on a map. Officially incorporated in 1885, but existing since the early days of Emancipation, it is the oldest Black town in America. Princeville has persisted through centuries of annexation and buy-out attempts, through consistent flooding and rebuilding, all amidst a backdrop of neglect and ambivalence from state and federal actors. Yet, Princeville still stands. Most of the town’s residents are the descendants of freed people who settled there long ago, including the mayor and commissioners. Co-raciality, a phenomenon in which elected officials share the same racial background as their constituents, is already uncommon, making this place that exists against all odds all the more exceptional. This is only becoming rarer and rarer as Black-autonomous towns like Princeville rapidly disappear. I investigated this phenomenon in my senior honors thesis, the results of which suggest that representation could matter more than we think. Black autonomous towns could make a marked difference in how civilians interact with local civic life.My case study of Princeville and a comparable segregated town suggests that Princevillians may be more engaged in and knowledgeable about local politics, as well as more trusting of their elected officials. As one resident put it, it makes a difference that the politicians are “people who look like me, who went through the same things ... as me.” Participants voted more often and found their politicians to be more approachable. In Princeville, it’s not uncommon to run into the mayor at the grocery store or to have grown up with one of the town commissioners.Princevillians share a deep pride in their collective history —and this means something to residents. Every conversation I had with a resident was marked by rich family histories going back generations. As strong as Princeville’s history is in motivating its citizens to vote, a diametric history in the segregated town across the bridge has the opposite effect. There, in Tarboro, the memory of Black Codes, Jim Crow and white supremacy is still visceral, constraining Black citizens’ political expression. A majority of residents noted apprehension around the tacit social hierarchy still in place, still dictated by race and class. In the rural South and beyond, this memory is alive and well. Princeville has stood as a rare symbol of resilience and freedom in a nation fraught with this potent and omnipresent legacy. It also stands as a rare model of co-racial representation and what close relationships between elected officials and their constituents could look like. Perhaps, in this regard, it even stands as a model for the rest of the country.While my data suggests that co-racial political representation may be linked to increases in civic engagement, political knowledge, trust in elected officials and belief in government responsiveness, this does not mean autonomous Black towns are perfect in their political landscapes. Tarboro and Princeville shared many of the same challenges in low voter turnout, lack of civic education and slow bureaucratic processes. Although imperfect, Princeville gets a lot of things right around representation and relationship building. The town’s existence lends itself to valuable insights around rebuilding trust and involvement in American civic life.Local governments like Princeville serve as exciting laboratories for reigniting civic engagement in a landscape of increasing nationwide democratic decline. As it stands, citizens do not interact with democratic decision-making often. American citizens vote less than citizens in other established democracies. When they do, it's primarily at the national level, which requires engagement once every four years or so and produces impacts that do not always feel connected to citizens’ day-to-day lives.A true commitment to rebuilding democracy recognizes local institutions as its building blocks. It is in local schools and town halls that citizens will most directly feel the effects of policy or their petitions for change. It is these experiences that grow civic skills and the impetus to continue to engage with politics on other levels. A true commitment to democracy looks like following in Princeville’s footsteps, such as increasing the number of co-racial candidates in office and making public servants more accessible to their constituents.For far too long, Princeville has been removed from history books and kept out of national conversations, lest it be to pity the town’s frequent flooding, which cannot be decontextualized as anything other than environmental racism. Centuries of negative attitudes toward Princeville have only been a disservice to the town and frankly, this nation. As our leaders begin picking up the pieces of our deeply fissured civic life, they would be remiss to ignore the answers playing out less than 300 miles from the nation’s capital in places like Princeville, N.C. Proper recognition and approbation are long overdue. Princeville deserves better. America deserves better, too. Avery Smedley is a Trinity senior."
Trump’s Executive Order 14160: Worrisome for American democracy,Harrison Walley,2025-02-05T11:00:00Z,Feb,5,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/trumps-executive-order-20250205.html,"After Donald Trump's second presidential election in November, I knew the erosion of immigration and citizenship rights would be quick to follow. However, I didn’t anticipate it would happen one day into his presidency.Trump’s Executive Order 14160 was signed on Jan. 20, 2025, and published nine days later. Intending to nullify the long-held tradition of birthright citizenship, EO 14160 weaponizes the unclear language of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, citing, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”The phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” is highlighted in Trump’s order. According to EO 14160, people born in the United States are not necessarily subject to the jurisdiction thereof, with the cutoff being “when that person's mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person's birth” or “when that person's mother's presence in the United States at the time of said person's birth was lawful but temporary ... and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person's birth.” Without pulling from judicial precedent, I want to first speak on the broader implications of EO 14160. In signing this order, Trump has given himself the power to interpret the Constitution, It is a gross expansion of executive power within the United States, which has already seen monumental increases throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. In addition, Trump's heavy use of executive orders has effects already adjacent to legislation, and legislation is strictly reserved for the Legislative Branch. After just over a week of his presidency, Trump's actions indicate a much larger issue that will likely permeate throughout his four years in office. Trump has assumed powers from all three branches of the federal government, potentially establishing the basis for unilateral presidential power. Should he desire, Trump may no longer be an executive limited by checks and balances; he now has an open path to a pseudo-dictatorship. Pulling from judicial precedent, the case against Trump becomes even more evident. The phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” is not an unclear phrase subject to presidential interpretation. In the 1898 Supreme Court case, United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of birthright citizenship, with the majority opinion by Justice Horace Gray reading, “Generally speaking, non-citizens must follow American laws when on American soil, so they are ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’ within the language of the Citizenship Clause. It can hardly be denied that an alien is completely subject to the political jurisdiction of the country in which he resides.” Seeing as all people on United States soil must abide by the rules and laws of the United States (with a few rare exceptions that Justice Gray expanded upon), all people born on United States soil should be considered citizens. Justice Gray also explicitly writes, “Neither the President nor Congress can change this rule; it is part of the Constitution.” This sentence makes it clear exactly what Trump is attempting to do. He is rejecting Supreme Court rulings and, by effect, the United States Constitution.The debate surrounding EO 14160 is understandably a very emotional, tense subject for people who are citizens through birthright. While it is minor consolation, the wording of EO 14160 is very explicit: “Subsection (a) of this section shall apply only to persons who are born within the United States after 30 days from the date of this order.” Although this backward, unconstitutional order may very well be frightening (and potentially opens a Pandora’s box of other anti-immigration policies), it is important to understand that birthright citizens who have issued documents should, if the federal government implements the order correctly, not be affected by Trump’s executive action. There are two major implications that everyone at Duke, especially birthright citizens, should be cognizant of. Firstly, we must avoid unintentionally spreading misinformation, which causes unnecessary anxiety. The political landscape we are living in is terrifying enough; ensure you are properly informed to avoid spreading panic. Secondly, you should know your rights when it comes to your citizenship. As it stands, documentation issued prior to EO 14160 (or within the 30-day grace period the order provides) is valid and must be accepted by local, state and federal governments. If you want to get involved in the fight against Trump’s unconstitutional EO 14160, consider joining local groups like Duke Beyond Borders, a student organization that “advocates for justice for immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers in the U.S.” Continue to follow national and local news. Donate to an organization like the American Civil Liberties Union, which is currently suing Trump over EO 14160. Executive actions that seek to deprive the people of their liberties can be paralyzing, but the only route by which we can stall the proliferation of anti-democratic policies is through widespread mobilization. Continue to protest, criticize and legally challenge Trump’s dictator-esque presidency. Harrison Walley is a Trinity first-year."
The transfer portal has taken over college sports: Is Greek life next?,Alex Berkman,2025-02-05T11:00:00Z,Feb,5,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/transfer-portal-greek-life-20250205.html,"On Dec. 9, former Duke starting Quarterback Maalik Murphy announced his decision to enter the transfer portal. As a result, the quarterback — who set the Duke record for most passing touchdowns in a single season — forfeited his eligibility to play in the Gator Bowl, Duke's most prestigious bowl appearance in decades. But what transpired after suggests that Murphy may have actually been pushed out by Duke. That is, on Dec. 10, former Tulane quarterback Darian Mensah was summoned by the Cameron Crazies to watch Duke men’s basketball dismantle - checks notes - Incarnate Word. Seriously, Manny? You couldn’t have brought him to a better game? The following day, Mensah announced his commitment to Duke, with reports indicating that the star quarterback would earn $8 million over the next two years — making him the highest-paid athlete in college football history.Still, I am absolutely certain that it was not the handsome paycheck, but the warm weather, elite academics and “It’s Thyme” that brought him to Duke. Nope, take that back — definitely wasn’t “It’s Thyme.”At this point, only two things remain to be said.First, you can suck it Tulane! Second, the transfer portal has completely redefined Greek life and college sports as we know it. Greek life? What the heck does this have to do with —Hello everyone. My name is Alex Berkman, and I am a proud brother of the Kappa — you know what, nevermind. With fraternity rush season now complete, it's time for a recap. This year was certainly an eventful one. Yike(s), ATOh-no, SadGuy, K AA (Alcoholics Anonymous), and Cig Chi all had impressive turnouts, each securing pledge classes of 25+: often snagging recruits who had received bids from other fraternities. But unfortunately, everyone cannot be a winner — and, there were certainly losers this year. Snuze you lose had yet another disappointing turnout despite the pageantry surrounding its name; meanwhile, Payne.Payne.Payne struggled to lure the international students away from their top competitor — SadGuy. However, it is what transpired after “Bid Turn In” that made this cycle truly interesting. Namely, a number of fraternities had appeared to develop a new strategy — one that experts have long cautioned against. Perhaps, just as sports adapt their playstyles over time, fraternities evolve in their own way.The strategy is quite straightforward actually, though clearly effective. Essentially, your goal is simple: During the two-week official rush period, put in the least amount of effort possible when recruiting new members. Don’t text them, don’t acknowledge their existence and never ever laugh at one of their jokes. But why stop there? If you really want to take it up a notch, don’t just avoid trying — actively drive them away! Be a jerk, spill your drink on them or shamelessly flirt with the rushee’s girlfriend. Now is your time to let loose, so take advantage! But once this unimportant period is over, it is now time to focus. As it stands, all of the freshmen that you bidded have accepted spots to other fraternities. As the freshmen you once spit on rejoice with their new pledge classes, it appears as though your fraternity is the Biggest Loser of rush. Brothers of your fraternity will panic. Calls will be placed to members' Wall Street parents, pleading for donations to keep your struggling frat afloat. But do not fret. This is precisely where you want to be.As author Michael Hopf once said, “Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times.” And you, my friend, are a strong man in a hard time. So, as the other fraternities frolic around to “Everytime We Touch” and bathe each other in champagne, it is now time to strike. With full force, you must lead a coordinated attack to reel in as many freshmen as possible. Do what needs to be done. Spread lies about the freshmen’s current fraternities, tell them that they will be the focal point of your offense, and most importantly, offer them lucrative NIL packages. However, be strategic in how you allocate NIL resources. That is, award funds strategically based on varying levels of talent. For the minnow, one free order of Nachos from Krafthouse will likely be enough to lure them into your frat. But for the big shark, a guaranteed spot at Goldman may not even be enough. You might have to endure a month of sailing the Caribbean with them on your yacht, no matter how insufferable they may be. Initially, it will be difficult to gain traction, to convince content freshmen into taking a leap of faith to join your seemingly dying fraternity. But this is a game of momentum, and once a few kids join, the floodgates will soon open. Within a week — maybe 10 days — post “Bid Turn In,” you my friend will be a member of the coolest fraternity on campus. Congratulations, and well done. Now, this was all of course an elaborate story, rooted in zero truth … or at least, we may only speculate the specific details of said NIL packages. What can be said with certainty is that the transfer portal has completely reshaped the landscape of college sports. And, it appears that there has been a residual effect on Greek life as well. With incompetent leadership at the helm of the NCAA, the Interfraternity Council (IFC) appears to have taken inspiration — holding as much authority over fraternity life as the lifeguard at an Olympic swim meet. Loyalty is no longer a part of the game, and it appears teams are now willing to play “dirty.” The question is — what do the remaining teams that still hold themselves to “honorable standards” do? Do they let themselves fall behind as a victim of their own pride? Or do they adapt to the ruthless ways of modern Greek — sorry, I mean college sports. Alex Berkman is a Trinity junior.

No midnight oil to burn: Keep the libraries open later on Fridays and Saturdays ,Cara Eaton,2025-02-04T11:00:00Z,Feb,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/keep-libraries-open-later-fridays-saturdays-20250204.html,"I read that Perkins was closing at 9 p.m.; I read it on the official Duke University Libraries website, yet I didn’t believe it. It was Dec. 6th. Why would Perkins close at only 9 p.m. when I have my final French paper due at midnight? Looking around and seeing how busy it was at 8:55, I could sense many other students were in the same predicament as me, especially at such a difficult time of the year. Yet, lo and behold, at 8:59, a security guard brusquely told us all to hit the road. Most disconcerting were the metal bars that Duke erected over the entrance of Perkins to prohibit anyone from getting in. It also prevented me from getting out through the main way, and I resigned to my fate of possibly sleeping on one of the Perkins couches (alright, I would have called security) until a classmate I had recognized from our mutually thwarted study session showed me a side-door exit he knew from similar evenings of yore. Many classmates with whom I discussed this experience related and disapproved of the early closing time. Keep the libraries open later, seriously, because a sizeable contingent wants them open later. Such concurrency is evident from the number of people still diligently studying to the final second before being forced out — and more plainly, from general sentiment. I haven’t heard any opinion to the contrary. Objection to library closing time seems to be one thing everyone agrees on: a very atypical but beautiful event. The only hypothetical counterargument I can imagine is the statement that while libraries are open until 12 or 1 a.m. on other weekdays, Friday and Saturday evenings are the weekend. It’s time to have fun and relax. I love to have fun as much as the next person, but I cannot relax when I have a French essay due that very night. Duke must either respond to the fact that many professors treat Friday as a perfectly feasible night to slap on a midnight due date and give us our libraries, or mandate that professors knock it off and give us our Friday nights — the former being the far more likely possibility. Friday and Saturday nights as a time for fun only further emphasizes why libraries need to stay open. If your roommate is having toomuch fun, and you’ve got that essay, what do you do? Common rooms tend to be just as rowdy, occupied by those who use them to hang out or transients back from a party. Sitting in the hallway with your laptop is demoralizing. You’ve got that essay biting at you, and you can’t even escape natural light-fueled debauchery in favor of the quiet refuge of the Gothic Reading Room. Let’s dig into the heart of the issue. Nobody’s buying that Duke lacks the resources to keep the libraries open later. Sure, Duke libraries might be “facing budget constraints” and maintain their finances internally, but this seems like a more significant issue affecting the financial organization of the university itself, which could be solved by a group of people that have a firmer understanding of economic allocation than a Chronicle opinion writer trying to capture the vox populi. Could the resources used for keeping the libraries open be reallocated to something more “important”? Sure. Duke could allocate the funds needed to keep the libraries open for cancer research or something. But they’re not: in fact, a representative of Duke libraries states they plan to reallocate the funds towards “other library needs” (staff training and update of decor), toothless expenditures that are far less “important” in a student’s daily life than the pressing need to use the library on a Friday night when running up against a deadline. Other reasons given for this change include reducing environmental impact (adjusting lighting and HVAC settings is a more targeted way of negating the already minimal ecological harm caused by these few extra hours) and concern for student sleep schedules. If a student has a pressing midnight due date, they will stay up to get it in at midnight, regardless. They won’t just give up at 9 p.m. and go to sleep upon the library's closure. What they leave the library to return to is more study, just more inconvenienced study. Pretending that Duke students are tangibly going to study less because the library is closed is absurd. I’ve had a couple of library nights on Fridays. They’re an important thing. Sometimes you have to have them, mused a fellow sophomore. Instead of penny-pinching (when there’s really no need for frugality) and virtue-signaling about student health concerns (without taking fruitful steps to remedy student health), Duke needs to listen to students here.

On glass and rubber balls: Happy Valentine’s Day,Advikaa Anand,2025-02-04T11:00:00Z,Feb,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/glass-rubber-balls-valentines-20250204.html,"Like many other students at Duke University, my greatest fear in high school was failure. When I went to sleep at night, my mind would fester with a thousand frightening visions of how I might fail: not getting good grades, not getting into college and not getting a good job. These anxieties would rest only with my slumber, springing awake once more when day would dawn. But after coming to college, my fear of failure has abated slightly through constant confrontation. Applying to selective academic and professional opportunities at the Duke, such as elite pre-professional societies or scholar programs, means acquiescing to the fact that failure is almost certain, not because we cannot match up to our peers in terms of ability or talent but because there are so many of us and only so many of these opportunities. This fear of professional or academic failure has been usurped by a new kind of fear: a fear of failure in personal relationships. College heralds into our lives a complex plethora of new relationships: roommates, blockmates and friends that you spend time with far more than simply during lunch break or on the weekends, as it was in high school. It also brings with it the obligation to keep stitching the threads of relationships that we left behind — connections that, while we are away, can unravel without consistent effort and time. We have hearts bursting with infinite love and gratitude for all the joy with which these various relationships color our lives yet also, a limited supply of time and energy that we are able to dedicate towards nurturing each one of them. And the grief that grips us when a relationship unravels not because we have wronged each other but because we are simply unable to give any more of ourselves to others is a crushing one. We have no one to blame, and that is the worst part. So, how do we curate this perfect balancing act between all of our glass balls — the relationships and obligations that filter so much light into our lives yet also the ones so fragile that if dropped, they may shatter permanently. To be honest, I do not know. As someone consumed by the desire to keep everyone in her life as happy as possible, I often perceive disappointments by the most important people in my life as a personal failure. In an attempt to juggle all of my glass balls, I often end up with wounds in my own hands when they fracture. These wounds take a toll on my mental health and weigh heavy on my heart.I am still navigating how to clean up some of these broken pieces, but I think reframing the way I mentally perceive my glass balls is an excellent place to begin. While it is a responsibility to juggle all of these delicately and properly, it is also a privilege — to love and to be loved by so many in our lives who are pained at the thought of not experiencing all of ourselves all of the time. I am learning how to appreciate the fragility of these glass balls for the ways in which they warm my heart and percolate the light into my life that makes it worth living. I am also on a journey to find and strengthen my rubber balls — the ones I can let slip from my gawky fingers and rest in the assurance that they will simply bounce back up into my hands. These rubber balls are the relationships I can trust will certainly not falter if I am not able to dedicate all of my time and energy all of the time. While very few relationships are complete rubber balls (after all, all relationships are nurtured through efforts), I find that the ones mixed with glass are those that most serve as a space for healing, nurture and comfort. This Valentine’s Day, I am determined to honor these glass-rubber balls with a little extra affection. I am so lucky to have people that consider my time and affection a gift in their lives, and I hope to honor them by reflecting back the light they sift into my life. Most importantly, I hope to save some tenderness for the glass ball that contains them all: my own heart. Advikaa Anand is Trinity junior. Her columns run on alternating Tuesdays."
Breath support,Luke A. Powery,2025-02-03T13:00:00Z,Feb,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/breath-support-20250203.html,"Curtis Mayfield was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, record producer and one of the most influential musicians behind socially conscious soul music. He was such a soul man that his son eventually wrote a biography about his father called ""Traveling Soul."" And what a road he traveled. As part of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame group ""The Impressions,"" Mayfield wrote the song ""People Get Ready,"" which ranks twenty-fourth on Rolling Stone’slist of the 500 greatest songs of all time. You have probably heard it: ""People get ready/There's a train a comin'/You don't need no baggage/You just get on board…"" On Aug. 13, 1990, Mayfield was asked to headline an R&B concert at Wingate Field in Brooklyn, New York. He was waiting in the wings, as the other acts — the Delfonics, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes—performed. A storm began to brew. With 10,000 excited fans in attendance, the event promoter felt that the show had to go on despite the swirling winds. Mayfield’s band rushed out and did a sound check. They started playing the notes to the song ""Superfly,"" which was Curtis’s cue to come on stage. As he walked on, poised to take the microphone from the event promoter, a huge gust of wind blew, and a lighting tower came crashing onto the stage, missing the percussionist but destroying his drum kit as it fell towards Mayfield. It struck him on the neck, shattering the third, fourth, and fifth vertebrae. He lay still on the stage, drifting in and out of consciousness as the rain beat down hard, thunder crashing and objects flying off stage into the panicked audience. Several people were hurt, and at age forty-eight, Curtis Mayfield was paralyzed from the neck down for the remainder of his life. Mayfield could no longer play the guitar or move his lower body, but the soul music pioneer refused to give up. His first and last studio release after the incident in Brooklyn was his 1996 album ""New World Order,"" whose title song became the theme song for Spike Lee’s movie ""Get on the Bus."" And do you know how this paralyzed man recorded this final album? He laid on his back allowing gravity to pull into his lungs the oxygen necessary to sing — one line at a time.“You just have to deal with what you got, try to sustain yourself as best as you can and look to the things that you can do,” Mayfield said in an interview after his accident. That’s how he responded to his life change. Through pain, on his back, he sang lyrics like ""Summer, winter or just cold … through the rain and through the snow… Let’s get on back to living again … Now it's always the right time/With somethin' positive in your mind/There's always someone to pull you down/you just get back up and hold your ground. Let’s get back to living again.""Mayfield could still sustain enough breath support to go on living, but this isn’t always true for others. Breath can be knocked out of you for good. You may not realize its value until it’s gone, especially when it is the last breath of a loved one in hospice or in a plane crash. When breath is gone, life is gone, and the music stops. Sometimes breath expires due to natural causes, while other times, the violence of kneeing or choking causes a person to say, ""I can’t breathe.""There are times when we can lack breath support and don’t freely breathe as we should, whether physically or metaphorically. This became clear for one preacher at the wrong time. She was fired up in the speaking moment. Her volume was high, and her rhythm was beating like a drum. Her pitch was at full throttle as she rose to the heights of a vocal musical celebration, taking the excited congregation along with her for the spiritual ride. The congregation was celebrating with her via call and response when all of a sudden her pace and intensity got the best of her. She was on a high, but her breath support was low, so low that right at the point when she was about sing or intone at the climax, she fainted!Beyond the literal lack of breath support, there is the figurative loss of breath. One afternoon a woman named Rose and I were sitting in a restaurant sharing a meal together. Rose began telling me about her relationship with her husband over the years and how he had abused her and her daughter, and yet she remained married to him. At one point in the conversation, after hearing the horrific stories and seeing the tears of pain drop from her face, I said to her, ""That’s not living."" Rose responded, ""Luke, I died a long time ago."" She was a member of the walking dead, an empty shell because, metaphorically, she had no life within her, no breath. When breath is gone from others, it affects all of us. I say this following Dr. Ashon Crawley, a professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia, who writes in his book ""Blackpentecostal Breath"" that breathing is ""exorbitantly social."" An instructor of cinematic arts here at Duke, Archer Boyette, created a multimedia installation titled ""we breathe each other in and out of existence."" In an interview about her work, Boyette said: ""On the surface, 'we breathe each other in and out of existence' seems like a grandiose or lofty statement, but it’s really just fundamentally true. It’s a fact, our interdependence with plants and our connectedness. We literally facilitate each other’s breath.""It is possible to offer breath support to each other rather than sucking the life out of each other. We shouldn’t have to wait for a tragedy to happen like it did with Mayfield. So, while we have breath, let’s sing together with Mayfield, ""A new world order, a brand new day/ A change of mind for the human race … / It's a new day / Yes, Lord, it's a brand new day.""The Rev.

"Air Jordan drops UNC, proposes sponsoring Duke after Saturday's showing",Monday Monday,2025-02-03T11:00:00Z,Feb,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/air-jordan-drops-unc-monday-monday-20250203.html,"Editor's note: The article below is satire.In an unprecedented move that has sent shockwaves through college basketball, M. Jordan has reportedly decided to move his iconic Air Jordan brand from his alma mater to their arch-rival Duke. He was secretly in attendance at the game Saturday night, and after witnessing the Blue Devils' dominant performance, he reached out to the Nike CEO to make the switch to Duke. He ended the call with, “I only deal with winners.”The day after Duke’s glorious win, he flew the Blue Devil team and coaches to the Air Jordan Oregon headquarters. He greeted the team outside, quickly brought them to his office as UNC alumni fawned over, and swarmed the team for pictures. One former Tar Heel was spotted asking a Duke walk-on to sign his Jordan jersey.Once inside, Jordan pitched that the players and coaches could all pick out the colors and styles of their own shoes. The guys got to choose from 40 colors, 30 of which were shades of medium to dark blue. Some proposed names for the new shoe line ranged from ""Proc-walks"" to ""Brotherhood Boosts"" to even ""Air Bordens"" to give the lesser-known players a chance to make an extra buck. When asked by the players what would happen to UNC since Jordan’s products are all over their stadium, he shared that he had negotiated other sponsorship arrangements for his alma mater. While it was hard to find someone willing to take on a 13-10 team, one brand was more than eager to jump at the chance of sponsoring their first college team ever: Skechers. Skechers eagerly posted to social media that they’re excited for players to experience the “Comfort Pillow™” in the heel of their shoes. Some potential shoe names for the new Carolina line are the ""No Final Four Foam"" and the ""Nothing but Bricks."" Skechers said they would happily supply the team with shoes and new home and away jerseys, but replacing all Air Jordan merchandise in the athletic store might be a little out of their price range. The company offered to supply at least three pairs of shoes per player, pending availability.Additionally, Jordan has reportedly begun the process of having his jersey unretired from the UNC rafters. Sources close to him say he wants the number back in circulation so people will finally stop associating 23 with the UNC program. The UNC athletic department is in negotiations to replace the now-empty Jordan tribute with a Skechers Light-Ups™ banner instead.After Nike and Jordan's hours-long pitch, Duke simply responded, ""Nah, we’re good."" They concluded that such a move would lower the market value of the Duke brand.Monday Monday would like to alert readers that Jordan also proposed to be the Duke 2025 Commencement speaker to distance himself further from the Tar Heels. However, the university’s president also refused this proposal, telling Jordan, “To Hell with Carolina. Let’s go Duuuuke!”"

We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!” On Jan. 18, TikTok displayed this message to its hundreds of millions of American users. For Gen-Z, the banning of TikTok, a cornerstone of entertainment and information in the digital age, felt like a nightmare. This sentiment resonated across the country; personally, every single conversation I had with a fellow Duke student on Jan. 18 centered on our sadness about the TikTok ban. Yet we kept the app on our phones and hoped that this ban would be overturned — after all, the message did not simply deliver bad news. It offered a beacon of hope via President Trump. And just 12 hours later, on Jan. 19, TikTok resumed as normal after presenting this message to its users: “Welcome back! Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!” Trump’s efforts consisted of a post to Truth Social, in which he stated that he would issue an executive order to delay the enforcement of the law’s restrictions, to create a new deal to ensure national security. Trump further promised that no company that helped TikTok stay live before his order would be liable, which allowed TikTok to be instantly reinstated. Although seemingly insignificant to non-TikTok users or older demographics, the unbanning of TikTok was meaningful to most of Gen-Z. Regardless of their political stances toward Trump, most appreciated his efforts that would restore their beloved app. It is crucial to recognize the unusual dynamics at play in this situation. The mere mention of Trump’s name on the app’s notification reflects not only an unsettling level of presidential influence over digital platforms, but a deliberate effort to garner attention and endorsement. Even more importantly, that many TikTok users responded with gratitude and support signals Trump’s talent for manipulating public perception.Trump recognized the current dependency on social media and weaponized it to bolster public approval. His restoration of TikTok must not be seen as a simple act to help his constituents; rather, it was a strategic move to consolidate power and paint himself as the savior — a maneuver he has utilized repeatedly.This strategy is best understood through a comprehensive look at the history leading up to the TikTok ban. On Aug. 6, 2020, during his first term in office, Trump signed an executive order to ban TikTok, deeming the app’s Chinese ownership a national security threat. For five years, no headway was made, but just two days before Trump’s inauguration, the ban was instated. Trump was the reason all of this chaos ensued, yet he used his soon-to-be presidential power to end the ban. While this seems nonsensical, it is understood through the lens of Trump’s political agenda and pattern: Trump creates a crisis, lets public panic ensue and then steps in with a solution to appear the savior.TikTok is not the only issue where he has employed this strategy. Trump exemplified similar political maneuvers by intervening in immigration policies. The Border Act was introduced to the Senate in May 2024 of former President Biden’s term. This was a bipartisan immigration reform bill: it worked to prevent transnational human and fentanyl trafficking, streamline immigration processing, increase the number of border security personnel, and more. Despite its claimed benefits and bipartisan nature, it was denied in a 43-50 vote, with only one GOP “yea” vote. Republican support of this bill fell apart, and in the past presidential debate, former Vice President Kamala Harris blamed Trump. Harris stated, “You know what happened to that bill? Donald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress, and said “Kill the Bill”. You know why? Because he’d prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.” The last line rings true. One of Trump’s main policy priorities since his 2016 campaign has been immigration reform. Yet Trump actively opposed a huge bill aimed at just that. In doing this, his platform on immigration remains a problem that needs to be solved, and he offers himself up as the only solution. This is not governance and protecting constituents; this is self-serving manipulation and performance art. Trump is a calculated shaper of narratives, skillfully placing himself as the indispensable hero America needs. Trump dictates not only the issues citizens should prioritize but also who they should credit for solving them.TikTok may seem like a trivial lens to explore Trump’s political tactics, especially amid the broader impact of his policies — freezing federal aid, restricting gender identity to two categories, withdrawing from The Paris Agreement. However, TikTok serves as a microcosm of Trump’s philosophy and motivations, in which he inflates his importance to portray himself as the rescuer of Americans from “chaos.” This chaos, though, is often manufactured by Trump himself, a mere tool of manipulation. Trump is often deemed a “loose cannon,” but it is better to recognize him for what he really is: a masterful manipulator of public perception. As the next four years of Trump’s administration unfold, it is essential for Americans to recognize this pattern of political opportunism by a government designed to serve and protect them.Aria Dwoskin is a Trinity first-year.

North Carolina: Ground zero for right-wing policy,Adam Levin,2025-02-02T11:00:00Z,Feb,2,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/north-carolina-ground-zero-right-wing-policy-20250202.html,"A few weeks ago, I began receiving frantic texts from friends asking if their ballots — ones they cast two months ago — were successfully counted. I checked my Instagram and saw stories of people who had lived in North Carolina their entire lives and even voted in previous elections, whose votes were in jeopardy of being discarded. If you’re unaware, although it’s been 89 days since Election Day, one North Carolina judicial candidate — and incoming Duke Law student — still can’t accept defeat. Jefferson Griffin, a candidate who lost by 734 votes out of 5.5 million cast in the state Supreme Court election, has gone through every possible legal means to avoid admitting he didn’t win. First, he asked for two recounts, which only widened his opponent’s lead over him. Then, he brought his case to the Board of Elections, which was promptly dismissed. Now, he is challenging around 65,000 votes in court, desperately trying to overturn the results of a democratically-decided election. Griffin isn’t challenging these votes indiscriminately. Youth voters are more than 3.4 times more likely to have their votes included in the lawsuit than those aged 65+, and in Durham, that number skyrockets to seven times more likely. That means that Duke students are disproportionally affected by this challenge — on our campus alone, the lawsuit names 750 students. Ironically, on a college campus like Duke, voting and voter registration resources are far more accessible. Having worked with Duke Votes, I remember how carefully each student filled out their registration form, some even multiple times — it’s hard to imagine that 750 students at Duke cast completely invalid ballots. The potential disenfranchisement of a significant portion of Duke voters has unique effects: Political engagement is imbued into our campus culture and many students plan to enter political fields after graduation. Just this year, 11 Duke community members were on national or local ballots. Devastating students’ ability to engage in the electoral system could dissuade their future interest in politics, especially for the students of color that Griffin was more likely to name. However, none of these attempts to overturn pluralistic democracy are new, nationally or statewide, or even from Duke students — after all, we’re the alma mater of white nationalists Stephen Miller and Richard Spencer. In November, the Arizona Supreme Court rejected Kari Lake’s seventh, yes, seventh,bid to overturn the 2022 Senate Election Results. In 2021, 147 congressional Republicans voted against certifying the presidential election. If this case seems both particularly extreme and frighteningly likely to succeed, that’s because it is. The North Carolina Supreme Court, which temporarily blocked the election from being certified, is stacked with a conservative majority and appears likely to uphold Jefferson’s false claims. Beyond devastating any legitimacy in our system and creating a long-lasting imbalance in the North Carolina Supreme Court, such a decision would set a dangerous precedent nationally. If so, it wouldn’t be the first time North Carolina has served as a testing ground for far-right policies. The Republican strategy in North Carolina is tried and true: Introduce an unpopular and extreme policy, deal with the backlash until it subsides and then incorporate the policy on a national scale. Pass the bill, weather the storm and watch as the policy catches fire. In 2016, for example, North Carolina lawmakers passed the controversial “bathroom bill,” also known as HB2, which forced people to use bathrooms based on their gender assigned at birth. The backlash was swift and intense — PayPal canceled a significant expansion, the NCAA canceled its tournament games and performers like Bruce Springsteen boycotted the state. One estimate declared that North Carolina would lose $3.76 billion over a dozen years as a direct result of the law. Even though, over a year later, the legislature ended up repealing part of the law, the bill began a national push to restrict the rights of transgender Americans. North Carolina strategists convinced other states to rally around the issue — and as we now know, the question of trans athletes in sports has caught fire nationally. The issue that once caused such dramatic backlash, the bathroom bill, has been adopted in some form in eleven states. The same thing is happening right now with gubernatorial powers. Since 2017, a Democrat has held the North Carolina governor’s office, but Republicans have held a convincing majority, or even supermajority, in the state legislature. In 2016, just before the Democrat took office, Republicans rushed through restrictions on the governor’s powers, removing his ability to appoint certain positions on courts and boards and cutting his workforce by two-thirds. Just weeks ago, before losing their supermajority, they took their efforts to a new level. I implore you to read the whole list, but for a few highlights — or maybe lowlights:The law takes away the governor’s power to appoint any member of the Board of Elections, putting every member of the board into the hands of Republicans for the foreseeable future.It requires the governor to choose certain judicial appointees based on a list provided by the person vacating their seat — meaning that if a Republican leaves, a Republican would have to be appointed. It bars the Attorney General from taking any stances in lawsuits that contradict the official position of the legislature. While not at the scale of HB2, the law received substantial backlash for contravening the balance of power of the executive and legislative branches and hiding the power grab in a bill that nominally aided Appalachia. However, that hasn’t stopped the spread of their political ruthlessness. In 2016, states such as Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio and Wisconsin mimicked the legislature’s policy, to varying degrees. The State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin concluded that this recent power grab could inspire the same type of extreme tactics nationwide. Over and over, the North Carolina Republican strategy is the same: pass, weather, watch. So what can we do? First, we can check that our ballots are not named in Griffin’s lawsuit. If you voted absentee or early in North Carolina, use this list to search for your name and ensure that your vote is not in danger of being discarded. If it is, your best course of action is to contact the Board of Elections and check if they need additional information or if there’s any way to remedy your ballot. In a race decided by a margin of hundreds of ballots, your challenge could quite literally be the difference. Second, we shouldn’t let one power grab fly under the radar simply because Griffin’s election challenge is a more public threat to North Carolina’s democracy. After all, however unlikely they might succeed, the governor’s and attorney general’s offices are currently suing to block the legislature’s recent restriction of executive powers. Additionally, as pessimistic as this article might sound, the previous actions of the legislature also produced incredibly significant grassroots movements. HB2 strengthened the queer rights movement that passed numerous non-discrimination ordinances across North Carolina. The Moral Monday civil disobedience movement — an alliance of progressive faith leaders and activists founded in 2013 to combat the legislature’s policies — brought thousands of protestors to the legislature and is restarting its mobilization efforts now. We are currently in the weather stage of the strategy. Do your civic duty and check your vote, but do the right thing and don’t let the storm pass.Adam Levin is a Trinity first-year.

From Berlin to Duke: A tale for the uncertain at heart,Lisa Maria Stirbu,2025-01-31T11:00:00Z,Jan,31,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/from-berlin-to-duke-20250131.html,"The Berlin airport was overwhelmingly crowded when I arrived at noon on a random Wednesday. People rushed past me, some visibly eager to begin well-deserved vacations, others in crisp suits, hurrying to catch flights to their next business meetings. And then there I was: stock-still as I eagerly scanned the crowd, searching for a friend who was supposed to meet me.My parents, of course, had a hundred other concerns on their minds. Did I really pack my charger? Were my documents in order and readily available? And, perhaps the most pressing question: Was I sure I even wanted to go?Did I want to go?It made my head spin. When I received my acceptance letter to Duke, I’d felt no hesitation. I remember that moment vividly: sitting in my university library, surrounded by friends, waist-deep in exam prep for an accounting class, when that particular email reached me. My initial reaction at that time consisted of endless joy, gratefulness and a surreal, floaty fleeing at what was about to happen. I certainly knew that I was going. But had I ever truly considered what leaving my home would entail?Standing at the airport, excitement, nerves and a bittersweet lingering sadness washed over me. I finally understood. My mental preparation since that email, months of planning out every small yet relevant detail, from which flights to take to scanning the campus map vigorously to visualize my future study routes, did not prepare me for the actual feeling of leaving. The weight of leaving my home, the only home I had truly known for 20 years, finally sank in.And then I spotted my friend. He looked just as anxious yet simultaneously excited as I was.Our parents, being parents, immediately huddled together, sharing their feelings of enormous pride, all states of worry, and above all, their vast sorrow over our impending departure. Was it already time to go? I stood next to them, very much dissociating, engulfed in the enormity of it all. Who just randomly decides to leave their old life behind and move to the other side of the world, to a university they have never visited, even never heard of prior to applying, in a country and city they have never been to? It seemed like one of the riskiest decisions I could have ever made at that time.And yet, I made it.Arriving at Duke after 11 hours' worth of flights and the accompanying sleep deprivation mixed with exhilaration, I realized my absolute lack of organizational skills. No dollars in hand, no American phone number to call the RA who was supposed to let me in my dorm, and my complete absence of mobile data kept me on my feet until midnight, navigating an entirely new world on my own.Once I entered my new home, the dorm and the unfamiliar space I would be expected to share with a complete stranger for the next year, everything seemed to align. The uncertainty and planning over the past few months, the logistical chaos of my arrival, and all of my bittersweet goodbyes and lingering sadness that I carried with me to Duke, they all seemed to make sense to me now. For the first time, I seemed to acknowledge: I had made it.For international students like me, moving across the world to study at a world-renowned, elite university does not solely entail superior academics. There are so many more variables. It is much more about learning to navigate a completely new culture, an entirely new set of social norms that seem so absurd yet normal here, a new educational system, and, after everything, such small yet relevant things like figuring out where to buy groceries or how to introduce yourself to people without feeling completely out of place. It is scary, disorienting and overwhelming at times.Standing in my vast, empty new room, I finally came to the realization that every Duke student, whether from a small town in North Carolina or a city halfway across the Atlantic Ocean, shares the exact same feeling of stepping into the unknown. As I tirelessly started unpacking my life, stuffed into two ridiculously small suitcases, I understood that this journey was not about leaving my known home. It was about building a new one. And although I felt so distant and different from everyone else in that moment, like I didn’t belong, this was the moment I understood that, in some way, we all did. This is the beginning of my story, a story I share with everyone around me, one that is uncertain, exhilarating, and full of change, but ultimately, it is a story of a new sense of belonging at Duke.Lisa Maria Stirbu is a Trinity junior on exchange from Berlin."
Golden or gilded? Trump’s inauguration sends an ominous message to the working class,"Quaid Sutherland, Polyna Uzun",2025-01-30T11:00:00Z,Jan,30,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/golden-or-gilded-20250130.html,"The weekend of the 2025 presidential inauguration, Washington, D.C. hosted a legion of Trump fans donning red MAGA hats, American flags and patriotically charged costumes. The so-called “silent majority” had found its voice and showed out, sporting their finest red attire. Driving four hours from Durham, NC, we went to conduct interviews and take photos, observing Trump’s return to the White House. Walking through the Washington subway on the morning of Jan. 19 — the day before the inauguration — bits of scarlet hastily bobbed through the crowd. Undeterred by Washington’s sub-freezing temperatures and wind chill, determined admirers power walked out of the station. Outside, they joined thousands of others in line for Trump’s final “Victory Rally” in the Capital One Arena. Polyna UzunA crowd of Trump supporters with a church in the background endure hours of sleet, snow and hail, hoping to gain entrance into the Trump “Victory Rally.”Through the afternoon, supporters inched their way through the snaking line hoping to gain entrance into the arena. As the 3 p.m. kickoff neared, supporters still trudged through frozen mud as an onslaught of rain, sleet, snow and hail frizzed the the tight, blonde curls of middle-aged women and dampened the clothes of the ill-prepared. Lacking volunteers or organizers, prospective attendees relied on disinterested police to guide them through a series of steel gates and concrete checkpoints. While the path of the crowd was heavily secured, the line itself was governed by assertive personalities where legitimate authority fell short. Self-enforcement reigned as frustrated men threatened to physically confront line cutters, all in front of their young, onlooking children.By 3:30 p.m., after six hours in the twisting line, we stepped through a break in the towering fence. From outside the pack, turning corner after corner, we had a view unattainable to those still plodding forward — the procession was a futile mess. Rather than celebratory, the atmosphere was one of frustration and betrayal as those who’d waited for hours realized they would never get seats. Although there had been no formal announcement, it became clear to many that the doors had closed long ago, leading thousands to leave the line, scrambling and forcing their way into the futile red crush surrounding the arena.Polyna UzunA merch vendor puffing on a hookah waits for customers in the freezing weather.On the edge of the fenced crowd, an old woman, seemingly alone, sat shivering against the gate. Paying no mind, tired and cold supporters moved forward as the woman struggled to her feet. As we left the mass clumped by the Capital One entrance, a cold slush began falling once again and the merchandise hawkers’ cotton winter MAGA hats suddenly became “water-proof.”That night, those disappointed by their inability to get into the Victory Rally learned from their mistakes, determined to arrive earlier for Monday’s public post-inaugural celebration — also hosted at the Capitol One Arena — as redemption. Some never left the crowd in front of the arena, sleeping on the concrete in improvised camps for a chance to see Trump in the flesh. In the dark early hours of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, overshadowed by Trump’s second inauguration, supporters yet again made their way through the fenced line winding in front of the same arena. Quaid SutherlandIn the early hours of Monday morning, a man in Trump-branded military attire heads a small procession walking to the inauguration line chanting Trump-themed songs, while a woman smokes a cigarette, donning a MAGA rice hat.The people were out and the energy was high. By 5:30 a.m., thousands were already in line. Police and the National Guard paced in front of checkpoints and armored trucks blocked off intersections. A middle-aged Asian-American man dressed in a general costume repeatedly passed beside the crowd, waving an American flag, chanting Trump slogans and saluting fellow supporters. A woman, wearing a “Never Surrender” rice paddy hat, followed closely behind. In the dense queue, a man waving another American flag beckoned us to snap his photo, which led to a conversation with a former Trump campaign volunteer. Our chat was cut short as the woman eagerly joined a booming “U-S-A” chant ripping its way through the crowd. Merch vendors, some busing all the way from the Bronx, woke up bright and early, ready to hustle. Every facet of Trump’s personality, image and brand was commodified in merchandise, much of which was ironically made in China. MAGA T-shirts, scarves and winter hats were the most sought-after items in the sub-freezing temperatures; however, vendors also displayed tackier items including golden chains affixed with Trump bobbleheads and automatronic Trump dolls banging cymbals. Many supporters wore red visors with his signature orange swoop peaking out, or shirts with “I’m voting for the felon and the hillbilly.” In the vast line, supporters mimicked Trump’s dance moves, mannerisms and speaking style. Polyna UzunMerch vendors promoting their products pass under D.C. Chinatown’s ""Friendship Archway"" in frigid hours before sunrise.This same file weaved through the heart of Chinatown, under the Friendship Arch, a traditional paifang. The irony was clear as both Biden and Trump’s national security strategies have centered on managing tensions between the U.S. and China. Foreign reporters wearing neutral palettes peppered the red crowd, having crossed oceans for the opportunity to interview and snap photos of the often carnival-like spectacle. Polyna UzunA man scales a parking meter and fence to address the Trump supporters waiting to enter Capital One Arena.A man mounted a parking meter and shouted, “Doesn’t this feel like one big family reunion!?” A roar of affirmation erupted from the almost exclusively white crowd. Despite the confident proclamation, thinking back to the elderly woman who’d been sitting along, his words felt empty. What kind of family doesn’t come to the aid of the vulnerable? The individualism of the pro-Trump crowd contrasted starkly with the weekend’s simultaneous left-wing counter-protests, which emphasized community solidarity and grassroots organization. At the Party for Socialism and Liberation Rally, volunteers wearing neon safety vests maintained order for the march while others towed wagons and handed out free PB&Js, water and hand warmers. As many fought off the inauguration’s morning chill, savvy opportunists walked by with buckets of hand warmers and steaming hot coffee — for a price of course. Passing a woman handing out stickers for the Daily Wire, we asked her whether she was a fan of Ben Shapiro, founder and leading face of the conservative media company. “I don’t know what that is,” she responded. Polyna UzunA man reaches front of the line to enter Capital One Arena, removing his hat to pass through security scanners. By the light of the morning, people started trickling through security. As supporters crossed the final layer of fencing, they filed through concrete dividers on which photographers perched, snapping aerials of the incoming crowd. Heaps of garbage and the remains of tents and sleeping bags, abandoned by the diehard supporters who’d slept in line, surrounded the entrance. Snickers, hand warmers, tangerines and even a full bottle of Bacardi were left behind as people dropped their non-essentials before security screening. Those unfortunate enough to have kept bags or prohibited valuables frantically begged trustworthy-looking passerbys to hold onto their cameras and iPads. A woman who’d been waiting since 2:30 a.m. complained shrilly to anyone in earshot that her Louis Vuitton bag wasn’t permitted past the checkpoint. A stocky and fully inked security guard stood above the crowd hoarsely yelling, “If you have hats, take them off and put them in your hats,” mixing up his instructions after hours of shouting.Quaid SutherlandA security guard prepares to yell instructions to lucky attendees preparing to be screened while photographers shoot.When Trump’s official inaugural ceremony began in the Capitol Building, his hardcore supporters waited a mile away, praying for a chance to get into the arena. They breathed warmth into their hands and bought overpriced merchandise, talking about the dawn of a new “Golden Age.” Simultaneously, a crisply dressed Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg casually took their warm seats in the front row of Trump's inauguration ahead of incoming Cabinet members. Spending over $270 million on Trump's campaign, Musk has carved out a central role for himself in the incoming administration as leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Trump's right-hand man. His meteoric and uniquely public ascent into Trump’s inner circle blatantly demonstrates the outsized power and control money buys in our pay-to-play political system. However, Trump supporters at the inauguration expressed little concern about Musk’s proximity to power. Their sentiment was summarized by — he’s the richest man in the world, clearly he’s got some good ideas. When asked about Musk's massive conflicts of interest, a man waved the question off: “I’m not too worried.”Polyna UzunDonald Trump and Kim Jong Un impersonators wait in line to enter Capital One Arena.After taking the oath of office, Trump’s motorcade brought him to 20,000 adoring fans in the Capital One Arena, where a painfully awkward Musk raised controversy over an overt Nazi salute. Whether this was terminally-online rage bait or a “Roman salute” is irrelevant. The immediate torrent of excuses and lack of condemnation is uncomfortable, but unfortunately not surprising as even the most poisonous political rhetoric becomes normalized in American politics. Meanwhile, Trump signed Executive Orders, launching the pens into a roaring crowd. In the first hours of his presidency, Trump instituted pardons for Jan. 6 rioters, attempted to end birthright citizenship, withdrew from the Paris Climate Accords and removed protections for civil servants.Polyna UzunA man wearing an American flag-themed suit poses with a hand to his ear in front of the line to get into the Capital One Arena.Trump’s erratic first week in office promised strength but brought chaos. The blitzkrieg of Executive Orders and scandalous Cabinet appointments has overwhelmed opposition from both sides of the aisle. On the left, bandwidth has been stretched thin by Stephen Miller’s “flood-the-zone” tactic, while on the right, Republicans unconvinced by Trump’s policies or appointments are threatened with well-funded primary challenges by TPUSA and Elon Musk. Although many of Trump’s Executive Orders already face legal challenges, the policies’ draconian effects are materializing close to home. On campus, Duke undergraduate organizations have begun to warn students to prepare for potential raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency conveniently invited to this week’s career fair. Despite centering the working class in his campaign, Trump has filled his Cabinet with billionaires whose combined net worth exceeds the GDP of 172 countries. Although supposedly championing meritocracy, the administration is stocked with friends, family and big donors. Such appointments draw attention to the striking divide between the populist messaging that attracted Trump’s voters and the oligarchic reality of his administration. Quaid SutherlandA protester holds a sign in front of the Lincoln Memorial at the 2025 People’s March.Although obvious to many watching the inauguration, those celebrating at the Capital One Arena either didn’t register or didn’t mind the blatant display of wealth seated behind Trump as he began his second term. When only the rich, well-connected and lucky got seats to Trump’s exclusive inauguration in the Capitol, while the majority of his supporters were left in the cold, one has to wonder whether Trump’s new age will be golden or gilded.Polyna Uzun and Quaid Sutherland are Trinity seniors."
Hopefully someday I can go back home,Myat Theingi,2025-01-29T11:00:00Z,Jan,29,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/hopefully-someday-go-back-home-20250129.html,"I die a little whenever we are close to term breaks. The images of my peers happily dragging their luggage and leaving for their homes always pull severe emotional strings inside me. When that happens, I keep thinking, “When will it be my turn, if ever?”I have not returned to my country in the past fall and winter breaks, and obviously not in the spring. To be fair, a handful of international students on financial aid would share my experience.But then, what about the summer? All international students will be returning to their homelands at least for some time, if not throughout all summer. Sadly, not me. When people ask me what my summer plans are, I have no concrete answer. I do not know where I will end up. But one thing is for sure: not my home, not Burma (or Myanmar, a name given by the junta that I do not use).No beautiful thing really comes to my mind when I try to describe Burma, except that it is a prime example of an authoritarian regime scholars famously like to document in their books. It holds one of the worst human rights violation records, over five decades of military dictatorship and nearly eight decades of civil wars. There was a short period of so-called democratic transition of a mere ten years from 2010 to 2020, only to be under military rule again through the recent 2021 coup.The recent coup has turned Burma into a nearly failed state. Today, one US dollar equals 4600 Kyats (our currency) — although the junta-controlled central bank announced it only as around 2100 Kyats, and foreign websites somehow like to believe it. While the currency has plunged, the average minimum wage remains around 6800 Kyats daily, merely under 1.5 dollars!Internet freedom is severely limited, scoring the same 9/100 points as China in the 2024 Freedom House Report. There are frequent internet shutdowns. People cannot use social media applications without a (Virtual Private Network (VPN), and even VPNs have been blocked. Electricity access is also severely limited. Some residents in Mandalay, my hometown and the second largest city in Burma, say that they now get only under one hour of electricity daily. People in conflict-affected areas are constantly displaced to avoid escalating armed conflicts, executions and aerial bombings: 2.6 million people have been displaced near the end of 2023.The most severe displacement crisis came in February 2024 when the military began enforcing mandatory conscription to the military for young people against their will. Young people are abducted for a short period of military training and then sent to the front line to serve as human shields in the fight against revolutionary forces. To escape this, young people have been leaving the country in any way possible, either legally or illegally. Knowing this, the military further tightened control, and today, young people cannot ever leave the country without permission from the military conscription recruitment units. Therefore, those who are already outside of the country can never dare to return because if they do, it is never guaranteed that they will retain their freedom or even remain alive.In addition to the threat of military conscription, political activists and freedom fighters actively working for the revolution suffer from even more severe persecution. They have been brutally targeted, jailed, tortured and executed, leading them to be forced to flee to either abroad or liberated zones where ethnic armed forces control. Any resistance act against the military regime, regardless of the impact, can face up to the death penalty. So, their fate of not being able to return home was more sealed and profound than that of regular citizens.And that was the case for me.Standing up for what I believe came at my personal expense, and I was forced to make a choice. And I have willingly made a choice that made my life miserable but my moral soul free of guilt and full of pride.It has been two long years since I left Burma alone, away from my family and friends. I do not know when I can possibly ever return, but surely, it will only be after the fall of the military regime. And I sincerely hope it will be very soon. I still want to see and cherish my 86-year-old grandparents again before something possibly happens to them. If I cannot manage to do so, then that will be the biggest price I will have to pay for my activism.I cannot go back to my homeland, but to be fair, there is one backup place I can always return to, and that will always welcome me. Thailand: my second home, a land separated only a river from Burma, and where I lived for one and a half years before coming to the States.I have a very close emotional connection to Thailand, particularly Maesot, the Thai-Burma border town that hosts tens of thousands of Burmese refugees and exiled activists. So, I feel this is where my people are, where my community is. Home away from Home.I have lived in Maesot by myself and taught Burmese youth refugees English and Math skills for their higher education. My students are angels. Whenever I am sad, they always cheer me up and lovingly say I could always visit and stay with them if I have nowhere else to go.Yeah, maybe that’s what I will do. Maybe we can all even go together to the not-so-far Thai-Burma friendship bridge over the Thaungyin River, not to cross, but just to breathe the air and admire the landscape from the other side, where our real home lies. So close, yet so far.I wish that someday I no longer need to go back to Thailand for my summers but instead to Burma and instead to Mandalay, my beautiful hometown.I wish that someday, we can happily live in our land again with the freedom, dignity and prosperity that we all deserve.Myat Theingi is a Trinity first-year from Burma.

Let’s bring back the comedy movie,Alex Berkman,2025-01-28T11:00:00Z,Jan,28,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/bring-back-comedy-movies-20250128.html,"Good afternoon.Today we gather to celebrate the life of an extraordinary individual. We also mourn a tragic loss. One of my earliest friends, you have provided us all with bountiful memories and boatloads of laughs. From my first high school party in “Superbad,” to Las Vegas for a bachelor’s trip in “The Hangover,” to the San Diego newsroom with Ron Burgundy, to even an obscure White Castle location with Harold and Kumar, we have certainly had our good times. However, these past 10 years were far from smooth or easy. I know I, myself, would not have had the strength to carry on, to endure even a fraction of what you have endured. To help the audience better understand all that you have been through, I will provide a brief recount of your illness.July 11, 2016: “Ghostbusters” is re-released, this time with an all-female cast. You express anger for the first time. “Who the hell thought that was a good idea!”, along with a slew of misogynistic remarks that will not be named.December 25, 2018: A once dynastic duo in Will Ferrel and John C. Reiley flop mightily in “Holmes and Watson.” Your sickness worsens, as anger turns to longing and sadness. “My babies, my sweet babies — from Stepbrothers and Talladega Nights to this nonsense? Oh, what have I become?”And the most noteworthy event of 2020: your beloved Adam Sandler stoops to all-time lows in “Hubie Halloween,” a decision that ultimately prompts his conversion to a drama actor.“Drama kid? We used to make fun of those guys.”“The world must really be crumbling.”Increasingly, you watched as your former protégés turned to more serious roles, forgetting the men and women they once were, forgetting the joy they could elicit among an audience of strangers: Apart from Adam Sandler, there was Jonah Hill, Jim Carrey, Melissa McCarthy and Seth Rogan (though his career shift may be more attributed to THC than anything). Despite this, you remained hopeful for a full recovery. In fact, you told me about a therapeutic — a miracle drug you said, although likely a long shot (no, not Ivermectin). However, I was skeptical when you noted that the treatment consisted of Eddie Murphy starring in two Netflix cash-grab remakes.Regrettably I was correct, with the release of “Coming 2 America” and “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” only worsening your prognosis.I can now admit that even a toddler could have predicted the failure of said drug. After all, the remake is never funnier than the original.Then on Sept. 23, 2024, Collider published this list of the best comedy films of the 2020s — an opportunity for reflection on your past four years. This list is as follows: 15. “No Hard Feelings” 14. “Another Round” 13. “Emma” 12. “Hit Man” 11. “Palm Springs” 10. “The Menu” 9. “Poor Things”8. “Licorice Pizza”7. “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery”6. “Triangle of Sadness”5. “The Holdovers”4. “The Banshees of Inisherin”3. “Barbie”2. “American Fiction”1. “Everything Everywhere All at Once” And it was on this date, that your strength finally gave out. You looked up at me, lying in your bedstead. Your ailing voice, vaporizing into the hospice air with every exhale. And I will never forget what you told me. You told me that you could no longer recognize the person looking back at you in your reflection. Then, your eyes came to a final close. And just like that, you were gone forever.Well, for about five seconds. Then, you were awoken, in what the doctor referred to as “terminal lucidity,” and you began reciting movie quotes at an almost frenetic pace. ""This one time, at band camp …” (“American Pie”). “60 percent of the time it works every time” (“Anchorman”) “You’re killin' me smalls” (“The Sandlot”)“That’s what I call high-quality H2O” (“The Waterboy”). “It’s just a flesh wound."" (“Monty Python and the Holy Grail”)“There’s so much room for activities!” (“Step Brothers”). “This isn’t the real Caesar's Palace, is it?” (“The Hangover”).""Yeah, baby!"" (“Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery”)But after the emphatic last line, your eyes closed — this time for good.And with it, I could finally bode farewell to you, the comedy genre. We are forever grateful for all that you have given us. ~~~~~~As we now exit this period of mourning and enter one of reflection, let us ask how we got here. Simply put, we stopped creating true comedies — films designed solely to make people laugh. And the stats back it up. In 2008, comedies made up 21% of the total U.S. box office market share; in 2024, this was down to 10%. But beyond that, on Collider’s ranking of the top comedies of the 2020s, there is only one true comedy on the entire list — “No Hard Feelings” — and it’s ranked fifteenth. “Hit Man” (12) is an action; “The Menu” (10) is a horror; “Glass Onion” (7) is a mystery; “The Holdovers” (5) is a drama. And while “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (1) is undeniably a phenomenal film, “comedy” would probably be the fifth or sixth genre I’d associate with it. Honestly, if I had laughed during any of these films in the theater, I would have attracted more glares than if I were to scream “fire” at the top of my lungs. Now, comedy has not ceased to exist altogether, though it certainly has evolved. On the TV front, sitcoms that feature absurd or outlandish humor have taken a back seat to dark comedies and well-developed satires like “The White Lotus,” “BoJack Horseman” and “Succession.” Meanwhile, stand-up is perhaps as popular as it has ever been, with Netflix handing out “Comedy Special” deals to just about anyone with a pulse. However, somewhere along the way — amidst this renaissance in TV and stand-up — the “true comedy” movie was forgotten. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Chris Rock speculated the reason behind the decline, proclaiming that “Everybody’s scared to make a move … Comedy is about exposing things, but now you can’t say anything without it turning into a career-ending event.” There is certainly weight to this argument, with many actors having also spoken up about how they likely would not have been able to recreate their previous works in today's climate. From a studio producer's perspective, more than ever, comedy must be carefully crafted to be both funny and sincere while also avoiding offense at all cost. This has likely curtailed producers from taking risks, while encouraging skillful, comedic writers to take their talents to other avenues where greater creative liberties are afforded and where the bar for what is considered “acceptable” humor is lowered (e.g. stand-up comedy). But comedy movies are distinct from other mediums of comedy. For one, they serve as a reflection of the era they were produced in. For example, “Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986)” captures the carefree nature of the 80s, “Anchorman” resonated with the 2000s' love for absurd humor and quotable lines. And, in 15-20 years, our children too will note that the movies of the 2020s encapsulate just how humorless and overly politically correct our era is. But it does not have to be this way. Listen, we can all appreciate living in a time where we strive to treat everyone with dignity. But we can accomplish this and maintain our moral clarity while still fostering an environment where edgy —and yes, occasionally offensive humor — can thrive. The two are not mutually exclusive. And yet, it seems that we have forgotten that comedy movies do more to unite than to divide, oftentimes transcending the identity of its audience. That is, you don't have to be a man or woman, white or black, straight or gay to find the food poisoning scene in “Bridesmaids” absolutely hilarious or McLovin, a Hawaiian organ donor with no apparent last name, an undeniably classic bit from “Superbad.” Moreover, comedy movies serve to provide an escape when times are difficult or stressful. From personal experience, they were one of my main sources of joy during lockdown. Sure, they had my parents wanting to lobotomize me due to my constant reciting of Will Ferrell lines, but we moved past that, and here I am now. Beyond that, while all forms of humor aim to bring joy, comedy movies have a unique ability to deliver insightful, well-developed, thought-provoking stories — whether it’s about a group of high schoolers getting drunk or, even better, a group of frat bros getting drunk. Simply put, the sheer scale, complexity, and performances of a comedy movie are on an entirely different level from a stand-up routine, TV episode, and certainly a TikTok or Instagram Reel. And thus, they have the potential to evoke deeper emotions and greater joy in their audiences … that is, if they are done right. It is for all these reasons that I say that a world where comedy movies are thriving is a better world — certainly one I’d prefer to live in. So hopefully in a few years we may meet again, where I shall deliver yet another laborious sermon — this time not to mourn the death but rather to celebrate the rebirth of the comedy genre.`Alex Berkman is a Trinity junior.

"A man, a plan, a canal, America?",Leo Goldberg,2025-01-28T11:00:00Z,Jan,28,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/man-plan-canal-america-20250128.html,"The line “A Man, A Plan, A Canal, Panama!” is one of the most famous palindromes ever created, and manages to combine simple wordplay with complex history. Invented in 1948 by the British palindromist Leigh Mercer, the phrase refers to the early 20th century venture by the United States to link the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans by building a canal through the Panamanian isthmus, and remarkably summarizes one of the most important events of America’s departure from isolationism.The “man” mentioned in the palindrome is likely Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president of the United States, who supervised the herculean effort to construct the canal during its initial years. The massive infrastructure project officially established an American presence and involvement in the affairs of Panama, a precedent of intervention that would come to be repeated in Latin America for many decades. Not until 1999, almost 100 years after its construction, was the canal finally transferred to Panamanian control, resoundingly closing the lengthy disagreement over its ownership.As of last month, however, the matter was dramatically reopened when President Trump declared his intention to seize the Panama Canal for the U.S. Frantically ranting about America being“ripped off” by “exorbitant ” commerce fees and losing economic influence over the canal to China, he floated the idea of using US military force to reclaim the canal, jolting the international community who were alarmed by this blatant display of aggression. Panama is not the only country whose sovereignty has bizarrely been threatened by Trump. The president has also expressed interest in acquiring Greenland through military and economic coercion, and annexing Canada as the 51st addition to the United States (It may be wise, if only as the most reliable means of discouraging him from this jingoistic performance, to make Mr. Trump aware that annexing Canada would significantly harm the chances of the Republican Party to win future national elections, as this would essentially be adding a second California to the electoral mix.) While Trump’s annexationist agenda extends beyond just Panama, his desire to acquire the Panama Canal has a special kind of significance. It reveals an underlying foreign policy attitude that the United States has taken towards Latin America for more than a century, one which treats the sovereignty of Latin American countries as a malleable force to be shaped around its own interests.The imperialist overtones of Trump’s desires on the Panama canal trace back to the 1904 Roosevelt Corollary, which essentially stated that the United States had the authority to intervene in the internal affairs of any Latin American country it deemed acted in a delinquent manner, a conveniently open criteria which included acts that “loosened the ties of civilized society.” The corollary served as the ideological basis for America’s continued involvement in building the Panama Canal. This involvement, as one can surely imagine, was not always pretty.The U.S. officially gained the right to build the Panama Canal in 1903 with the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty, which, crucially, required that Panama surrender control of 5 miles of land on either side of the canal to the U.S., an area which the United States ran as a sovereign nation. Within this area, America created a highly segregated apartheid state which created entire cities and communities strictly for American workers in order to prevent contact with Panamanians. A racial hierarchy of workers was established, constituted by “gold roll” workers, which consisted of exclusively white laborers, and “silver roll,” laborers, consisting primarily of black migrants from the West Indies. Naturally, the silver roll workers were the ones condemned to the most perilous tasks and depraved working conditions, and resulted in the vast majority of construction deaths (contrary to Trump’s crazed fabrications that 38,000 Americans died building the canal, and therefore we deserve to own it. The real number is around 300 out of 5,600, the rest were primarily black workers from the West Indies).Furthermore, the canal zone was depopulated of Panamanians, as thousands of natives were forced from their homes. Entire villages and towns of natives were erased, evicting residents who had lived in the area for generations. It is against this history that Trump claims the United States should once again be responsible for governing the Panama Canal for its own benefit. When it comes to relations with Latin America, the United States has historically viewed the region as its personal playground, granting itself the right to intervene economically and militarily in its own “backyard” wherever it deems appropriate. This self-bestowed prerogative which defined American foreign policy towards its Southern neighbors for most of the 20th century was invariably carried out at the expense of the sovereign rights of Latin American states, and it is this kind of profound, historically tainted arrogance that is most striking about Mr. Trump’s threats on the Panama Canal.To forcibly acquire the Panama Canal through military aggression would mark a revival of American imperialism in Latin America, adding to an already lengthy and established record of shady, back-door political transplants. It is past time for the United States to treat Latin America with the dignity and respect it deserves, which includes upholding the region’s unimpeachable right to free sovereignty. Whether it's in our class discussions or our consumption of news media, we as Duke students should keep Panama in mind, and uphold its right to remain free.Leo Goldberg is a Trinity first-year.

Embrace contradiction: Owning unique experiences in the face of their commonality,Samantha George,2025-01-27T11:00:00Z,Jan,27,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/embrace-contradiction-unique-experience-20250127.html,"“One of the mixed blessings of being twenty and twenty-one and even twenty-three is the conviction that nothing like this, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, has ever happened to anyone before.” - Joan DidionThe Duke University Marine Lab is a special place. Certain aspects of its exceptionality are more obvious — who wouldn’t marvel at a college campus located on its own island or classes held on a boat? But, since coming back to main campus, I’ve struggled to fully capture what my semester at the lab felt like then or means to me now, whenever the inevitable question arises. Part of this struggle is surely due to the immensity of the experience. I spent 18 weeks living on the coast with 10 other Duke undergraduates; we spent our days watching dolphins from classroom windows, running experiments in the lab and competing in many impromptu knock-out tournaments, most commonly in flip-flops or sandals. We jumped off the swim dock and watched sunsets, and we held parties featuring the broken karaoke machine, which functioned as our ground-dwelling disco ball. For an entire semester, we were, practically, within arm’s reach of each other, sharing in our triumphs and tribulations. So, it’s hard to sum up the ups and downs, all the little memories and laughter, in a few sentences in a passing conversation. It seems to betray the experience, to belittle it, to cast it aside in such a way. But there’s more to the struggle than a worry of lacking detail or falsely representing the experience. I know how I feel about my time at the marine lab. I have clear impressions of its joy and contentment. Why then do I find myself hemming and hawing when asked about my semester away?Part of this hesitation, surely, comes down to the silent, humbling pressure that whispers, “You’re not that special.” With over 3,000 Duke students having studied abroad in some capacity just in 2024, my self-awareness catches in my throat and makes me hesitate to share, fully, what the semester meant to me. My experience is my own, but it’s also one in a million of other, similar experiences. Afraid of facing the eye roll and falling into the category of being one of those people claiming “transformation” from their semester abroad, I often choose to downplay the experience. I’ll say that it was good, perhaps share an anecdote or two, but not fully expose its profundity and power.And here is where my good friend, writer Joan Didion, enters the scene. In her essay “Goodbye to All That,” Didion shares her musings on endings and beginnings, particularly during the sensitivity of one’s early twenties. She acknowledges the dissonance one can weather with experiences that we believe are original, but remain fairly common. But she pushes on the idea that this knowledge isn’t, and perhaps shouldn’t, be enough to prevent such convictions from growing. She gives us room to be hypocritical in this way; to act a certain way, believe certain things, to commit to them fully and openly, while still being aware of the possibility, and probability, of them not being as unique as we may think.Despite knowing that there are other people doing it better, doing it earlier, doing it in a different way that is beating my same way, I can’t help but feel that my marine lab experience was truly my own: uniquely and authentically me. The troubles I navigated, the relationships I built, the appreciation for the fiery sky on every evening walk, it has to be all mine. And why can’t it? Why shouldn’t it? There isn’t harm in embracing my own narrative for a bit, because if I don’t, who will?And so, to my fellow juniors returning to campus from their time away, but also to anyone guarding a transformative experience, I urge you to share in it fully. Revel in the experiences that have made you who you are, especially those shared with people with whom you love and care. Don’t let the evidence of being a single face in a crowd of many stop you from embracing your own narrative. Like Joan Didion said, that contradiction is part of the beauty of being young and in your twenties, so walk the line proudly. Sit in WU and laugh over the fun details from your trips and travels, the overused jokes, the forgotten memories, and bask in knowing that the one thing that makes your experience one in a million is that it’s all yours.Samantha George is a Trinity junior.

Here’s your diploma,Anna Garziera,2025-01-26T11:00:00Z,Jan,26,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/heres-your-diploma-20250126.html,"I sometimes recall those good old days in high school when after the beginning of classes, there was a two-week period where the teacher introduced the class topics and then reviewed material from the year prior. The most they might have had us do was an icebreaker.Not here at Duke. FDOC came and we were already running. That same night, I had four assignments on my to-do list. How is it that I’m already behind?Yesterday, I was doing schoolwork all day. For one of my classes, I read a scientific paper by Damon Clark and Paco Martorell on “The Signaling Value of a High School Diploma.” The authors found that for Texas high school students who take the exit exam, passing the test and actually earning a diploma has no significant signaling value in the labor market. This finding is significant because it contradicts Spence’s signaling theory that individuals with private information (such as their willingness to work) can send signals to employers to make their “true value” known (such as earning a prestigious diploma) to overcome information asymmetry.In conducting this study, Clark and Martorell wanted to address the question that has upset some human capital proponents for the past fifty years: Does the added value of education come from receiving a diploma in the end? After all, the authors argue, “a diploma is essentially a piece of paper and, hence, by itself cannot affect productivity.”Confronted by this question, I started thinking. Am I here at Duke just for the piece of paper I’ll get at the end? What is the value of a Duke education?If President Price offered me a chance to be done with all of this and get my diploma tomorrow, would I take it?A Duke bachelor's degree costs the average student $198,427, which the college advisory website College Factual doesn’t think is great value for money. But does our “big name” make it worth it? Is our experience sufficiently unique?The average Duke student takes advantage of their undergraduate experience. We have the opportunity to go abroad through Duke-In programs, participate in DukeEngage and tent for the Duke-UNC basketball game. And a lot of us do all three.When talking with older adults, we are often told to enjoy these years, for they are among the best in our lives. Duke Physics majors would beg to differ. Spending every night cooped up in office hours or the research lab gets old fast. Even after zooming out further to include the whole semester, spotted with a few games and the occasional care-free weekend, is the toil worth the diploma? Yet, a lot of Duke experiences have little to do with receiving a diploma in the end. From hosting dorm parties, to climbing the Duke Chapel, to paying a visit to the Duke Lemur Center, these are the experiences that we’ll end up remembering throughout our lives.The human brain may be wired so that we have an easier time recalling “the good parts” of an experience. The worse parts, we tend to remember more vaguely and think about less. And this quirk is not reserved for women in labor. Even after living in the U.K. for more than six years, I still remember more sunny days than rainy ones. Trust me — the odds would not fall in that favor. It was cloudy nearly 90% of the time. This would imply that even if each semester feels overwhelming in the moment, we’ll think back on it fondly. But we could even brush friendships and cool memories aside. As future earners, what we really care about is whether ploughing through four years at Duke promises us a higher paycheck.So, forget the social, emotional and intrinsic value of a Duke education. What is a degree from Duke worth in monetary terms? And does this worth come from our increased productivity, or from a “piece of paper” certifying that we have made it through?I think the answer to that question varies from student to student. As our teachers sometimes like to remind us, each one of us was chosen to be here. Whether for our grades, extracurriculars or stellar personal essays, the admissions office looked at each one of our resumes and thought us worthwhile.That is to say, each of us has the potential to get something out of these four dreary years. Whether that looks like challenging ourselves with taking six classes every semester, joining the executive board of a sports club or making a new friend every day, we might each do something that we wouldn’t have dared do a couple of years ago.The returns on this exercise could be extraordinary. Our college career could then improve not only our productivity but also our social skills, fluency, independence and leadership — none of which we can develop through merely attending a few lecture-style classes.But there’s also a different route. We could suppress our ambition and take the easier path. We could declare a less demanding major and glide along with four classes each semester. We could be rolling around in our free time like kids in a ball pit. That’s the normal college route, one which would more closely resemble President Price’s approaching you with a neat diploma, handing it to you and saying, “Here’s your diploma. You may go now, if you’d like.”One way or the other, these four years will blow by us quickly. Whether as a gentle breeze or as a snowstorm, we’re free to pick ourselves. But choose wisely. The right path might not be the easy one.Picture yourself ten years from now, in your big-shot corner office. You have a view of the city and a comfortable spinny chair. You glance at your shiny Duke diploma, framed in mahogany, hanging behind your desk. You smile, conscious of the fact that if your paycheck is bigger because of it — you have certainly earned it.Anna Garziera is a Trinity sophomore. Her pieces typically run on alternate Sundays."
Rekindling hope: Finding a path forward amidst destruction,Aaron Siegle,2025-01-24T11:00:00Z,Jan,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/rekindling-hope-20250124.html,"The Los Angeles (LA) sky dawned clear and beautiful on the morning of Jan. 7. Few expected that a day beginning with a blue sky would end in one of the most devastating wildfires in the region’s history.But this is our reality. 2024 was the first year that global temperatures rose 1.55 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, exceeding the Paris Agreement’s goal to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The chaparral ecosystem of Southern California has always been fire-prone. In fact, chaparral needs fire to regenerate by enhancing plant germination. But the recent fires are not normal fires. An extremely dry “wet season,” exacerbated by climate change, orchestrated the perfect storm of conditions that ignited these destructive fires.Beyond the rising temperatures and low precipitation in the LA Basin, other factors were at play that led to the fire. The Santa Ana Winds, which are a result of both pressure and elevation differences between the LA Basin and the Great Basin further inland, resulted in gusts exceeding 100 mph that fanned the flames and grounded firefighting aircraft. The winds are concentrated into a few narrow passes in the San Gabriel Mountains, allowing embers and debris to rapidly spread. Wet conditions in LA over the last two years allowed for vegetation to proliferate, adding fuel to this year’s dry spell. This perfect combination of ideal fire conditions is the real reason behind the severity of the LA wildfires.The real question is not whether the LA wildfires were caused by climate change. The real question is, where do we go from here?Hurricane Helene ($250 billion in damages), Hurricane Milton ($34 billion), Cyclone Chido ($675 to $831 million) and the flooding in Europe (close to $14 billion), are just a few of the natural disasters our world has experienced over the last year. Each climate-related disaster is often examined individually. But when viewed as a whole, a pattern of increasingly severe disasters emerges. Instead of treating each event as an anomaly, we need to ""climate-proof"" our communities, building adaptation networks that expect the unexpected. In 2024, Congress allocated an extra $20 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) disaster relief fund, which simply addresses disaster response, not future resilience. As the scale of disasters expands, we need to look beyond immediate recovery and towards broader preparedness for chronic threats.The proximity of both the Palisades and Eaton fires to Hollywood and the densely packed LA metro area has given the disaster outsized attention. But, devastating as they are, these fires are no longer unusual. The Lahaina Fire (2023, 17,000 acres burned, 101 dead), the Camp Fire (2018, 153,336 acres burned, 85 dead), the Tubbs Fire (2017, 36,807 acres burned, 22 dead) and the Woolsey Fire (2018, 96,949 acres burned, 3 dead) all briefly captured media attention before quickly falling out of the public consciousness. “Environmental stories don’t break, they ooze,” said journalist Frank Allen. But fires, with their fast-moving and catastrophic nature, seem to be an exception to this rule. And yet they still struggle to garner significant public attention after they lose the status of ‘breaking news.”This absence of collective memory is indicative of a broad decline in attention span in our modern society. We are constantly overloaded with a never-ending stream of information, leaving us little headspace to grapple with the profundity of these disasters. The communities impacted by the aforementioned fires are still being rebuilt — long after they have been forgotten. This societal amnesia isn’t just a PR problem. It prevents us from learning from the past and adapting to these chronic threats. In the wake of the destructive fire seasons of 2017 and 2018, the California State Legislature considered a bill that would restrict the construction of homes in areas at very high risk of fire. But the bill failed to pass after an extensive lobbying campaign against it by the real estate industry. People want to live close to natural areas — where the fire risk is the highest — and memories of this fire will soon be glossed over by images of stunning vistas of the Pacific Ocean.The fires also magnified stark inequalities when it comes to disaster resilience. While the homes of everyday citizens burned, billionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso called on his squadron of private firefighters to protect his home and real estate interests. Even for those whose homes emerged unscathed, there will still be costs to bear. In just one example, a recent visit to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), I learned that 25-30% of electricity rate hikes were a result of wildfire mitigation. While resilience is a worthwhile endeavor, its costs are distributed unequally. When a new, usually upscale, house is built in a fire-prone area, a utility must build and maintain transmission to higher standards to limit the possibility of fire. However, the costs to upkeep these expensive power lines are billed equally across all customers, which is especially difficult for low-income residents, whose utility bills make up a larger percentage of their expenses.After tragedies, many public officials make promises that such events will never happen again. However, the response to the LA fires has been different. “I don’t have the ability to make this not happen again,” said LA Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone. He’s right — while firefighting agencies will get most of the heat and scrutiny in the coming days, the ability to stop such ferocious fires is out of their control. Only long-term policy changes that adequately account for fire risk will make a difference. Duke has made advances in this field through the Duke RESILE program, a new research initiative that uses data science to quantify climate risk. Catastrophe modeling can help better educate insurers, homeowners and policymakers about the wildfire risk of a neighborhood.The status quo is not sustainable. We cannot wait for emissions reductions to occur and climate change to relent. Policymakers must enact greater restrictions on construction in fire-prone areas. Firebreaks, open spaces filled with managed vegetation, can ring developed areas to protect them from fires. Paradise, a town completely destroyed by the 2018 Camp Fire, is building a large firebreak around the town to protect against future fires. Prescribed burns, which mimic natural fire ecology by reducing overgrown vegetation and invasive species, are needed to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire. The unprecedented attention given to the LA fires provides a brief window to implement long-lasting reforms.More natural disasters are inevitable, but there are still big questions that are up to us to answer. Will the desires of the ultrarich continue to be prioritized over the well-being of the whole community? Will more resources be devoted towards long-term resilience activities? Will neighborhoods receive the support they need after the headlines have moved on? The answer is up to us.Aaron Seigle is a Trinity junior. His pieces typically run on alternate Fridays."
"It’s all an act, really",Ashlei Tomlinson,2025-01-24T11:00:00Z,Jan,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/its-all-an-act-20250124.html,"At Duke, it is easy to become lost in a room where many compete to be the loudest or most astute. Not only do you feel relegated to the corners of the class, but you may lose out on the essence of a lecture or, in my case, the beauty of Pádraig Ó Tuama’s poetry last semester inside Duke Chapel. It had been some time since I sat in a church, but the familiarity of that November evening last semester did not escape me. Before me, as always, sat a beloved speaker and a willing audience. Promising to embrace me, too, were breathtaking words of guilt and affirmation. But this was no regular church service: it was a public conversation and poetry reading by Pádraig Ó Tuama.The reading attracted hundreds of guests, filling the Chapel’s many pews. Such demand was not unusual for Ó Tuama, considering the popularity of his ""Poetry Unbound"" podcast and the acclaim of his poetry. Seeing the Chapel filled, however, was strange. I had never seen devotion spill over itself so openly that people would stack themselves for a glimpse at wisdom. Ó Tuama, it would seem, inspired such worship.Left and right, I saw a sea of believers nodding their heads and humming their assent. Their meditation soon pulled me in, bringing me to also nod and hum. For what exactly? I am not quite sure. His words, to me, were white noise drowned out by the sea of humming. They were beautiful words, I imagine, the same as I suspect Beowulf is spectacular even though I have not read it. It occurs to me now, though, that since I had not heard him, others, especially those around me, must have also not heard him. Yet their gestures were, by far, the most insistent.Two middle-aged men, clad in tweed jackets and elbow patches, particularly come to mind. They sat in the pew directly in front of me, nodding and humming in unison, riding the wave of the Chapel. After a while, they began to comment as well, small anecdotes here and there, one man always following the next. When they were not commenting, they were leaning forward, again, one after another. It seemed terribly convenient that each man would express rapture in the same manner and timing. I suppose they could have been so in tune with each other that such mirroring was natural. Looking around me, though, it appeared that others, too, were walking that line between engagement and effrontery.Admittedly, there was no shortage of genuine awe that evening. Ó Tuama was spellbinding, even for me, who hardly caught every word. Amid Ó Tuama’s oeuvre, however, was a battle of the cultured: supposed poetry enthusiasts, vying, no matter what, to be the most enthused. But was this so surprising? This was Duke after all: home of the bloviator.At Duke, education often seems performative. Most students, if not all, vie to be the best among the best. In every casual reunion or chat before class, there is the student who ""abashedly"" announces they are taking organic chemistry, only to be topped by someone who is not only taken ""orgo"" but multiple courses like it, and that one to be topped by someone whose major or track is unbelievably hard (insert BME, pre-med, pre-law, etc.). Ask those students, however, one material thing about those classes or disciplines, and very few have a ready answer. That is not to say they do not know the material, but that their knowledge is immaterial to education. It matters more to effect higher learning than to embody it. Many at Duke seem to have perfected this ensemble. And, like the poetry goers, compete in their performance of knowledge. But what happens to those who have not? Those who feel morally opposed to or, more likely, too shy to act the expert? To the women in S.T.E.M. classes who feel they have no voice in male-dominated fields? They fall behind. They become the silent spectator in a Chapel of poetry savants, mimicking those around them to — someway, somehow — not feel left out.Ashlei Tomlinson is a Trinity first-year."
One more minute: Romanticizing the wonder of being,Annie Ming Kowalik,2025-01-21T11:00:00Z,Jan,21,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/one-more-minute-20250121.html,"Sometimes, I like to imagine that I have left this world forever — that I have died. Now I know this sounds awfully morbid, but hear me out.In those moments, I picture myself wishing desperately for just one more minute to experience the wonder of being alive. To walk to class under a brilliant bluebird sky. To have the privilege of wrestling with a stubborn math problem. To feel the weight of my books pressing into my shoulders as I catch the C1 across campus. To run and run and run until my lungs ache. To grab an impromptu dinner with a friend, to swim in the ocean, to read just one more book. To laugh until I can't breathe and cry until the world feels like it’s ending — just one more time.In the midst of these stressful current events, I’ve found myself captivated by the simple beauties of life. The vine that sprouts, defiant, from a cracked pavement. The sound of my sister’s voice over the phone, crossing the world just to make me smile. How lucky am I to have a schedule that keeps me busy! How lucky are we to learn something new every day, to have things to be nervous about, to dream of and work on towards a future we’ve been able to choose!I recently came across a quote: ""There is somebody in a hospital, and it’s their last day on earth. They’re wishing they had the same amount of time you do.: As a student from a university with fewer resources devoted to student experience — something I’ve explored in earlier articles — this resonates deeply. It reminds me how much I’ve gained during my time here, and how important it is to fully embrace the opportunities around us, especially in this post-election period.At Duke, we’re privileged to have so much within our reach. How many universities can boast a lemur center, an art museum, terrace gardens and over 1,300 acres of land just on the main campus to explore? I talk to anyone, and the chances seem to spin themselves out of thin air into delectable possibilities.Isn’t it exhilarating to know that through the Duke Aviators you could get your pilot's license — or at the very least take an intro flight. Or that through the Duke Conservation Society you might have a chance — as I did last weekend – to experience the stunning natural beauty and genuine impact being made on preserving our natural environment at the Marine Lab down in Beaufort? These are just two of the heaping multitudes of wonder which are offered up to us on a Duke-sized plate!Can we acknowledge how lucky it is to just be able to attend talks on governmental lobbying with Pulitzer prize-winning journalists? Or even just to have lunch with your fascinating professor — a luxury not often afforded overseas.Romanticize the little things: sitting in the Gothic Reading Room at Perkins, seeing sunlight percolating through wooden beams and imagining oneself the protagonist of some dramatic novel. I cannot help but delight in everything. I urge with a childish wonder that we do not delay because we ""could do it next week,"" because that’s how time escapes us.You’re alive and you’re here. That fact in itself is the combination of uncountable unlikely probabilities. Call that friend. Hit the gym. Climb a mountain. Explore the world, and in doing so, find more of yourself.

"Duke professor to launch new academic TikTok, GPAs expected to hit record highs",Monday Monday,2025-01-20T11:00:00Z,Jan,20,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-professor-launch-new-academic-tiktok-20250120.html,"Editor's note: The article below is satire.The Supreme Court upheld the ban on the wildly popular social media video app TikTok this past Friday. Their decision came as a shock, causing students to panic about the loss of their primary source of educational content. The ban, prompted by accusations of the Chinese government spying on American users, conveniently became the top trending headline the day before our historic inauguration. At least America has its priorities straight.Seeing an opportunity to save Duke's TikTok-educated masses, British-born Computer Science Professor J. Bailey submitted a grant proposal one hour before the app was banned and secured funding to start on an experimental app. This new app would combine academia with TikTok. Students spend more time on TikTok than studying for their exams, so why not combine the two?Professor Bailey reckoned he'd enhance the app's features instead of tossing out what makes it ""properly smashing."" He promises that part of the new app will embody the spirit of TikTok by combining Facebook gossip, complaining tweens and infinite poor decision recaps after a night out. However, instead of the high usage time of TikTok dragging down GPAs, Professor Bailey says the new app will encourage even more hours of screen time, as each video must include an educational component, which will undoubtedly have students flocking to the new version. To unlock the app, the top-level security measure requires users to answer ten multiplication problems in under ten seconds. If locked out, students will be redirected to Khan Academy.Out with the pointless choreographed dance videos and in with the Crazies assessing the chemicals in the blue body paint! Users can do anything from dancing to listening to snippets of a recorded lecture to reenacting the signing of the U.S. Constitution in the Gothic Reading Room. Students will tag their academically enhanced videos as #TaughtMeMoreThanMyTextbook, #StressedAndBlessed, #KhanAcademyKickout and #MyOnlyHomeworkIsThisVideo.The app's success has other departments clamoring to join what Bailey calls ""The Educational Revolution 2.0."" The math department chair, tired of students calling calculus ""too boring,"" demanded all theorems be explained through rap battles. He claims that its integration by parts just ""hits different"" when it's put to a beat. The economics department also wanted in and is advocating for a special video filter to explain the difference between ""margin"" and ""markup."" A select group of students, the ""WU Crew,"" first made famous as scouts for Duke’s underground sports gambling ring, are the only students who've seen the app’s blueprint. Their main concern is the app’s ban on celebrity content, leading to students boycotting his new app. Bailey's solution: British celebrities only. The approved list includes E. Watson, H. Golding, N. Galitzine and his favorite, S. Ashley. Students can appeal to add other U.K.-based celebrities through a formal petition requiring a thesis on why their chosen celebrity embodies at least three academic disciplines.The CS 490 development course will be available to the student TikTok users who average the most weekly minutes. He hopes to have a class that spends around 10 hours a day on TikTok, but he will settle for those who average eight. The class will be graded based on how many total views they get and if students have perfected a British accent by the end of the semester. Some top names he threw around were ChapelTok, SarahPDukeGardensTok, DukeCentennialTok or simply BritTok.Monday Monday would like to say that when Professor Bailey was informed that TikTok had been reinstated 14 hours after it was banned, he threw his 10,000-page research proposal off the Chapel and screamed, “Bloody ‘ell!”"
Stranger danger? A lesson from Howard Thurman on King Day,Luke A. Powery,2025-01-20T11:00:00Z,Jan,20,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/lesson-from-howard-thurman-king-day-20250120.html,"The Rev. Howard Thurman, an ordained Baptist minister, was named one of the twelve most important religious leaders in the United States in 1953 by Lifemagazine. Ebonymagazine called him one of the fifty most important figures in African American history. He advised civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., James Farmer and Pauli Murray. He served as a dean of university chapels (at Howard University and Boston University), taught as a university professor and wrote numerous books about the spiritual life. He even preached at Duke Chapel in 1979!He was a sage who influenced the thought and life of King, whose father was Thurman’s college roommate at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. Many of the themes you hear in King's work — love, justice and community, for example — are also found in Thurman’s writings.On this King Day, there is one lesson from Thurman’s life that may be enlightening at a time in history when there appears to be pervasive estrangement among the citizens of the United States. When there may be a perception that every stranger is a danger and thus should be dominated or destroyed, there are two scenarios from Thurman’s life that reveal another way forward. Both are found in his autobiography, ""With Head and Heart."" He begins this book by telling the story of when he was an assistant to the pastor at First Baptist Church of Roanoke after his first year in seminary. He was 24 years old and felt an ""ambivalence"" about his life and calling at the time. But while the church’s pastor, Dr. James, was on vacation, he was thrust into a situation in which a dying man needed pastoral care. On his first night on duty alone, the head nurse of a local hospital called the parsonage looking for Dr. James, but he was away. The nurse asked Thurman, ""Are you a minister?"" because the dying man was looking for a minister. Despite his hesitancy, Thurman replied, ""Yes, I am a minister."" Thurman was unsure how to handle this situation because he was inexperienced. He knew he should pray in some way, though he grasped for the right words in that moment. After he prayed with the man, the man thanked him, and Thurman said, ""He died with his hand in mine.""The man on his dying bed did not know Thurman, but at his point of need, he turned to a stranger for support. There was no danger, only human care and compassion, and literally a human touch. The image of the hands of strangers touching each other reveals how we are to be bound to one another in our mortality. In this story, Thurman was a stranger to the dying man, and he offered help.Another story in the book shows how a stranger helps Thurman in the time of his need. When Thurman was only 14 years old, he left the comforts of home to pursue further education at a boarding school in Jacksonville, Florida, since there was no high school for Black children in his hometown of Daytona Beach. When he arrived at the train station to make his trip to Jacksonville, he was shocked to learn that while he had enough money for the fare, he needed more money to check his trunk. Thurman thought his great opportunity would be taken away from him on that platform until an ""anonymous stranger"" approached him and asked him why he was crying. This stranger gave him the money he needed to get to Jacksonville, changing the trajectory of Thurman’s life. After he gave him the money, he walked away, and Thurman never saw him again. Thurman never forgot that act of kindness. It made such an imprint on him that he dedicated his autobiography, not to a well-known theologian or businessman or celebrity or family member, but to this stranger on the platform who ""restored his broken dreams."" This stranger was not a danger to Thurman but rather his saving grace.Humans don’t have to be estranged from one another but can recognize our need for each other and the bond of common human flesh and blood. Often in crises, we see that humans embrace compassion, despite differences that divide, and offer support. This resists our tendencies toward tribalism. Tribes can be tyrannical and terroristic such that anything or anyone not in our tribe is viewed as inferior or feared as a stranger. But Thurman, reflecting ancient scriptural wisdom, demonstrated a life that encountered and welcomed strangers with the knowledge that he might be entertaining angels by doing so. He knew that it might take a stranger to restore a broken dream.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel. His column runs on alternate Mondays."
What Duke (and universities like it) can get wrong about civil dialogue,Alice Qin,2025-01-14T11:00:00Z,Jan,14,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-can-get-civil-dialogue-wrong-20250114.html,"The past election has only further invigorated a national discussion on the ways in which higher education shapes civil and political discourse writ large. At a superficial level, reporters and writers have noted a supposed ""college-degree divide"" or ""diploma divide."" The predominance of liberal thinking on campuses — one that is also documented at Duke — has also been criticized. Given increasing conversations surrounding the disconnect between liberal elites and ordinary Americans, certain commentators — like David Brooks and David Blight — have interpreted this election result as an indication that something needs to change within so-called ""elite"" institutions of higher education. In some ways, Duke was ahead of the curve in addressing these issues. In light of a supposed decline in civil discourse and worsening political polarization, Duke made several pointed, marked efforts to promote civil dialogue last year. The Office of the Provost has spearheaded severalinitiatives, and other on-campus projects are occurring both within and outside the classroom. These efforts, along with other similar programs at differentuniversities across the country, are valuable investments in academic curricula and campus life. However, I would like to illustrate one crucial pitfall that Duke — and potentially other universities like it — can easily fall into when approaching the issue of civil dialogue. Namely, facilitating effective civil discourse is ultimately very different from facilitating knowledge production — a distinction that universities like Duke may overlook.Before delving into this issue, I’d like to point out a few points of context. Firstly, Duke (as well as other universities) are first and foremost institutions of knowledge production — which is performed in a ""scholarly, critical and impartial way."" As a field, academia is deeplyhierarchical — to produce knowledge, some people must be the experts of the experts who serve as arbiters for the discipline. Secondly, Duke (and other universities like it) are not governed as democratic institutions. Sure, some bodies, like the Academic Council, are composed of faculty members who vote on policy proposals in meetings. But 24 of the 36 seats on the Board of Trustees are elected by the existing Board of Trustees themselves, with only the remaining 12 elected by the graduates of the University. The bureaucratic juggernaut that is the ""college administration"" is largely a highly hierarchical institution with a top-down chain of command.Therefore, Duke (as an institution of higher education) and civil dialogue (as a democratic enterprise) are arguably placed in contradictory, not complementary, positions. Sure, universities can certainly serve as a platform for ideas to be openly exchanged, and studies have also demonstrated the democratizing effect of education. Yet, when institutions of higher education themselves are largely composed of non-democratic structures, a lot couldpotentiallygosideways.To reconcile that tension, I’ve observed that Duke has developed a tendency to approach civil dialogue the same way it approaches knowledge production. The Provost’s Initiative on the Middle East, for instance, ""strive[s] to model thoughtful and civil engagement, [to] provide a forum for different perspectives on the conflict, [to] enhance understanding based on expertise and evidence-based scholarship, and [to support] others at Duke who are striving to do the same through their own activities."" There’s nothing inherently wrong with this type of engagement — scholarly, critical and impartial examination of these issues is arguably necessary. But there’s a deeper emotional component to civil dialogue that this intellectualized form of engagement lacks and sometimes even overshadows.Intentionally or not, many of Duke’s events promoting civil dialogue often present it in what I think of as a form of ""armchair"" discourse. By ""armchair,"" I’m not suggesting that the scholars participating don’t know what they’re talking about. Rather, under this image, civil dialogue is often conceived to be a mostly (if not purely) intellectual enterprise. Quite literally, what we see in many university-sponsored events — convened in the name of civil dialogue — involve an invited expert and a facilitator speaking to one another while sitting in armchairs. Sometimes this conversation comes in the form of a keynote lecture. In those events, students commonly sit as passive participants, listening quietly to experts talking — and, if they’re lucky, their only chance to speak is to ask a question during the Q&A section. This is not to say that more direct engagement from students doesn’t exist on campus. Even so, thinking of civil dialogue primarily under the terms of knowledge production predisposes us to focus on purging ""bad"" or ""messy"" elements from what is perceived to be “good” discourse. Just like isolating an independent variable from confounding factors, this approach tries to keep discourse clean, poised and streamlined. Extra attention begins to fall onto what is an appropriate mode of communication, and how to control the environment of which speech is expressed — a surface-level conception of ""civility"" that centers behavioral components of speech just as much as its contents. One type of ""bad"" element, for example, can be disruption. As the University Faculty Handbook states, ""A determination to discourage conduct that is disruptive and disorderly does not threaten academic freedom; it is, rather, a necessary condition of its very existence."" One can make a reasonable argument that disruptive and disorderly conduct can certainly constrain academic freedom. However, though I’m not a historian, it only takes a couple of Google searches to find numerous examples of how disruptive forms of protest have driven numeroussocialmovements. And, many of those forms of disruption were practiced on college campuses. Yes, disruptive forms of protest are not inherently justified — but it’s hard to make the case that they should not, under any circumstances, be understood as valid forms of expression. ""Constructive conversation"" should not be simply conceived as two people sitting in armchairs talking to one another. When it comes to the most divisive issues of our lifetimes, we need to confront deeply emotional, and sometimes traumatic, things. The way those experiences are unpacked and expressed as free speech, especially in the public sphere, is not always going to be polite or calm, nor similar to how we would conduct a typical classroom. Believe it or not, it is not easy to simply ""respect differing viewpoints"" if you feel that the different ""viewpoint"" in question has real implications for your life (or others). Ultimately, civil discourse and dialogue is not, in its essence, about knowledge production. Knowledge production is about being right, which usually involves putting personal biases aside to pursue objectivity. Civil dialogue is about being understood, which requires putting our personal experiences at the forefront of the conversation. No matter how ""right"" experts end up being, it’s an entirely different project to make people feel that they are understood. As David Brooks cited in his essay, ""69 percent [of Americans] believe that the 'political and economic elite don’t care about hard-working people,' [and] 63 percent think experts don’t understand their lives.""It is important to emphasize a set of additive, rather than subtractive, questions. Instead of asking how we can get rid of ""nasty"" elements of civil discourse today, we should ask, how can we facilitate sustainable, campus-wide forms of relationship- and community-building among individuals from divergent backgrounds? How do we do so in an increasingly unequal, socially siloed and structurally segregated American society — issues that persist across and within higher education institutions? Crucially, can Duke come to accept that this will forever remain a messy, complicated process that they can never fully tame?Rather than focusing on how to restrict, arbitrate and constrain spaces of discourse in the name of civility, we need to put more of our effort into bridging, building and creating them — while centering students. This should be the Duke way.

Duke Athletics to change 2025-2026 Duke men's basketball tenting entry test for UNC game,Monday Monday,2025-01-13T11:00:00Z,Jan,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-athletics-change-tenting-test-monday-monday-20250113.html,"Editor's note: The article below is satire.A recent poll of the student body has Duke Athletics in a frenzy, as it showed 90% of students felt the tenting test focused too much on basketball-related knowledge. Many cited the entry test as not ""accessible"" to the masses. They argue that it is used to punish the non-basketball-fan students who only want to attend this one game. Duke Athletics administrators assured these students not to worry, as the tests in the last several years have already become more obscure with social media posts and sponsorship deals, steering clear of actual basketball information about the Blue Devil hoops team. Half of last year’s test was replaced with pop culture questions, but it wasn’t enough. Duke Athletics will now take full control to ensure the 2025-2026 test will have even less sports content.Many complaining students' current lack of knowledge has ranged from thinking the AP Poll refers to how many advanced classes they took in high school to not understanding that ""field goal"" does not mean that a football kicker will take the court. An administrator said they couldn’t risk basketball knowledge being a barrier to university interest by asking questions about statistics or game history either.Over the weekend, the University's President and the head of Duke Athletics reflected on how the 2024-2025 tenting test is heading in the right direction. They were happy when they saw the question about the hottest player's prom date's dress color from 2019, claiming that this helps lay the foundation for what topics future K-Ville tenters can expect. It was blue, in case you were wondering.For the new tests in January 2026 and beyond, Duke Athletics hopes to add categories such as players' eye colors, astrological charts and 20-character childhood Wi-Fi passwords. They are also adamant about keeping current wholesome content going, such as the overly invasive personal life questions that are asked about the players. However, after some protests, the head of Duke Athletics caved and allowed other administrators to offer an option for the fans who actually care about the game of basketball and the history of Duke men's basketball. These administrators argued that they couldn't completely alienate the 10% of students who were basketball fans who went to games all season. This led to a solution of adding three more K-Ville tents for these ""men's basketball enthusiasts.""Students who feel that they can demonstrate their extensive Duke men's basketball knowledge can choose to take a special version of the tenting test. The top 36 students will qualify for one of these three tents. The only catch is these basketball-intelligent fans have to agree to be pushed into the back corner of the student section if they want into the game. In a related story, it is rumored that Duke Athletics turned down Nike’s offer to make a three-story tent for the 36 superfans. Finally, to the new Class of 2029 (congratulations, by the way!!), some of the players for the 2025-2026 season have already committed, so it's never too early to start studying!Monday Monday would like to say sorry in advance to other tenters if this author just ""poked the bear"" before the second test.

Although I only met her once during her Chinese grading assistant interview, she left a lasting impression as a kind, polite and thoughtful individual. Our email conversations further reflected her professionalism and warm personality.My heartfelt condolences go out to her family, friends, and all who knew her. Jiani’s presence will be greatly missed, and her memory will remain in the hearts of those she touched.听闻佳妮的离世，我深感悲痛。虽然我仅在她参加中文助教面试时与她见过一次，但她给我留下了深刻的印象，她彬彬有礼，友善且周到。在我们的后续邮件交流中，佳妮的文字和语言也展现了她的专业素养和温暖的个性。我向她的家人，朋友以及所有认识她的人致以最深切的慰问。佳妮的存在将令人无比怀念，她的记忆将永存于被她触动过的心灵之中。Tianshu He/贺天舒, Senior Lecturer of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.~~~~~In memory of Jiani Yu: A reflection on an extraordinary life I am Shen Chen. I began my visiting scholar program at Duke University’s Department of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies (AMES) in August 2023. Through academic and cultural activities at AMES, as well as in various professors’ classrooms, I met Jiani (Thea). This May, an opportunity to interview her allowed me to connect more deeply with her and understand her better. Jiani's extraordinary experiences and stories deeply moved me. After interviewing her, I wrote the following passage, expressing my emotions, respect, and blessings: “After interviewing Thea, my emotions remained unsettled for a long time. ‘My youth was three times as long as others’ might capture some traces of Thea’s life. During her middle school years, Thea moved with her parents from a small town in China to the U.S., where she ended up in a ‘crummy high school’ before making it to college, only to discover that enjoying video games and studying them professionally were entirely different matters. After obtaining her undergraduate degree, she worked as a restaurant server, delivered for Uber and even planned to become a long- haul truck driver, all because it paid relatively better. Thea experienced the rapid maturation required of children in immigrant families, taking on the responsibility of caring for her parents. Her rich yet struggle-filled life moved me to tears and filled me with admiration for her. I believe her efforts and growth will surely light the way for many young people striving upwards! I sincerely wish for Thea’s path ahead to be even brighter, more composed and happier!” It was these unique experiences that endowed Jiani with a depth, maturity and empathy not commonly found among her peers during her humanities research at Duke University. Her interview series, titled “Unyielding Perseverance through Acceptance, Facing, and Adapting to Circumstances,” included six episodes and received much positive feedback. Her story touched and inspired many viewers. Learning of Jiani’s passing deeply saddened me. Looking back at her photos, I often feel she has not left us; it’s as if she is still here, joining in our gatherings and conversations. In discussions with her parents and other family members, we all deeply felt Jiani’s strong wish to be understood and seen. May our remembrance transform into a deeper understanding and seeing of her. May Jiani rest in peace! 纪念佳妮: 对一个非凡生命的追思我是陈蔘。我于 2023 年 8 月开始在杜克大学亚洲与中东研究系(AMES)开始我的访学项目。在 AMES 的学术与文化活动中，以及不同教授的课堂上，我认识了佳妮 (Thea)。今年 5 月，由于访谈的契机，我与她有了更深入的接触，对她有了更多的了解。 佳妮非同寻常的经历和故事深深打动了我。在访谈她之后，我写下了这样一段文字，表达我 的感动、敬意与祝福: “访谈 Thea 之后，我的心情久久不能平静。‘我的青春有别人三个那么长’，也许能捕捉到 Thea 生活的一些轨迹。初中时，Thea 随父母从中国小镇移民到美国，她在口中的‘破烂高中’考上 大学，却发现喜欢打游戏和将游戏作为专业是完全不同的概念。本科毕业后，她做过餐馆服 务员，送过 Uber 外卖，还曾计划做长途卡车司机，只因为这个职业的收入相对较高。Thea 经历了移民家庭孩子快速成长，肩负家庭重担的艰辛，她丰富又充满挣扎的人生经历让我感动，落泪，也让我对她充满敬意。我相信，她的奋斗与成长经历一定能照亮更多努力向上生 长的年轻人!衷心祝愿 Thea 接下来的人生道路更美好、更从容、更幸福!” 也正是这些独特的经历，让佳妮在杜克大学从事人文研究时，拥有了许多同龄人未必具备的 深刻、成熟与同理心。她的访谈视频共 6 期，我们取名为“自强不息的随遇而安”。访谈播 出后获得了许多积极的反馈，她的故事感动并鼓舞了许多人。 得知佳妮离世的消息，我感到万分难过。回看她过往的照片，我常常觉得她并没有离开，仿佛依然在我们身边，和我们一起聚会、聊天。在与她的父母及其他家人交流时，我们都深深感受到，佳妮渴望被理解、被看见。愿我们对她的怀念，化作对她更多的理解和看见。愿佳妮安息!

How the Grinch is stealing our voting rights ,Katherine Gallagher,2024-12-23T11:00:00Z,Dec,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/grinch-is-stealing-our-voting-rights-20241223.html,"I thought I did everything right. I’ve lived in North Carolina my whole life and the day I got my driver’s license, I was so excited to register to vote — a milestone that felt like a rite of passage into adulthood and civic responsibility.Since then, I’ve stayed informed and active in my democracy. During a summer working at the General Assembly, I saw firsthand the persistent efforts to undermine voting rights in our state. I joined the Student Voting Rights Lab this year to study the impact of these policies on the youth vote. I learned their tactics, and I knew my vote was a target. This year, I took every precaution to ensure my vote would be counted. Mindful of the risk of putting down my dorm address on my voter registration form and not being verified, I made sure to register with my mailing address. I brought two forms of identification to the polls — my North Carolina driver’s license and my Duke ID. I voted early at Karsh to verify my registration and prevent any issues. I tracked my ballot status daily on the Board of Elections website, until I finally saw the word “ACCEPTED” appear next to my vote.I knew the risks. I followed the rules. And yet, my vote is still being called into question. I found out my ballot was being challenged the same way one comes across an insurance scam — through an unassuming, arbitrary postcard sent by the North Carolina Republican Party. Analysis by the Student Voting Rights Lab at Duke displaying challenge rate by county in North Carolina.This postcard was sent to me and more than 60,000 other voters, whose ballots are at risk of being discounted due to State Supreme Court candidate Jefferson Griffin’s challenge to overturn the election results — a candidate who has already lost in two recounts. The challenge claims I did not list the last four digits of my social security card on my registration form, that my form is “incomplete,” and that my voting rights are therefore disposable. But after reviewing my registration with the Board of Elections, I can confirm my form was filled out correctly — this challenge is completely baseless.I'm just one of many voters at risk of disenfranchisement. The Voting Rights Lab identified 492 Duke students on the list of challenged voters. We ran voter registrations from precincts 05, 02, and 07 through the internal Duke directory, labeling Duke voters accordingly. We then cross-referenced the list of registered Duke voters in those precincts with the challenged voter list. As seen in the image below, the precincts with the highest challenge rates are concentrated around Duke, whereas other high-population precincts in the outskirts of the county experience significantly lower challenge rates.Analysis by the Student Voting Rights Lab at Duke.Analysis by the Student Voting Rights Lab at Duke.The challenge claims these voters did not provide a North Carolina driver’s license or the last four digits of their Social Security number during registration. Analysis by the Voting Rights Lab reveals the challenge disproportionately targets young voters, potentially silencing progressive voices to flip the election for Griffin, who trails by 734 votes. This insidious effort exploits students’ absence during the holidays, leaving them unaware of critical mail and at risk of being disenfranchised without their knowledge.Data sourced from Board of Elections public voter registration records, analyzed by the Voting Rights Lab.Data sourced from Board of Elections public voter registration records, analyzed by the Voting Rights Lab.Citizens with allegedly “incomplete voter registrations” should not be blamed for inconsistencies in election administration by the North Carolina Board of Elections. Missing database information often stems from discrepancies between DMV and Social Security records, such as differences in maiden and married names. The responsibility for an incomplete database lies with administrators, not voters. This challenge is not about election integrity — but about silencing student voters in order to flip the outcome. We cannot let them get away with this. If you see your name on the list, I encourage you to take action. Protecting our democracy is a gift we can give to ourselves and future generations.

What the trans-exclusionary story about sport gets wrong,Joseph Hiller,2024-12-13T17:00:00Z,Dec,13,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/trans-exclusionary-story-about-sport-gets-wrong-20241213.html,"Republicans have become the party of anti-trans agitation. Throughout the 2024 campaign, their ads demonized trans participation in public life. Their wedge issue of choice? A distorted view of women’s sport. Trump led the way. He voiced lies about transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and about a San Jose State volleyball player who may have been outed as transgender by her teammate. His rancor didn’t stop at transgender athletes: He spread hateful misinformation about nontrans Olympic boxer Imane Khelif, too. Even though Democrats did little to challenge transphobic Republican talking points, some commentators now argue that supporting transgender and gender nonconforming athletes is a mistake. This is the wrong conclusion. The weaponized obsession with policing women’s sports is new — it is manufactured, it is spiteful and it should be disarmed. Republicans have exploited rhetoric about restricting women’s sport, but they did not invent it. They join a reactionary chorus of current and former athletes, academics and athletes’ parents. We must reject the trans-exclusionary story these figures peddle about women and sport. It hurts trans, intersex and gender nonconforming people and it deflects attention away from the issues that do threaten women and girls in athletics. There is every reason to foster alliances — not enmity — between all women athletes, in the interest of combatting gender-based injustice in the sports world and beyond (Just listen to Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe).Sex is not common senseWhat do I mean by the trans-exclusionary story? We can start close to home. Thomas L. Perkins Distinguished Professor of Law Doriane Coleman is prominent in the movement to restrict women’s sport according to a binary interpretation of the category “sex.” She has written a book about the topic, “On Sex and Gender: A Commonsense Approach,” as well as numerous op-eds and articles. In 2019 she testified to congress. She is a frequent podcast guest. Unpacking the problems with her thinking can help us understand what is misguided and hurtful about this narrative. The core of Coleman’s argument, as she presents it in this work, is that “the basic facts [of sex and gender] are universal and timeless.” For her, sex is “dimorphic,” immutable and easy to determine. Gender is separate from sex; not all women are female. And because of innate sex-based performance inferiorities, in the world of competitive sport, it is only fair for females to compete against other females. This is why she believes that transgender women and women with intersex conditions threaten “extraordinary harm.” Their participation in elite sport, she asserts, sacrifices competitors with a “female’s body” as “collateral damage” and it is “bad for women and girls when we pretend otherwise.” The problem with this story begins with the meaning of sex. As historians of science like Beans Velocci and Jules Gill-Peterson and biological anthropologists like Alexandra Kralick show, sex is not such a simple thing. Is sex fixed before birth, or at puberty, or can it change? What matters in determining sex: genitalia, hormones, chromosomes, internal organs, reproductive capacity, appearance or bones? “The more scientists have studied sex,” Velocci argues, “the more contradictions the category has come to contain.” Coleman’s work does not reckon with this complexity. She describes her work as “sex smart,” yet fails to engage with research that challenges “common sense” beliefs. One consequence is the undercount of people born with intersex traits, people whose bodies don’t fit tidily in categories of male and female. In the sports context, these people are often described as having “disorders of sexual development” (DSD).In her book, Coleman claims that the incidence of people with intersex conditions is “truly tiny,” “only about 0.02 percent of humans.” The source for this is a bit muddled, but the nearest citation is of an advocacy group called Intersex Human Rights Australia (IHRA). IHRA staunchly argues that “the actual numbers of people with intersex variations are likely to be as much as 1.7 percent,” 85 times higher than what Coleman asserts. Coleman admits that her numbers are “contested by some,” and that “it’s been suggested … that 1.7 percent (not 0.02 percent) [of humans] are exceptional.” But she fails to substantively engage the arguments of scholars who advance the higher percentage, and she dismisses the reasons why IHRA advocates for the higher number as a “philosophical gambit.” On fairness in sportWhen human bodies defy binary sex — as many do — sport governing organizations inevitably run into difficulties policing the female/not female line. One solution is to trust people when they say who they are. We could listen to Olympic gold medalist Caster Semenya, for example, who explains that although she has been diagnosed with an intersex condition because of how her “internal organs are structured,” she is a woman and “an elite female athlete.”The borders of “female” are subjective because sex as a category is not coherent. Transgender athletes also challenge efforts to segregate sports by sex. Gender-affirming treatments bring about complex bodily changes, exposing how chromosomes are not destiny. And further, trans perspectives illuminate how categories of sex and gender are anything but neutral descriptions of reality — they are ideological and historical technologies of population management. What does this mean for fairness? Coleman insists that there is a “biologically driven performance gap between males and females” and so people who have experienced the “constructive effects of the Y chromosome and male puberty” cannot fairly compete against people who haven’t. The evidence is more dubious. Athleticism can’t be reduced solely to quantifiable factors like testosterone. Every athlete’s body is a patchwork of genetic capacities — some are boons, others handicaps. Many of these qualities have nothing to do with sex, and indeed, women may have underrecognized advantages in some events. As such, there is ample disagreement about how to foster “meaningful competition” in women’s sport.It bears repeating that including transgender women and women with DSD in women’s sports is not the same as including men. Case studies show that transgender athletes encounter “very complex athletic advantages and disadvantages … when they switch teams.” When it comes to athletes with DSD, some scientists argue “we simply don’t have enough data” to assume unfair advantage.Meanwhile, fairness is about more than biology. Bodies don’t compete in “some socially-neutral vacuum.” Athletes targeted for supposed deviation from femaleness face harassment, threats and violations of their privacy. Many nontrans women — especially women of color and queer women — are accused of being transgender because they do not conform to restrictive gender norms. The suspicious posture that Coleman models will only lead to more attacks on women athletes.Honest reckoning with gender and sports performance must look beyond the individual bodies of competitors. It must be realistic about how trans-exclusionary arguments give cover for anti-trans hostility. A failure of empathyColeman does sometimes lay out a more nuanced case for exclusion and inclusion. In “On Sex and Gender,” she distinguishes between policies for competitive and non-competitive sport, and she has been publicly critical of blanket bans on transgender athletes. But a drawback to Coleman’s inclusiveness is that the kinds of accommodations she argues are necessary to allow transgender girls to compete “when prizes, podiums, championships, and records are at stake” — namely hormone therapy — are becoming less accessible to trans youth across the country. Pragmatically, then, Coleman continues to argue for banning transgender youth from the parts of sport that, elsewhere, she positions as fundamental to sport’s value: a chance to win at the top level, to do more than “try out for the team and go home with a participation ribbon.”Coleman argues that if transgender women or women with DSD succeed, “female” athletes will be “robbed” of “the opportunities to be role models for little girls who need to see strong, victorious females so that they can dream big dreams themselves.” Why is it so obvious that girls would reject being inspired by transgender champions like CeCé Telfer or Lia Thomas? These are awesome women athletes. And what about little transgender girls (and boys), or girls with DSD? Have they no right to witness people like them succeeding, and to succeed themselves? This is a failure of empathy that defines the trans-exclusionary position. It goes deeper: Coleman positions transgender and intersex women as threats, but she waves off the threats these communities face. Take her discussion of bathrooms and locker rooms. In “On Sex and Gender,” Coleman cites a U.N. report to argue that it makes sense for “females” to be wary about “male sexual violence in places where they go to relieve themselves.” This report makes no claims that transgender women are a threat to other women in bathrooms. (Empirically, such claims are baseless.) While she has stated that she supports transgender women utilizing women’s bathrooms, Coleman insists that “we need to respect” the fears that some other people may hold that transgender women in women’s bathrooms and locker rooms threaten women’s “physical safety and privacy interests,” that these fears are “protective instincts” we should not dismiss. Who do these instincts protect? Trans people routinely face violence when trying to use the bathroom – the notion that they are a danger is part of what endangers them. Justifying anxieties about imagined bathroom assaults is inconsistent with Coleman’s claims that she’s “an ally to trans people.” It is irresponsible to adopt positions that impact trans people without considering what community trans organizations tell you about that advocacy. The trans-exclusionary story ignores the real harms women athletes face Unlike the craven legislators who draw upon her work, I believe Professor Coleman cares deeply about women’s sport. But I also think she has made herself available, using the prestige of the institution for which we both work, to nefarious forces that would see trans people disappear. Sport continues to be a cornerstone of escalating anti-trans legislation. Duke administrators should be clear-eyed about the trans-exclusionary impacts of these positions. It does not have to be this way. The policies that Coleman advocates target a “vanishingly short” list of athletes – transgender athletes are in fact “underrepresented.” Like sports scientist Joanna Harper, I believe we “should try to find some method that maximizes the possibility that all women can enjoy equitable and meaningful sport.” The obstacles to this vision are not transgender women or women with DSD. The preoccupation with restricting the category “female” ignores the serious, structural and intersectional patterns of sexist harm that impact huge numbers of women and girls. Trans and nontrans women athletes both face gender-based violence. They confront sexual coercion and harassment, constrained economic opportunities, rigid gender norms, inadequate legal protections. The disregard, complicity and cruelty of sporting authorities. Femicide. These are the forces that menace women athletes. Anti-trans policies do nothing to address them. Instead, these policies weaken what could be the grounds of robust, coalitional anti-violence organizing. The trans-exclusionary story undercuts what is beautiful and joyous about sport, replacing potential allyship with anger and resentment.

A love letter to Duke fitness classes: Rediscovering the joy of movement,Valentina Garbelotto,2024-12-12T17:00:00Z,Dec,12,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/love-letter-to-duke-fitness-classes-20241212.html,"When I first got to college, one of the things I was secretly thrilled about was leaving gym class behind. No more mandatory laps, dodgeball games or mile runs that felt like a public shaming ritual. Finally, freedom from fitness I didn’t enjoy, but somehow, I found myself working out still. I’d walk miles to class, lug a too-heavy backpack around campus and take the stairs to my third-floor dorm room in Southgate religiously. Then during freshman year, I realized my routine was missing something: the gym. I wasn’t looking to “get in shape” or achieve some fitness goal; I just wanted to feel good in my body again. I wanted to take control and exercise in a way that made my time feel meaningful. But every time I thought about walking into the gym, I hesitated. I wasn’t a “gym girly” or even the kind of person who enjoyed exercise. That just wasn’t who I was. But after coming back from my first winter break, a friend and I decided to brave a Saturday morning yoga class in Brodie Gym. It felt surprisingly good to get up early and start the weekend off with a sense of accomplishment. So, one class turned into a weekly endeavor. By the time the semester was over, I knew I wanted to continue exercising. Yet, I wasn’t sure I had the intrinsic motivation to frequent the gym on my own time or if yoga was really my thing (or just a convenient way to start moving). Still, yoga was the only exercise I felt brave enough to continue, so I decided to stick with it. When class registration for sophomore year arrived, I decided to give Yoga Level 2 a shot. It being a class on my transcript was motivation enough for me to roll out of bed twice a week. Yet by Thanksgiving break, I had used up almost all of my unexcused absences and I wasn’t sure I liked yoga anymore. I loved my instructor, but the clock seemed to tick slower and louder every class until we reached our 9:45 a.m. dismissal. My mind would drift to my laundry or pending deadlines and I’d forget to breathe through the poses. I felt like a fraud for even bothering to show up when I wasn't in the present moment. By December, I needed a break from yoga, and since I’d taken the advanced-level course, it was a great excuse to switch to something different. So, I found myself in Pilates Level 1 the following semester. It was mentally challenging. I didn’t know anyone in the class and I didn’t enjoy the exertion of the exercises. But I didn’t know any better. I just thought everyone felt that way about exercising. It was something to push through, a task meant to be endured.For many of us, exercising has often felt like a chore on a never-ending to-do list: We drag ourselves to the gym, go through the motions or find creative ways to avoid it altogether. Working out often feels like a means to an end, focused on physical outcomes rather than enjoyment.For me, my mom’s lingering voice in my head saying “Don’t forget to exercise” was my number-one motivator — I was only doing it to make her proud of my ""productive routine.” That all changed when I enrolled in Fusion Fitness for Women.And boy, am I glad I did. This class has been about so much more than combining cardio and weightlifting. We hiked the Al Buehler Trail, explored Duke Gardens and Wilson’s functional fitness space, tried step aerobics, got creative with a Halloween-themed workout and ended the semester by climbing Wilson’s rock wall. When we ventured to the weight room, I found that it wasn’t as scary as I realized. Yes, everyone looks like they know what they’re doing, and that can be so intimidating, but with my instructor Maria Finnegan there, I went in knowing I had someone who’d answer my questions without judgment. Class never felt like a chore. Instead, I looked forward to peeping at the syllabus and seeing what surprise Maria had in store for us next.Through this class, I’ve discovered an amazing group of girls and learned the styles of fitness that work for me. The best part? The supportive environment allowed me to be fully present in the moment and find enjoyment in the process. Goodbye, step aerobics — thanks for helping me realize how uncoordinated I am. Hello, weight room, I deserve to grunt in there too. (Cycling, I’m coming for you next.)I’ve learned that exercise can be a shared experience that forges connections. After every class, my friends and I would head to Red Mango for our well-deserved acai bowls (that sometimes got me through grueling workouts). As I've worked out with others and taken notes on what I've learned throughout this class, I've gained the confidence I needed to go to the weight room by myself — and even tackle new machines while I'm at it. Another bonus of taking a class is the built-in accountability without the pressure of rigidity. I'm often so busy, I put off going to the gym at all, but having a carved time in my schedule where I have to go allows me to workout regularly. You also get six unexcused absences, meaning you can still prioritize other parts of life when needed. Fitness classes are truly Duke's hidden gem. They give us a chance to redefine our relationship with exercise. From Aikido to tennis to yoga, these classes encourage us to try new things and push ourselves physically without the pressure of expertise or competition. It’s not about being the strongest or the fastest but about showing up, trying something different and realizing that exercise can be enjoyable and rewarding. Duke’s fitness classes also taught me that fitness is deeply personal. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach, and that’s okay. For some, working out is about building strength or improving speed, and that can be incredibly motivating. But for me, fitness has become less about measurable outcomes and more about exploration. It’s about discovering what brings me joy and makes me feel grateful for my body’s abilities.The beauty of it all is finding what resonates with you. Fitness doesn’t have to be about forcing yourself through something you feel an obligation to complete; it’s about finding what you love and what makes you feel good.These classes haven’t just changed how I feel about exercise in college. They’ve given me the tools and confidence I’ll carry long after graduation. Knowing how to approach a new activity, take up space in a gym (and anywhere else) and listen to your body means you’ll always have the ability to figure out what works for you, no matter where life takes you. Ultimately, fitness doesn’t need fancy equipment or the perfect “gym.” You can use your dorm-room carpet as a makeshift yoga mat or a scarf as a stretch band, but all you really need is you.If you’d told me as a freshman that I’d one day look forward to working out, I wouldn’t have believed you. But these classes have shown me that fitness doesn’t have to be about pushing through something you hate or striving for an ideal you don’t care about. It can be about movement that feels exhilarating, activities that spark joy and environments that encourage growth. Fitness isn’t something I dread anymore, and it doesn’t have to be that for you either. Don't endure your workouts — enjoy them. I promise it's much better that way.Valentina Garbelotto is a Trinity junior. Her column, “Dear comfort zone: It’s not me, it’s you. Time to break up…”, typically runs on alternate Thursdays."
Reflections on the greatest war criminal in American history,Leo Goldberg,2024-12-11T13:00:00Z,Dec,11,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/greatest-war-criminal-american-history-20241211.html,"November 29th marked the one-year anniversary of the death of Henry Kissinger, a man regarded by many to be one of the shrewdest diplomatic minds of the 20th century. Indeed, there has hardly been an individual in American history whose influence over US foreign policy and global affairs was so complete, and whose expertise was as coveted and revered. Simultaneously, there has hardly been an American with as much blood on his hands, and whose exclusive quantity of human rights abuses rivals the world’s worst despots and tyrants. Kissinger, who served as the Secretary of State and National Security Advisor under the Nixon and Ford administrations, was responsible for manufacturing an American foreign policy of ruthless pragmatism in which the lives of civilians were a price gladly worth paying for the sake of US geopolitical advantage. His realpolitik, when it came to conducting diplomacy, was responsible for the deaths of millions of innocent people, and his extensive record of human rights violations was enough to lock him up for many lifetimes. But the distinguished position he held in the American political elite, and the reliable immunity that US citizenship often grants the worst criminals, ensured that he would never have to answer for his appalling crimes. The exhaustive list of Kissinger’s transgressions far exceeds what can be included in this article, but I’ll just list some of the most flagrant:Kissinger was the chief architect of the carpet bombing campaign furtively undertaken by the United States from 1969 to 1973 against the countries of Cambodia and Laos, extending the already disastrous Vietnam War into those countries too. Over the course of those four years, Kissinger personally authorized almost 4,000 bombing raids on Cambodia alone, the targets of which were often densely populated areas. The bombings were done entirely in secret, without the consultation of Congress and in violation of the US Constitution and international law.The lowest estimated casualties are 50,000 in Laos and 150,000 in Cambodia, though many put the true figure in the hundreds of thousands. Furthermore, the instability that was left in its wake allowed for the ruthless Khmer Rouge, led by Pol-Pot, to take power in Cambodia and slaughter a further 2 million people, a quarter of the country’s population. The incessant dropping of pesticides and napalm during this 4 year period destroyed entire ecosystems and perpetuated a health crisis that caused widespread birth defects for hundreds of thousands of children, the effects of which Indochina still reels from today. Staying in the region of Southeast Asia, the tiny nation of East Timor is another victim of Kissinger’s depravity. In 1975, East Timor’s much stronger neighbor, Indonesia, headed by the brutal General Suharto, saw an easy opportunity to exploit the unraveling Portuguese empire, of which East Timor was a part, and launched a military invasion to annex the country. A genocide ensued in which 200,000 Timorese people were slaughtered, an astounding number for such a small nation. Henry Kissinger had met with Suharto in Indonesia the day before the invasion and gave the green light for it to commence. Throughout the military campaign and after, Kissinger, against US law, supplied the Indonesian forces with 90% of its arms.Leaving the region but remaining in Asia, Bangladesh is the next country inflicted with genocide under Kissinger’s watch. In 1971, the leader of Pakistan, General Yahya Khan, deployed armed forces to Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) to quell mass protests against his own electoral corruption. In a move of sordid expediency characteristic of his foreign policy, Kissinger convinced Nixon to support Khan to preserve their convenient alliance with Pakistan and again funneled weapons to Pakistani forces. By the end of the military occupation, the most modest figures estimate that half a million Bengalis were killed, though the real number is likely 2 to 3 million. While the carnage was taking place, the US consul general in Bangladesh, Archer Blood, sent desperate telegrams to Washington reporting the mass murder occurring around him. Kissinger repeatedly ignored them. Entering our own hemisphere, in 1973, Kissinger played an outsized role in engineering a coup against the democratic government of Chile. The election of Salvador Allende, a socialist, as Chile’s president in 1970 was intolerable to Kissinger, and he ensured it was undone. When the commander-in-chief of the Chilean army, René Schneider, refused to use the military to prevent Allende from taking office, Kissinger colluded with the CIA and bribed kidnappers to depose him. Schneider was killed in the kidnapping. When this failed to stop Allende from assuming the presidency, Kissinger again surreptitiously plotted a coup with Nixon and the CIA, which took place in 1973. The coup installed Augusto Pinochet, the leader of the junta which overthrew Allende, as the new leader of Chile, inaugurating a brutal 17-year proto-fascist regime which saw the death, disappearance and torture of thousands of people, including two American citizens. There are many more offenses which could be added to this list. I omitted, for example, Kissinger’s role in Iraq, Angola, Cyprus, Argentina and others for purposes of length. The potential criminal cases against him, if ever brought before an international tribunal, were beyond damning. Kissinger, though, was never tried for his war crimes. Instead, he lived to the age of 99 not only as a free citizen, but an eminent one, whose counsel was lauded by members of the political elite like Hillary Clinton. The complete immunity with which Kissinger was able to dictate his unscrupulous and lethal foreign policy for over 50 years remains a great stain on the American conscience, and exposes a glaring disparity in who ultimately gets prosecuted for war crimes.There exists now in international law a double standard in which the enactment of justice is conditional on the degree of power held by the individual or government accused. Leaders in prominent countries pontificate about upholding human rights and promoting democracy, and use their strength and influence to coerce those who don’t, but happily exempt themselves when it comes to their own offenses. While Kissinger enjoyed a lavish life as a fugitive from justice, retribution was resoundingly delivered to Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Saddam Hussein of Iraq, individuals who should no doubt have faced consequences for their respective crimes against humanity, but whose prosecution was an indication not of their uniquely egregious crimes, but of their lack of significant international power. Today, the enforcement of international law continues to remain partial and ineffective. As I write this, Vladimir Putin is ravaging the country of Ukraine, for which he has his own pending warrant for arrest issued by the ICC, but to which he will almost certainly never have to answer thanks to Russia’s advantageous global position. Last week, the ICC announced an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his role in war crimes committed against the people of Gaza. Again, the move is noble but largely symbolic (not to say belated), as Israel isn’t even a member of the ICC. Meanwhile, of the 54 people the ICC has ever indicted, 47 are African, which can be explained not by a disproportionate violation of human rights on the part of Africa, but by a disproportionate lack of power. While the Rome Statute may have been written with good intentions, its inability to enforce its rulings means that, at best, the apprehension of war criminals relies on global superpowers to impose, and is limited to third-world tyrants.It's a shame that Kissinger was never taken to the Hague and tried for his crimes, and his death cemented with it the death of justice too. The one-year anniversary of his passing should serve as a reckoning for the United States on the permission it gives to figures like Kissinger to get away with the most unimaginable crimes, and the mockery this makes of the profoundly American idea that no one is above the law. If the US hopes to reverse its declining global image and reassert its claim to be an agent for good, it must show the world that it is willing to apply to itself the same righteous principles it demands of others, and will hold accountable American citizens whose crimes require redress. Until then, the very idea of justice, and the inherent concept of its equal application, will continue to hang in the balance. Leo Goldberg is a Trinity first-year."
Beyond red and blue,Jasmine Fan,2024-12-10T13:00:00Z,Dec,10,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/beyond-red-and-blue-20241210.html,"As a poll worker, I encountered hundreds of people during early voting: classmates, friends, some of my professors, Duke students voting for the first time, a young Chilean girl who couldn’t vote but begged to peek inside and a guy who walked in utterly confused and blurted out, “Biden dropped out? When was this?” One voter even marked every bubble on the ballot. (I later explained to him that you could only vote for one presidential candidate.)While working, I couldn’t help but peek at their political affiliation. In fact, I found myself almost unconsciously assuming their political party even before looking up their registrations. My partisan arithmetic went something like this: white guy + mid-60s + Army veteran cap = Republican. Brunette girl + round tortoiseshell glasses + beige cardigan = Democrat. When a young woman in a baby blue Prius pulled into the parking lot, I proceeded with the same mental arithmetic: young woman + baby blue Prius + … Wait — Trump 2024 bumper sticker? That equation didn’t quite add up.My mistake? I was using social identities to predict political ones. And that only goes so far. In reality, many of our identities are arbitrary and, at times, seemingly irrational. As a Duke student, for instance, your unwavering loyalty to Duke basketball and unwarranted hatred of UNC seem instinctive. But what if you had gone to UNC instead? Chances are you’d feel differently.A similar paradox encapsulates many of our other identities. Take sports teams and hometowns, for example. I grew up in the Bay Area. Naturally, I love the Warriors, hate the Lakers and will refute anyone who criticizes San Francisco. But if I had been raised in LA, I’m sure my allegiances would flip completely.While political beliefs aren’t entirely akin, I can’t help but wonder how much of our ideology is shaped by chance, by circumstance. If I had grown up in a different environment with a different family and experiences, would that change the way I vote? It’s highly likely, yes.As Ezra Klein notes in “Why We’re Polarized,” “our partisan identities have merged with our racial, religious, geographic, ideological, and cultural identities.” In “Uncivil Agreement,” Lilliana Mason adds that a “single vote can now indicate a person’s partisan preference as well as his or her religion, race, ethnicity, gender, neighborhood, and favorite grocery store.” While I agree that, in many cases, our social identities do align with — and may influence — our political ones, assuming a neat overlap is an oversimplification. The 2024 election alone proves otherwise: Trump outperformed expectations with key demographics, improving his margins among young voters, women and voters of color as compared to his 2020 campaign. Classifying voters with clear-cut partisan labels misses this nuance. People are not monolithic. I realized this on election night. It was nearing 7 p.m., and voter turnout had slowed. My coworker, Mack, and I sat outside the polling station, waiting for any last-minute voters. He told me about growing up in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, how his father worked on the Manhattan Project and stories from his time stationed in Japan. Once again, I began my mental arithmetic: white man + late-70s + veteran + Tennessee… I glanced at him, wondering if he was making the same calculations for me: 19-year-old girl + California + college student. But instead, to my surprise, he was entirely fixated on the night sky. He turned to me and asked, “Can you tell if the moon is waxing or waning?” My mind went blank. Something about his question — maybe just the sheer simplicity of it — completely caught me off guard. That’s when I stopped calculating. It didn’t matter whether he voted red, blue, green or somewhere in between. I knew I didn’t need an answer to my equation anymore.I once assumed my “math” would always yield the correct result, but now, I realize my equations were not only flawed — they were also myopic. People are so much more colorful than the red and blue boxes I tried to cram them in. My perspective began to shift once I replaced “or” with “and.” If a hyphen between “Asian” and “American” grants me both identities, why do these hyphens start disappearing when it comes to our political identities? What about socially progressive and fiscally conservative voters? Gun-owning, God-fearing Democrats? Baby-blue-Prius-driving Trump supporters? And what about the people who want to vote for every candidate on the ballot? (I’ll make my case for ranked-choice voting on a different day.) We often view identities as contradictory when, in many cases, they are interdependent. Moving beyond the political binary requires acknowledging the “ands” within us. We are all more multifaceted than the two-party system permits.I’ll admit, sometimes, I still slip back into my habitual partisan arithmetic. We all do. It’s almost automatic. In those moments, however, we must remind ourselves that our calculations are mere assumptions — ones that pull us apart from each other. When we calculate, or rather, miscalculate, we assume we already know everything about a person. We overlook their complexities. We dismiss their stories. In the end, we only miss out on one of the most profound interpersonal opportunities — the opportunity to truly understand someone. When I stopped calculating and actually started listening to Mack, something changed. Our shared humanity transcended red and blue binaries. In my mind, we weren’t just a veteran and a college student, a Tennessean and a Californian. We were just two people, heads tilted upward, studying the night sky. The truth is, when the day ends, we are all gazing at the same moon. And perhaps, that is enough commonality. Jasmine Fan is a Trinity sophomore."
"Duke extends winter break through spring, dorms to become Airbnbs",Monday Monday,2024-12-09T13:00:00Z,Dec,9,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/monday-monday-duke-extends-winter-break-20241209.html,"Editor's note: The article below is satire.After receiving countless complaints about the short period between Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks, Duke finally decided to extend this year’s break to March to save students thousands of dollars on tuition and travel costs. It will also give professors more time to procrastinate when posting final grades. However, a close friend from the Housing & Residence Life (HRL) department told me that Duke’s intentions are actually quite sinister. The plan is for HRL to send an email Dec. 16 at 10 a.m. to let students know that regardless of whether they are returning in the spring semester or not, all possessions must be gone by 10 p.m. that night.This is because Duke is turning the potential tuition loss into a money-making machine. They plan to convert all Duke dorms into Airbnbs so that members of the general public can get the ""Duke student experience"" during the winter sports season.Duke isn’t going to change anything within the dorms so that the Airbnbers staying there can truly live like a student: no air conditioning, loud doors and no bathroom soap. The Washington Duke Inn & Golf Club is unhappy about this new idea and wants potential game-goers to know that they have ample soap and quiet doors for the guests. After the Washington Duke Inn fired back, Duke decided to provide all residents with a few essentials. Each room will be equipped with an unclaimed, stained comforter from Duke’s yearly donation bins, a shower caddy, size 14 shower shoes and a roll of single-ply toilet paper in case the bathroom runs out, as Duke’s hardworking maintenance staff will also get paid vacation during the break. The base price for all dorms is $500/night, even if you’re a student who opted in for winter break housing. Though, people assigned to the Bassett dorm get a $100 discount and a $5 meal voucher for having to sleep in the moldy rooms. An exciting perk of this new housing system is that each dorm will have its own unique itinerary, with activities both in its own dorms and throughout campus. Within each dorm, some authentic Duke student activities on the itinerary range from finding stolen batteries for the Kilgo and Craven common room TV remotes to searching for missing common room furniture in nearby dorms. The campus activities will give visiting dorm residents the chance to explore Duke’s world-class dining facilities, academic buildings and sports venues.Ever heard of Disney’s Epcot Park’s ""drinking around the world"" activity? Well, now the Blue Devil Airbnbers can do that at Duke, too! Duke’s dining hall hosts cuisine from around the world: pasta from Italy, various foods from around Asia, Latin American tacos or burritos and many American foods — each with its own special drink. While the Epcot experience specializes in alcoholic drinks, Duke’s ‘drinking around the world beverages’ include SmartWater, Minute Maid apple juice and, if you’re feeling edgy, a zero-sugar Kiwi Strawberry Vitamin Water.If residents are feeling sluggish from the non-alcoholic drinks, they are encouraged to check out the nearby Allen building, home of English majors, where they can catch a nap during a Shakespeare seminar just like a real student. If they’re ready for an adventure, they can even head out to the LSRC building off of Science Drive to check out the room where both the current head men’s basketball coach and yours truly took CS 94, an introductory computer science animation course. I’m still trying to figure out if I got a better grade than him. An optional activity is to pirate a ""Harry Potter"" book online and read it in the Gothic Reading Room, a Hogwarts-esque space perfect for channeling your inner Potterhead. I solemnly swear sometimes the pictures move and whisper ""GTHC"" to hype up the students during midterms. Finally, people can visit most of Duke’s sporting venues at no extra cost. Residents can step into fame by being able to swing a bat on both the Jack Coombs Baseball Field and the Duke Softball Stadium, as both programs won the 2024 ACC Championship. They can also play a match at the Sheffield Indoor Tennis Center and swim a lap in the Taishoff Aquatic Center. However, if they want to visit Cameron Indoor for a meet-and-greet with the men’s and women’s basketball teams, it will cost them an additional $25,000. Stay tuned for more of Duke's shenanigans when I return next semester as your 2025 Monday Monday...Monday Monday would like to be the first to tell prospective residents that for an additional $100,000, they can be spun in the air by the MBB team to recreate the iconic 2019 360-degree dunk."
Beyond the spectacular: Why storytelling matters,Natalia Harnisch,2024-12-06T13:00:00Z,Dec,6,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/beyond-the-spectacular-20241206.html,"Last semester, during Linguistic Justice Week hosted by the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies here at Duke (CLACS), I watched a documentary called “La Mujer de Estrellas y Montañas,” which translates to “The Woman of Stars and Mountains.” It was this spring evening in which I first learned about the story of Rita Quintero — and about the power and impact of storytelling. So, let me begin by telling you about her.Rita Patino Quintero was a Tarahumara indigenous woman from the state of Chihuahua in Mexico. Rita was born on June 15, 1935 and grew up with her tribe in the Sierra Mountains of Chihuahua in a place called Cerocahui. Rita was a restless, free-spirited woman who did not care to confine herself to the rigid implications of a woman’s role in her society at that time — for this she was ostracized. Therefore, finding the courage and motivation to leave, she began traveling around different areas of Chihuahua City and beyond.Eventually she crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and arrived at Johnson City, Kansas, in 1983. She was kept in Kansas’s Larned State Hospital from 1983-1995, wrongfully and involuntarily institutionalized, having been deemed “mentally ill” and “a danger to herself,” simply because no one could understand her native language. She was finally released in part of efforts by Kansas Advocacy and Protective Services, and was able to return home where she lived with her niece until her passing in 2018. Although she died of natural causes, the psychotropic drugs being pumped into her system for twelve years at Larned State Hospital, without her consent, inevitably shortened her life span. She came out of Larned having developed tardive dyskinesia, as well as symptoms of steppage gait and bradykinesia. Not only did she have declining mobility — the trauma of being stripped from her culture and isolated would undoubtedly have caused Rita to come out of Larned a different person.I was immediately struck by how horror and beauty are weaved so tightly together in Rita’s narrative. My mom’s side of the family is from the same state of Mexico in which Rita lived, and my great-grandfather spoke the indigenous Tarahumara language, Rarámuri. Due to this familial connection, and to how deeply Rita’s story resonated with me, I felt called to bring more awareness to her story, beyond articles who have written her off as a mere “news spectacle,” in the hopes to honor her and aid in efforts of bringing her justice. In this way she is Hamlet, and I, an aspiring Horatio.But I also wanted to know the parts of her story not defined by tragedy. I began to dig beyond the spectacular. I reached out to the director and producer of the documentary, shared a poem I wrote about her with them, and simply expressed how moved I was by their film. A couple of weeks later, I was on the phone with the director Santiago, who had had a friendship with Rita — I learned more about Rita, about who she really was, from this phone call than from any article I had read. I learned about her tenacity and stubbornness; I learned about her kind heart. These are the parts of stories that matter just as much (if not more) than the spectacularities. As much as it hurts us to admit, at the end of the day, we are not defined by our accolades and accomplishments — but by our character, our heart, our personhood. It is from stories that we learn about people's humanity. It is from stories that we learn about people’s idiosyncrasies that make us love them even more.And so, storytelling matters, especially for those unable to tell their own stories. Storytelling works to recognize, preserve, honor and empower.What exactly are we recognizing and preserving? In Rita’s case, by telling her story, we recognize the duality of harm and beauty in her narrative. We recognize her anguish and her loneliness. We recognize her love for her culture. By telling her story, we preserve her legacy of strength and audacity to take the road less traveled. We preserve her story as one among countless victims of ignorance, hatred, racism and neglect. We preserve her story because it is important to — and because we should care about indigenous justice. Her name deserves to be known. Who are we honoring and empowering? In Rita’s case, we honor her and her family. We honor those we tell stories about simply by telling their stories — and by telling their stories we empower not only them, but ourselves. Sharing Rita’s story empowered me to begin telling my own. One outlet has been Say the Thing here at Duke, which is “a rad experiment in storytelling and moral agency development” as written on their website page. It is a truly special collective, and I have just completed one of their projects called “the Hamster” — an incredible initiative that induces life reflection and introspection. Think of it as a meaningful version of digital scrapbooking in which I was able to highlight the moments, places and people that have made me who I am. Another way I have been telling my own story is through a class I enrolled in this fall called “Death, Burial, and Justice in the Americas.” One of our assignments of the semester titled the “Chosen Ancestor Project” involved genealogical research, which made me realize how little I actually know about my ancestors, despite having two living grandparents with whom to share my inquiries. Inspired, I have made a pact with myself to ask my grandfather to tell me about my Irish ancestors when I see him this Christmas. This project ultimately lent me the opportunity to return to Rita’s story and uncover even more about her, as I selected her as my “chosen ancestor.” Through her, I learned more about myself and my Mexican culture. By presenting her story to the class, I presented my own, in a way. This being said, one does not need to find established collectives or classes at Duke to begin their own journey with storytelling. Storytelling begins simply by asking people how their day is going (people are receptive to kindness!), and giving life updates to friends. Indeed, it is through human connection and love that stories are carried on. As I write this, I sit in front of an ofrenda I put up for Rita in my home for Dia De Los Muertos, I feel close to her — the true gift of storytelling is that it bonds the storyteller and the subject of the story forever. In the picture I printed out of her, her palms rest on each side of her face, resting above her chin. Her kind, crinkled, tired brown eyes look up at me, watching me type. It is the Tarahumara’s belief that once they die, they return to the sky and become stars: “otra vez al cielo volverá,” I write in my poem to her. Even though Rita suffered unimaginable injustice during her life, I see her among the stars, surpassing the story of violence that had once hoped to define her.

Writing in a time of robots,Aaron Siegle,2024-12-06T13:00:00Z,Dec,6,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/writing-in-time-of-robots-20241206.html,"Information is power. Who gets to distribute information and how has shaped the course of history. After Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in 1439, he was sued by one of his investors over unpaid loans. The lawsuit broke Gutenberg’s monopoly on the machine, allowing the printing press to spread across Europe and gave rise to improved literacy rates and the scientific revolution. Today, we are in the midst of another information revolution — and another lawsuit. In 2023, The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging that the two companies infringed on the Times’ copyrighted material when training their AI models. If the Times wins, then the large language model (LLM) creators must compensate publishers before using their content. Beyond its financial implications, this case is an important reminder that LLMs, arguably the most popular AI tool, don’t operate in a vacuum. Rather, they rely on millions of lines of text written by humans to provide answers. Most people want AI to write their essays, but few understand how chatbots read your work. Writing is all about exchanging ideas in a manner that is understandable to an audience. But what happens when that audience is no longer human? Does this fundamentally change the way that we write? Or are LLMs merely an intermediary, a translator between content creators and their audience, plagued with a short attention span?To answer these questions, we first need to understand how an LLM accesses and reads text. For LLM to answer prompts accurately, it first must be trained, which exposes the model to massive amounts of text data. By analyzing millions of words, the model can understand patterns in the text and predict syntax, allowing it to mimic human prose. However, the text needed to train the AI models must come from somewhere. AI developers have disclosed that they use the Common Crawl, a massive dataset that archives all the publicly available content on the internet. If your work is publicly available somewhere on the internet, then it is likely somewhere in LLM training data.As the Times lawsuit suggests, many people are upset that AI developers are using their writing and want to put a stop to it. But, for those of us who don’t have the money or technical expertise to sue OpenAI, we must live with the reality that AI is a member of our audience. If AI is reading our work, then how should we respond?Unlike human readers, which often jump around or skim an article, LLMs read text in a sequential manner, processing one word at a time. However, this doesn’t mean that the article understands your work, at least in a traditional sense. Though LLMs are effective at summarizing text and extracting key points, they struggle to decipher abstract concepts and apply contextual information when reading a piece. LLMs see your work as a means to help it better generate sentences, not to grapple with the challenges your work is addressing. So, with this information in mind, is there a certain writing style that AI prefers?To answer this question, I asked Gemini, Google’s LLM-based chatbot. In response, it gave me examples of a good sentence for AI to read and a bad sentence. The good sentence: ""The recent study found that regular exercise significantly improves cognitive function in older adults."" The bad sentence: ""While the research indicated a potential link between exercise and cognitive health, further studies are needed to fully understand the complex relationship.”These sentences, which are most likely summaries of the results of a scientific paper, expose the flaws of LLMs. It is clear that the sentence which is ""bad"" for AI is much more effective at conveying the true results of the study and the uncertainty surrounding them. Demonstrating causality is a tough hill to climb; Gemini appears to ignore the scientific rigor needed to reach it. AI admits that it hates complexity. That’s troubling, given that we live in a highly complex world.You may be thinking, why should I care if AI reads my writing? After all, my work is only a tiny fraction of the millions of items the model is exposed to. In fact, LLMs are utterly reliant on human-generated content to properly function. The increasing prevalence of AI-generated content on the web has created an existential threat for LLMs. Researchers found that when LLMs are trained on text produced by other AI models, they fail. Instead of producing the coherent, punctual responses that we expect from chatbots, the LLM trained on AI-generated prose responded with gibberish filled with repeats and stray characters. This phenomenon, known as model collapse, underscores the importance of keeping human-generated content on the web. Without humans, LLMs are unable to observe trends in the real world and interpret them with reasonable accuracy. LLMs will not eliminate the need to write. In fact, the rise of AI will make writing even more important. As more people stop writing and opt to have LLMs do their work for them, those that continue to produce new content will exert an even larger influence over future training data — and the models reliant on them. Though many argue that LLMs are an equalizer in information access, I disagree. Given that LLMs essentially regurgitate information they find on the web, the decline of human authorship will result in more robots paraphrasing fewer humans’ writing. And this select group that continues to write will influence more people through the intermediary of AI. Another takeaway is the importance of transparency. It’s difficult to tell whether an article was human- or AI-created, given the inaccuracy of AI content detectors. This lack of traceability is deleterious for everyone involved, but especially for LLM developers themselves. To avoid model collapse, engineers must refrain from recycling AI-generated content into their own model. But this task becomes nearly impossible when one can’t tell the origin of their data. In sum, we shouldn’t change our writing style to accommodate for AI. Even if LLMs are frequently reading our work, they are nourished by the creativity and nuance infused into our prose, even if they claim to prefer bland and straightforward text. The threat posed by model collapse exemplifies how LLMs are fundamentally dependent on real people, despite the hype around their superior capabilities. Original ideas still matter, if even amidst a tsunami of artificially generated noise. Aaron Siegle is a Trinity junior. His pieces typically run on alternate Fridays."
The subtle politics of Duke merchandise,Cara Eaton,2024-12-05T13:00:00Z,Dec,5,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/subtle-politics-duke-merchandise-20241205.html,"Happy holiday season, one and all.If you’re like me, it’s the time of the year for Ubers to RDU and back, time to deal with the fatal ""It’s busy, fares are a lot higher than usual"" notification and then the ludicrous Breeze Airways in-flight drink prices. You may be consumed by the thought of finals or scripting how to cope with the relentless conspiracy theories your great-uncle spouted at Thanksgiving that will inevitably be recycled in December. (Family holidays in the wake of a highly polarized election ain’t for the weak, folks.) May I draw your attention to a far less looming inquiry? What do you wear to the airport?Many of you favor Duke merchandise, and that’s only natural. It’s usually pretty comfortable (sweats), and people have been sporting college merchandise since its invention. Even before that, they probably wore some form of merchandise, possibly a nifty lapel pin or something analogously fashionable for the 1800s. So, it’s no big deal if you do, except that you may face accusations of perniciously propagating classism.There’s not much outright accusation around this issue except as commentary: The hyper-specific subject of Duke merchandise at the airport seems to crop up on the Duke server of the social media app Fizz in occasional, surefire intervals. A quick search discovers posts such as a meme reading “I’M BETTER THAN YOU, AND YOU KNOW IT” captioned “me wearing my duke merch at the airport,” and the question, “Who will be wearing duke merch to the airport to flex” adorned with 1.9k upvotes. Whether these posts are poking fun at the people who wear Duke merchandise or are, rather, self-satirizations is unclear. The item of certainty is that in the minds of many, wearing Duke merchandise to the airport is a consciously-made choice.The apparent motivation is to perform a subtly classist flex, showing others that you aren’t in the Triangle for any old reason; you’re a Duke student, part of a special group with a place of privilege in North Carolina. If not outright classism, maybe it’s a desire for intellectual superiority over other young travelers who may go to lower-ranked schools. Or, again, maybe it’s simply because Duke merchandise is comfortable for traveling. Yet, I’m not entirely convinced it’s that simple, nor are the 1.9k students who upvoted that Fizz post. They agree on some level that a positive correlation exists between wearing Duke merchandise and flexing.I decided to shop for real-life (i.e., non-Fizz) opinions. A fellow sophomore believed students wore Duke merch to the airport because it’s a statement that they associate with Duke over other ""lesser"" universities in the area. To her, it’s a way to show that they are specifically in Durham for Duke. It’s a method of proving you’re ""better"" than others; it’s a status thing.Another sophomore contended it wasn’t that deep. She reported that she would wear Duke merchandise to the airport just because most of her sweats are Duke merchandise. She also mentioned that wearing merchandise helps identify fellow Duke students to Uber-share with back to campus — although she had only done this once.It’s not like you must be a Duke student to wear Duke merchandise. However, wearing it to such a public place as the airport may be the most outward way to communicate your status short of flashing your Student ID at transients. A primary source of plausible deniability is that you could be just a Duke fan, as plenty of people, especially in the Triangle, love Duke teams without associating with the university itself.Tangentially, I spoke with a professor who had a similar discussion with his class and reported that they agreed that anyone could technically wear Duke merchandise, which is not the case for Harvard merchandise. He didn’t outwardly state why they made this distinction, but it’s pretty clear it concerns Duke sports. It’s totally rational to be a Duke (basketball) fan from any location or station in the country; it’s a legendary program. That’s not the same for Harvard teams. (Apologies if you’re a Harvard sports fan, but I just don’t believe you.)Duke merchandise exists in some weird semi-contradictory gray area. Most of us agree that anyone with an ounce of Duke fandom can wear it, but we simultaneously believe that by wearing it, we communicate our status as part of this privileged student class. In a sense, we’re performing the role of an extraordinary person on a very public stage and hoping our observers will buy the act. We try to differentiate ourselves from charlatans and imposters who are only in it for our basketball team and to whom this special status is inaccessible. It may be a subtle flex of classism, and if not strictly economic classism, then social or intellectual classism. However, the key is that this classism must feel authentic. The role of a Duke student is one that we hope others will believe we earned and not simply bought off the rack. Merchandise is a powerful uniform if worn convincingly.It’s okay to admit we enjoy the boost in status being a Duke student gives us. At our most innocent, we express pride in belonging to a meaningful community and receiving a transformative education. However, we must be wary of the inimical classism that can infiltrate this pride. Fighting socioeconomic inequality begins when we question what small choices — like wearing Duke merchandise — mean to us and ponder the deeper-rooted motivations at play. We don’t have to become neurotic about such myopic things, but, hey, you’ll need something to think about to distract you from the conversation when your cousin whines about all the women turning to celibacy in the wake of the Trump victory.Cara Eaton is a Trinity sophomore."

Revisiting the complicated history of the Duke rice diet,Nik Narain,2024-12-04T16:30:00Z,Dec,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/complicated-history-duke-rice-diet-20241204.html,"Durham is a city known for many things, like being the “Tastiest Town in the South” for its restaurants and the “City of Medicine” for its many healthcare companies. But for over 50 years, Durham was known as the “Diet Capital of the World.” This reputation stems directly from our medical school, where over 80 years ago a physician would develop one of the most powerful and controversial metabolic treatment regimens, putting Duke Medicine on the map as a pioneer in the science and psychology of obesity.Walter Kempner was a German physician who joined the Duke School of Medicine faculty in 1934. He arrived in Durham with a core group of German refugees fleeing Nazi persecution. Kempner was interested in studying metabolic diseases like hypertension and diabetes. He observed that those diseases were less common in cultures where rice was a staple food and further determined that diets with low salt and fat content can enhance weight loss. In 1939, Kempner developed a formula of rice, fruit, juices and vitamins called the “Rice Diet” and began using it to treat high blood pressure, which was considered fatal at the time with a life expectancy of just six months.Kempner presented his preliminary findings at the 1944 American Medical Association convention and people were shocked by the results. Early participants of the Rice Diet program were reported to have a drastic reduction in weight, blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as a rapid improvement in kidney failure. As these dramatic results were repeated, many experienced physicians suspected him of falsifying data. They further critiqued the lack of a control group in his study and the 60 and 25 individuals out of his original 192-member cohort who did not show any health improvement or died, respectively. Nevertheless, given the lack of available treatments for metabolic conditions then, the Rice Diet was a revolutionary intervention, and the diet quickly grew to national fame.By 1945 people around the world were moving to Durham to undergo the Rice Diet intensive regimen at an inpatient facility called the Rice House. Up until the early 90s, participants paid about $150 per week (the equivalent of about $3400 today) to eat Rice Diet meals, essentially just unsalted white rice and canned fruit, and rented apartments downtown. Participants were required to limit their fluid intake, go off any existing medications and give daily urine samples to monitor sodium levels, which Kempner would post on a community bulletin. The program had an impressive list of alumni including Buddy Hackett, Wendy Wasserstein and, allegedly, Elvis. The widespread acclaim of the Rice Diet prompted the establishment of several “reducing salons” or “health spas” in the 1950s and 1960s such as Figurecare of Durham and Slimorama Health salon, expanding Durham’s diet landscape beyond medical facilities. Between 1969 and 1989, the number of diet-focused businesses tripled in Durham, and at its peak in the 80s, these diet programs brought in 6.5 million dollars into Durham. Dieting was more than a treatment; it was a community, one with its own slang terms and social events built around weight loss. This is what made Durham the “Diet Capital of the World.”Obviously, the Rice Diet is not without its controversies. It’s a highly restrictive regimen that is deficient in multiple micro and macronutrients. Undertaking the Rice Diet meant uprooting one’s entire life; for example, former Ricer and author Jean Renfro Anspaugh dropped out of law school and sold most of her belongings just to go on the diet. Some patients developed life-threatening electrolyte imbalances in his care and had to be hospitalized. Kempner was known to be a strict, uncompromising man who was reported to whip and sexually abuse patients who avoided or broke from the diet, resulting in a 1993 lawsuit by former Ricer Sharon Ryan. The lawsuit was only settled after Kempner’s death in 1997. The Rice House separated from its association with Duke Medical Center five years later. After nearly 70 years of operation, in 2013 the Rice House shut down as its customers dwindled. That same year, businessman and former Rices John Aycoth opened the Rice Diet Healthcare Program, a 13,000-square foot facility minutes from downtown Durham carrying on the legacy of Kempner’s work. The Rice Diet has treated 18,000 patients from all around the world. The detailed records of 16,155 adult Rice Diet patients can be found in a dataset under Duke Nephrology, the results of what is considered the largest diet intervention study ever undertaken. Although it’s now considered a “fad diet” on many popular health websites, it’s a mind-boggling reality to reflect on how powerful the Rice Diet was in shaping the landscape of diet culture not just in Durham, but the country. What this story shows us about the allure of weight loss and the lengths our culture pushes to pursue it can be an entire thesis. At the very least, what the Rice Diet leaves us is a complicated legacy of community built on restriction, science rife with controversy and treatment with a strained relationship with care. As written in the conclusion in a 2014 review of Kempner’s work by the American Heart Association, “Stubbornness is both a helpful and a harmful attribute in scientific discovery.”Nik Narain is a Trinity senior.

Confessions of a discount factor,Anna Garziera,2024-12-03T13:00:00Z,Dec,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/confessions-discount-factor-20241203.html,"Today’s dollar will be worth less tomorrow. That is the premise on which temporal discounting, a major tool in economic theory, is based on. If we want to compare present and future payoffs, we must account for the fact that we tend to value the same payoff less if it’s in the future.It’s easy to think about it in terms of inflation: If prices will be higher in the future, the same amount of money wouldn’t buy us as much tomorrow as it could today. So it makes sense that we’d prefer getting the same amount of money today than tomorrow. And logically, it makes sense that if the monetary payoff is the same today and in the future, we can be no worse off by receiving it today. We can simply wait to spend it until the time is right. But people are impatient. A lot of us would prefer $50 now rather than $100 next year. Unless you fear hyperinflation or think your average annual portfolio is more promising than Warren Buffet’s, justifying this choice is no easy task. Yet many make it nonetheless.Similarly, our propensity to discount the future is so great it makes us spend money today rather than save for tomorrow.Investing our money doesn't just preserve the purchasing power of our money — it increases it. Even if we consider the safest of investments — say, a nine-month CD — our returns would outpace inflation. Instead of investing, however, American consumers throw their money at the next shiny item: They often purchase non-essentials with money they don’t own.Discounting doesn’t only apply to cash. We college students prefer to go out tonight and study tomorrow. Children prefer one marshmallow now to two 15 minutes later. When it comes to pleasure, we don’t like to wait. Many studies have suggested that we might do a lot better individually and collectively if we were only more patient. If we weighed payoffs with logic rather than emotion, we could start thinking of choices as long-term investments. No new dress is worth going under for. No Halloween party is worth failing a midterm for. No fifteen-minute wait is painful enough to make it worth getting one marshmallow instead of two.The literature on patience is rich — the first studies go back to the 1930s — and online advice on how to achieve it is plentiful. But there hasn’t been much investigation into the legitimacy of temporal discounting. Though no major studies have proven its validity — and the few that did only went so far as arguing that it manifests differently in different people — many accept temporal discounting as fact, as an inescapable influence on our behavior. While it does influence our decisions — both monetary and otherwise — it’s still just a theory. One could even argue that its influence on us stems directly from our blind acceptance of it. And we can use that to our advantage.I find that, in many areas of my life, temporal discounting does not apply. And it’s not because I’m a patient person — my parents will testify to that. It’s because in some situations, the same reward is better in the future because it is in the future. For a lot of things, we know this already. Imagine how disappointed you’d be if Christmas were tomorrow. You’d be taken off-guard. You wouldn’t have had any time to savor the magic leading up to the big day. And that’s the best part. If you’re anything like me, every year you remember that there’s nothing particularly special about Christmas Day. The utility we get from Christmas is immense. Yet most of the value we garner comes earlier in the season. Hearing the first Christmas songs of the season come on the radio. Reserving your Christmas tree. Little joys compounded. What makes Christmas so wonderful is the wait.While some might argue that counting these “little joys” that come earlier in the season is cheating, I disagree. Even if we put those aside and focus only on Christmas day, our anticipation in the months prior magnifies the utility we get on the day of. This might explain why the party planner often gets more utility from a surprise party than the birthday boy or girl. It turns out, a lot of us love to plan parties. Or, at the very least, be on the invite list. We love to think about what we’ll wear and what food we’ll bring — all while trying to keep the surprise party a secret. But few of us like to get the other end of the stick. We are relieved to find out about our surprise party a few days early. God forbid our friends actually manage to keep it a secret and catch us off-guard.This goes for a lot of things in life. Our stress levels rise if we find ourselves on a different path to the one we thought we were on — even if it’s a good path. Think of being asked to go up on the stage for receiving an award during school assembly or bumping into an old teacher at the mall. We love knowing our destinations in advance. We love looking forward to them.Succeeding academically, finding true love and building our careers are sweeter because they don’t come to us easily. Fighting for them takes diligence. And waiting for them takes lots and lots of patience. But that’s not a bad thing. We’d be better off if we changed our mindsets. Instead of giving in to the narrative that we hate having to wait, we should challenge our tendency to discount future rewards. We’ll be waiting for something for most of our lives. It’s in our interest to become better at it. It’s often true that future rewards are better than present ones. And it’s not because of compound interest. It’s because the wait is the very thing that makes them valuable.Anna Garziera is a Trinity sophomore. Her pieces typically run on alternate Tuesdays."
How will you end?,Luke A. Powery,2024-12-02T16:00:00Z,Dec,2,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/how-will-you-end-20241202.html,"Here we were at the end of another semester, so I’m thinking about endings. We’ve come out of a holiday and will soon enter another one, but before that, we will have to navigate a series of endings. Maybe there’s a class that has been challenging or invigorating, but either way, how you finish that class will say something about your character. So often, the headline news spotlights start-up companies where the excitement is in the beginning of a new venture. Tons of money are poured into new innovations and new collaborations. Start-ups, beginnings, seem to win the day. What doesn’t get much attention at all is the end. Doesn’t it matter how we end, too? The last act, the last word, the last thought, the final exit off the stage, not just how we enter but how we end?For some, when you talk about ""the end,"" it can be scary. The end can bring fear because it’s unknown. Throughout history, whenever there have been international and national political, religious, environmental and institutional crises, some have thought the end was near. When the world seems to be coming apart, it disrupts a certain type of comfortable experience for some in which everything works for them. The prospect of dramatic change can cause existential burdens to bubble up. It’s not surprising that we don’t want to think about how we will end — this semester, this calendar year, a relationship, a bad behavior or anything else.I have admired individuals who, before the end of their earthly lives, took great care to prepare for the end as best as they could. They made peace with themselves and family members. They ensured their estate plans were in place. They tried doing the activities they enjoyed with the people whom they enjoyed. They made plans for how and where they wanted to be in the end. Writers of fiction take great care with how they end their stories. The end may never leave the reader’s imagination. Take these for example: In her novel Beloved Toni Morrison’s last written word is ""Beloved."" In Mary Shelley’s ""Frankenstein,"" the last words are: ""He was soon borne away by the waves, and lost in darkness and distance."" Marilynne Robinson’s Gilead closes with, “I’ll pray, and then I’ll sleep.” Ralph Ellison’s ""Invisible Man"" ends with, ""Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?"" Zora Neale Hurston’s ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" ends with ""She called in her soul to come and see.""Another genre of literature that emphasizes endings is apocalyptic writing. It has been called ""crisis literature"" by scholar Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza in her work on the Bible’s Book of Revelation. What’s typical in this genre of literature are images of war, earthquakes, and famines. The sun can be darkened, the moon turned to blood, and the stars begin to fall, while the entire cosmos collapses. The spiritual “My Lord What a Morning” captures this in its lyrics:""My Lord, what a morning My Lord what a morning My Lord, what a morning When the stars begin to fallYou’ll hear the trumpet sound To wake the nations underground Looking to my God’s right hand When the stars begin to fall""As a divinity professor and ordained minister, you won’t be surprised that I am compelled by the opening lines of the Bible — ""In the beginning God created …"" But today, as I reflect on an aunt who recently died, the ending line of the Bible draws me in even closer — ""The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.""We can’t stop endings from happening. They’re coming. Ending a semester is only one end, though an important one. As a young person, one may not ponder too often the end of life, but there are ""little ends"" every day — how do you end each day before going to bed? What tasks did you complete today? What will be your parting words to your friends or colleagues before the holiday break? What kind of lasting impression do you want to leave in a class or dormitory or with friends? Don’t neglect the end. It may be the beginning we all need.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel. His column runs on alternate Mondays."
I deleted Instagram. Here’s what changed.,Susan Chemmanoor,2024-11-26T13:00:00Z,Nov,26,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/i-deleted-instagram-20241126.html,"Social media has been quietly rotting my brain for the past seven years. At first, it was fun. Instagram was non-malicious and non-insidious. It was just a fun way to update my friends on my most recent haircut, a great breakfast sandwich or a particularly cute picture of my dog. But more recently, it has infiltrated the way I think about myself and the way I live my life. Instagram has forcibly turned me into a voyeur of my own reality. So, I deleted it. Before I come off as a self-righteous off-the-grid-holier-than-thou character, know that I occasionally redownload and doom scroll for hours, for I am only human. But, taking intentional breaks has made me conscious of how the app literally rewires my brain. And I know you’re tired of this spiel. You’ve probably heard the anti-social media tirade from your parents for far too many Thanksgivings. But, I ask you to read this piece with an open mind. I challenge you to really consider if that magenta square on your phone makes your life better or worse. We’ve been tricked into thinking it's normal to take in mammoth amounts of information about people you don’t care about. I’m not trying to be brash, but think about it. How many of the 1000-something people you follow do you really know? How many of them could recognize you in real life? How many could you sustain a conversation with, without praying someone rescues you from the horrors of small talk? But, most importantly, why do you care so much about these strangers’ lives? Answer earnestly. Do you really need to know if Riley from 3rd grade has a boyfriend now? Or that that one girl on your high school’s soccer team broke up with hers? And listen, I love a good piece of gossip as much as the next person, but as I found myself so stupidly invested in strangers’ lives, I lost sight of my own. Instagram encourages you to place serious value on meaningless metrics. You start judging the photos you post by noting how many people commented, clicked a red heart or sent the post to their friends. When a post does particularly “bad”, you begin to wonder what you’ve done wrong. Was your hair right in the cover picture? Why did Kelly not repost? Do you look ugly in the third slide? Why didn’t he comment? You begin to do an unpaid PR analysis for yourself every time you decide to show the world your new outfit. You begin to perform for an audience who you’ve convinced yourself truly cares. For me, the eyes felt like they never stopped watching. Even in the comfort of my own room, it felt like I had to perform. That I had to look pretty and desirable even when I was just doing homework at my desk. It was a larger symptom of internalized male gaze, or the need to look beautiful when nobody’s around. In this way, Instagram has a uniquely insidious effect on young women. The app rewards women who are constantly performing, albeit sometimes unconsciously. It rewards women who stress about whether they should re-wear an already posted dress in a new post. It rewards women who obsessively doom scroll down a new friend’s page only to find out she’s so much cooler than herself. It rewards women who torment themselves over how boring their lives look online compared to their friends. There’s also the old argument of “Well I’m just documenting my life.” I used to say that too. But, on the 50th try to get the perfect picture on a family vacation, something snapped. This wasn’t the honest “documentary” of my life I was convincing myself I had nobly been creating. It was a meticulously curated feed of pretty people in perfect places. It was exhausting.So, what’s changed since I deleted the app? To put it simply, a newfound freedom has emerged. Though my beloved digital camera comes with me when I go out with friends, the photos are for us. There is no added pressure to look perfect for the vast sea of people that is the internet. Sometimes, photos aren’t even taken. But life goes on. You don’t need photo evidence to prove you had fun. You know that age-old question: “Did you even go on vacation, if you didn’t post?” The answer is yes.Of course, old habits die hard. Occasionally my old insecurities will flare again, often sparked by a fresh LinkedIn doomscroll. But, with my new recognition of my free will, I can save myself from a night of spiraling about my peer’s accomplishments. It feels melodramatic to characterize this new freedom from a phone app as some long-struggled triumph. But it really does feel like I’ve regained a part of myself that was snatched away from me.If you’ve truly never experienced any of my grievances with Instagram, then congratulations, you’re a stronger person than I am. But, maybe for some of you, this resonated. I urge you to try taking a break. Maybe just for a week. Go outside. Talk to your real friends. Call your parents (yes I’m looking at you, person who hasn’t called their mom in a month). Live your life in the real world, before it's too late. Susan Chemmanoor is a Trinity sophomore. "
What your favorite library says about you,Shambhavi Sinha,2024-11-25T13:00:00Z,Nov,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/favorite-library-says-about-you-20241125.html,"I enjoy the Duke libraries (controversial, I know). It is the perfect locale to glimpse into the lives of Duke students and exemplifies much of what we seek from learning and being here. From the endless scribbles on the Edge whiteboards to the little doodles on the Perkins work desks, all demonstrate how we interact with academic spaces and leave our mark on them. And when we interact with these spaces, we grow attached. After all, humans are creatures of habit: We define spaces and mould ourselves into them. We gravitate toward certain spaces more than others, be it because of the vibes, the people or some combination of both. Some of us will go to war over their spot in the third row, second from the left at the Gothic Reading Room, while others will exclusively study at the Co-Lab, even if it's 3 a.m. (actually, especially if it's 3 a.m.). And when we occupy these spaces over the course of four years, they come to define us as much as we define them.We will change the culture here, as it will change us. Place and person collide, converging to a new equilibrium altogether different from our initial conditions — just like a thermodynamic system. Whether it is the libraries closing earlier because of disuse or the “share a story” machines, we are redefining how we connect with libraries and each other. And in the same sense, we will be influenced by those talking about existentialism next to us while we're trying to study or by the Kafka and Chargaff exhibits in Perkins. We will take this beyond our time here, and it will reflect in the journeys that we forge henceforth. So let us embark on one such journey, and hear out my extremely accurate, realistic and non-negotiable takes on the libraries — and you, dear reader. Perkins LibraryStarting off with the canonical Duke Library: the safest bet. Basic even, I’m afraid. Perkins comes off to me as the most Duke-coded library. If your favourite library is Perkins, it would not surprise me if you also applied early decision here. Perkins brings with it much conversation: The first floor is in a constant state of activity. It seems familiar, like an old friend at a cafe on an autumn day. Speaking of cafes: Saladelia. You enjoy coffee, and the aroma it brings to the library. You enjoy studying hard (or hardly studying) with your friends and the presence of other people. But despite this, there are parts of you that seek solitude. In the silence of the fourth floor, you enjoy the view of the chapel as you study. Occasionally, you’ll fall asleep in the OASIS, but you never tell anyone about it because your secret spot could get stolen. You enjoy the modernity of design, the near liminal feel of some floors. Sometimes, you’ll run through the stacks, feeling their never-ending grandeur envelope you. Or … you’ll try to complete some graduation requirements. I don’t know. What I do know is that you’re a personable and fun person to be around, and you’re trying to find a balance in who you are and where you want to be. You meet people in the middle, and see them for what they are. Rubenstein LibraryYou’re not in “Dead Poets Society” or “The Secret History,” and that’s your biggest disappointment with life. Rubenstein is, to me, the grandest of the libraries. I remember being a freshman and being awestruck by the entrance, which seemed straight out of “Legend of Zelda.” You probably share this awe and read a lot of classics and philosophy. You may think you’re not like other people. You’re attached to the moody feeling the Gothic Reading Room gives you and are in the minority who aren’t scared by the deafening silence that befalls the room. You enjoy the solitude of life and long walks with the winter breeze blowing in your hair. You are possibly guilty of listening to too many dark-academia playlists and staring pensively out of the third-floor windows, pretending to be the main character of an indie coming-of-age film. You enjoy the arts and the way history intertwines with it. You give good advice to friends, but struggle to apply them to yourself. You enjoy the past and often find yourself reminiscing and retrospecting. Occasionally, you will have a coughing fit in the Gothic Reading Room and think about it for days when the person sitting across gives you the irritated side-eye. But you shouldn’t. (They were probably just concerned for your well-being.) You’re a very interesting person, and I think conversations with you turn deep no matter the start. Sometimes, you’re difficult to find, because you close early during the holidays. Your insight and presence is always valued by those around you.Bostock LibraryYou’re (delusionally) confident that you can find an empty Project Room, or that you haven’t overworked yourself to dark circles darker than a black hole. Bostock is like a spring day, with its warm lighting and ample couches. The upper floors are meditative, looking out to E-quad and around. The desks are littered with little doodles and words of encouragement. I think you’re endlessly optimistic and believe in the goodness of those around you. You contribute well to group projects, much to the relief of others. You like working with people, but enjoy your own company the most. Your need for sleep will occasionally overpower your endless passion for your work, which is when your friends will catch you napping on the couches on the fourth floor, with your jacket on your face. You’re the opposite of Rubenstein-goers in your endless consumption of light-academia playlists. You seem to enjoy technology, and exploring how it intersects with society is often on your mind. You want to travel the world. Most likely, you’ve accidentally played music aloud in the Carpenter Reading Room, thinking your headphones were connected. You’ve maybe stared for a bit too long out of that window, though. Not your fault: The green of those trees takes you to a stirring reverie. You’re a dreamer and a doer. You know what you want, and you want a lot. But if there’s a person who I know could make it come alive, it’s you. People will end up taking less than flattering pictures of you if you keep napping on the couches, but that’s what memories are for, right?Bonus: Lilly LibraryYou peaked in first year. That’s it. Not really ... But you did have a great freshman year, and you perhaps read more comics than your Linear Algebra textbook (I fear you cooked yourself). Lilly reminds me of a summer day, warm but bright. I think of the radiant marble reflecting the light of the sun, the inside cool and calm. You’re someone who enjoys the idea of the future, but always ends up missing the past. You like your academic spaces to reflect your personality, and sometimes this causes you to get distracted quickly. Like that time when you ended up watching the 3D printers for an hour. You enjoy meeting new people, to an extent, and observing them. You’d sometimes sit in the reading rooms, subjecting yourself to people flirting at the table next to you. This time, you were the one giving the irritated side-eye. (It won’t work, sorry.) So you’ll end up in the stacks, staring out at the tennis courts. You’ll think about your (very short) time here. You’ll think about the many clubs you’re in (that number will decline rapidly) and the friends awaiting you at Marketplace. You’re always thinking about something or the other. You like aesthetics, but not when it compromises with practicality, much like the distinct vibes of the second floor of Lilly, contrasted with the modernism of the basement. You have had conversations too loud in there or tripped on the way to the basement, but it's okay. You were learning. And that’s the best thing about you. You’re always growing, you’re always changing. You’re thinking about the past, the present, the future. Who you were, who you are, and who you will be. You’re scared. You’re excited. And that’s what makes you compelling. You’re always trying. The library you spend twelve hours “locking in” at is just one of the many ways that Duke shapes each of us. While there are many study spots on campus — and we all have our favorites — know that there exists a (secret) best choice. Which one? That is for me to know and you to find out!Shambhavi Sinha is a Trinity sophomore. Her pieces typically run on alternate Mondays."
Cutting people off over politics,Sonia Green,2024-11-22T13:00:00Z,Nov,22,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/cutting-people-off-over-politics-20241122.html,"When I woke up on November 6th, I immediately checked my phone. Although I had a strong suspicion that I knew who America had elected as our president, I wanted to be sure. After I received confirmation that I was right, a small part of me was happy; my prediction was correct. However, I felt an overwhelming sense of disappointment and concern for my community. In the Mary Lou Williams Center for Black Culture (also called the Lou), we had many conversations about what Donald Trump’s new presidency would mean for the Black community. We were all very concerned, stressed and anxious. Many of my peers conducted a mass unfollowing on social media, purging their accounts of all connections to Trump supporters, and I understand. For the sake of mental health, I believe it is completely acceptable to remove Trump supporters from your life.As a North Carolinian, I was not surprised to see Donald Trump win over the state. I’ve seen Trump supporters around Durham, at the state fair in Raleigh and even at a Duke football game. I was surprised to see him sweep every single swing state. From Georgia to Pennsylvania to Michigan, Trump supporters represented close to a majority of voters.Navigating Duke’s campus after such a tense election was a nerve-wracking experience. I don’t mind the idea of having peers with different political views, but this election represented so much more than just political polarization. It represented women’s healthcare, public education, immigration and democracy, and just like Barack Obama’s campaign in 2008, it represented a racial reckoning for America. It’s really difficult to tell at first glance who believes what. I don’t intend to marginalize Duke students who voted for Trump, but as a Black student, it is scary to know that there are students here who subscribe to his beliefs.This election represents too much. It’s scary to know that there are people who support his pledge to abolish the Department of Education which, among other things, provides supplemental funding to high-poverty K-12 schools. This will directly impact the millions of students whose only option is their local public school. Why should the state of Florida get to dictate what Floridians learn in school when they have already taught students that “some Black people benefited from slavery because it taught them useful skills”? Trump’s mass deportation plan is also concerning. Latinos, both documented and undocumented immigrants, are an integral part of our society and a mass deportation would be devastating. This policy would cost Americans at least $315 billion. If someone cannot support these policies, then they have every right to remove the people in their lives who do.In the name of tolerance, equality and bipartisanship, I have seen many Trump supporters on social media complain that it is unfair to judge people based on their political beliefs. But I don’t think that’s what's happening here. People aren’t cutting off friends, family members and significant others over their affiliation with a different political party. We have come to associate this election with morality and ethics and that is what prompts the severing of these relationships. An opposing vote now comes with a moral judgment. A vote for Donald Trump is now viewed as a vote against so many things that we hold dear such as diversity, economic opportunity and reproductive rights.I’m not sure I’m best suited to provide much advice to students who may feel marginalized because they voted for Trump. All I can do is recommend that they open themselves up to a respectful dialogue with people who are hurt by their actions, while also understanding that many people won’t want to talk to them. We’re living in a tough time where some people feel “other-ed” based on their political views, and others are genuinely concerned about their futures.I hope the next four years can be a peaceful time where we as a country can come together across political lines, but I’m not very optimistic. Politics have become too polarizing. With the election of an abrasive figure like Donald Trump, people must take care of their mental health. If that means cutting people off, so be it.Sonia Green is a Trinity senior. Her pieces typically run on alternate Thursdays. "
Life beyond the game: Redefining purpose after golf,Sophia Bae,2024-11-22T13:00:00Z,Nov,22,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/life-beyond-the-game-20241122.html,"One day, I was a varsity women’s golf recruit with aspirations shaped by years of training and competing — the next, I was a former athlete faced with an overwhelming question: What is my purpose now? I always knew that I could be recruited to a school that was accomplished as one of the best teams in women’s golf. And I was. At the young age of fourteen, I verbally committed to play golf for Duke University. This was an incredible honor, and I have Coach Dan Brooks and Coach Jon Whithaus to thank for seeing my potential. The commitment reinforced the game of golf into my identity, which pushed me to practice harder throughout the rest of high school. As a result, I developed my first major long-term injury in my freshman year of high school — a herniated disc in the L4-L5 region of the spine. I was trying everything I could to recover — physical therapy, acupuncture, dry needling, massages, etc. But continuing to golf made my body stiffer, preventing me from properly healing. It felt as if my body was yelling at me to stop, but my mind would be too obsessed with perfection in performance to give in to that warning. Although this was a big injury, I continued to play golf through the pain; I could not just give up and disappoint everyone who had supported me. Golf was who I was, what I represented and my life’s success. However, I was in pain physically and emotionally. I struggled to play my best because of how much pain my lower back would be in when I hit the ball. As soon as I entered my freshman year at Duke, the doctor had ordered me to skip out on practices and lifting, due to the state that my body and mind were in. This was quite upsetting, because I felt left out from both my team and my game. I have always been an ambitious athlete, and hearing someone tell me to stop playing was a completely mind-bending concept. However, I still complied. Who was I to go against medical advice? And so, my freshman year can be described as constant physical therapy and finally redshirting. Redshirting refers to when an athlete chooses not to compete in a certain season, but would still be considered eligible to compete on the team in the future.Once I reached my sophomore year at Duke, my doctor decided to medically retire me as a student-athlete, due to my back injury and other coinciding health factors. Of course, I had to consent to this decision as well, and I proceeded with it for the sake of my overall health. I was not sure how to feel. On one hand, this game had been a part of my identity for over a decade. On the flip side, I was relieved that the pressure to keep up with expectations to excel while struggling with pain was somewhat lifted. Throughout high school, I was not given a chance to consider or imagine letting go of these expectations, due to parental pressures. It felt like I could not escape my perception of being a great golfer.I tried my very best to be optimistic throughout the start of the process, and I pushed myself to experience everything else that Duke had to offer. I met more students through club fairs and events, and found friends who accepted me for who I was at the time, rather than what I had achieved. At first, I was discouraged from going outside of the existing social circle I was in with my teammates and classmates, because it produced so much social anxiety for me. Reflecting back on it, I was definitely scared of the unknown. However, I knew that if I did not try to put myself out there as a Duke student, I would regret missing out on so many amazing experiences with extraordinary people. And today, I have formed so many important relationships — like with my classmates, senior gals and fellow brownies — who have welcomed me with open arms and lit my childhood joy ablaze. I was slowly integrating myself into a somewhat normal undergraduate life, but I still struggled to find my passions outside of golf. My anxiety peaked during this time, and I felt very alone even though I was surrounded by an overwhelming group of new friends. Namely, I started comparing my academic passions with these said friends’, attempting to define what I wanted to study and do after college. Unfortunately, I fell into a black hole of insecurities, harsh self-criticism and disappointment. Yes, I was late to the game — in terms of finding what I wanted to study and work for in the future — but that did not stop me from putting myself down.Once I reached my junior year, I started to give myself more grace with the high expectations that I had placed onto myself. Although substantial time has passed since I medically retired, it felt like I was still adjusting to the normal Duke undergraduate environment. In response, I started to intentionally ground myself in the present so that I would be less likely to overthink and stress about things I needed to get done — both long-term and short-term. I was definitely starting to be more aware of my feelings then. I slowly started to realize that I could only control what I could do. It was and still is so easy to compare my progress with the people I interact with, but I knew I was on my own path and that my hard work would eventually solidify into my passions. Once this realization settled in, I became more comfortable with the unknown, and my excitement and hope for the future started flickering again. To this day, I am still unsure of what I want to pursue in my professional career. But I think I am content with not knowing right now. Everyone seems to have it figured out — to some degree. I used to have it all figured out; I was convinced that my life would be meaningless without a future in golf. Now, I am grateful to have experienced what I achieved in the past, and I am ready to move forward. And I hope that other student-athletes who find themselves in situations, where there are so many uncontrollable factors, understand that it is okay to not have all of the answers right away. Don’t we all deserve to set aside space to heal, explore and redefine our sense of purpose on our own timelines?Sophia Bae is a Trinity senior. "
The bitter brew,Gabriel Markwei,2024-11-22T13:00:00Z,Nov,22,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/the-bitter-brew-20241122.html,"Since the 1960s, college students have operated on one predominant energy source worth relatively two to four dollars: coffee. It’s convenient, stimulating and, principally, reliable, but at what expense to the environment? Coffee is one of the worst beverages to manufacture and consume for the environment due to its repugnant ramifications on the earth and human health. Coffee production and consumption could be a substantial cause of deforestation; per research by the European Coffee Federation, “8.8 million hectares of forest land are lost worldwide,” one of the main drivers of which is the conversion of forest land into farmland. While deforestation is a small share of an enormous climate crisis, it poses the question: What does coffee actually cost? Traditionally, coffee was grown in shaded forest regions; however, when sun-grown coffee became more popular, due to economic and agricultural reasons, farmers needed more farmland to produce this type of coffee to maximize profit. In turn, this unlocked an inlet for the production of sun-grown coffee, through the inconsiderate exploitation of our rainforests. This has consequently led to the degradation of biodiversity, augmented excess greenhouse emissions and intensified temperatures — all contributing to climate change. Now imagine that this degradation is occurring across “2.5 million acres of forest in Central America” that have been obliterated to fund these coffee farms. Paradoxically, according to a Times article, , “About half of the land around the world currently used to produce high-quality coffee could be unproductive by 2050.” This statistic highlights the fallacy within the production of coffee: Although it’s so reliable and convenient, it’s not operating on sustainable, renewable resources. As much as you cherish your sip of coffee every morning, in the long run, that sip will diminish if we continue to produce coffee as we are. The environment cannot sustain this drastic consumption of resources, so, what can we do? I’m fully cognizant of the roughly 69 percent of college students who absolutely cannot function without their morning dose of coffee, so I ask you not to stop drinking coffee entirely, but to drink an alternative just as suitable, energizing, and dependable as coffee, such as tea. In a study published in the journal “Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,” “On a per-liter basis, the carbon emissions of instant coffee are 2.5 times more than for tea ready to drink. The carbon footprint of brewed coffee and latte is much higher due to the increased amount of green coffee required for brewing and the use of milk, respectively.” Tea plants are more robust than coffee, meaning they can withstand harsh weather climates and growth conditions, as opposed to more susceptible coffee plants, which require excess resources to maintain them. Likewise, the amount of water required for fermentation in coffee is much greater than in tea. Tea can maintain its stability from natural amounts of rainwater, requiring no excess water; coffee, however, uses excess water for washing and processing, which often becomes polluted and dumped back into rivers and lakes — destroying their ecosystems. Moreover, tea has logistically been proven to be more eco-friendly without sacrificing any benefits coffee offers, especially its stimulating nature, which tea has been misconceived to harbor less of. According to a blog post from Harvard Medical School, Yaupon Tea has the same amount of caffeine as instant coffee, and the energized effect of tea harbors more longevity than coffee. As the author states, “This tea has 60 mg caffeine per cup and also provides theobromine, a compound structurally similar to the caffeine found in cocoa beans and many teas. Theobromine increases blood flow and may increase energy and alertness, but this boost is slower to start and lasts longer than caffeine, which provides a quick but short-lived boost.”Additionally, the blog post notes that “8 ounces of brewed coffee contains about 95 mg caffeine; instant coffee about 60 mg; black tea about 47 mg; and green tea about 28 mg.” This evidence denounces the notion of tea not being able to match the stimulation of coffee. Tea is just as accessible, reliable and exhilarating as coffee; it is much more eco-friendly and, in some cases, better for the consumer. As students of an esteemed institution, it’s almost criminal for us to internalize the calamitous effects of climate change and do nothing about it — let alone contribute to it. Coffee may not be the leading factor in climate change, nor the leading factor in deforestation; however, we cannot turn a blind eye to its prominence in the grand scheme of the environment. We must acknowledge its presence and work to minimize its loss. Across campus, there are various spots to get tea. Shops like Beyu Blue Coffee, Saladelia, and Trinity Café offer a variety of teas without a drastic price increase. These shops are convenient and relatively cheap, allowing us to continue our everyday beverage experience, just with it being tea. Additionally, education departments could invest in tea bags, which would provide drinkers with a constant option of tea. We have the ability to choose organic and sustainable forms of beverages rather than land-degrading coffee that ultimately destroys ecosystems and communities. So, instead of drinking our ten cups of conventional coffee to get us through the day, let's try ten cups of tea; it’s better for the earth, rich in flavor, and can be just as stimulating.Gabriel Markwei is a Trinity first-year"
You can’t park here (even though you go here),Paul Dilly,2024-11-21T13:00:00Z,Nov,21,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/you-cant-park-here-20241121.html,"Duke, I know you know what I’m talking about. You know why I’m here. As soon as you made that terrible decision on that terrible day — yes, the day you decided to make Blue Zone an Iron Dukes parking lot for home football games — you knew it was wrong. But you did it anyway. Because providing more Iron Dukes parking spots means you can sell more Iron Dukes parking permits, which means you make more money. I get it: You’re a money-making machine, and as such, you’re here to generate as much of it as you can. But there’s a line, and when you chose to prioritize Duke sports fanatics over students who pay $474 for an annual Blue Zone permit — on top of almost $89,000 a year in attendance costs — you most certainly crossed it.Disclaimer: Iron Dukes, I’m not out to get you. In fact, I feel for you. That you have the option to buy a special game-day permit for $90+ only after donating $250+ per year and purchasing season tickets ($69.25+ per year) is absurd. We’re all getting scammed out here.Now, Duke, don’t get me wrong: I’m not here to bash you, either. Nor am I here to tell you to stop making money. Rather, I’m here to help you help us — your precious students — by suggesting ways in which you can save us from having to move our cars during home football games, all while preserving that cash flow you love so dearly (and keeping Iron Dukes happy).The first — and most obvious — way to fix the issue is to simply not make Blue Zone available for Iron Dukes on game day. Duh, right? But hear me out: Move the Iron Dukes parking in Blue Zone to the Graduate Center (GC) Lot — a parking lot many of us relocate to when kicked out of Blue Zone. This is a perfect substitution for several reasons. Blue Zone (1,350) has fewer spots than GC Lot (1,629), so there’s no need to worry about being able to provide enough space. GC Lot is already used for public parking on game days, so it can easily be converted into an Iron Dukes-only lot. Parking in GC Lot is provided for free, so there’s no parking money lost from non-Iron Dukes fans who can no longer park in GC. Further, a shuttle provides free transportation from GC Lot and H Lot to Duke Chapel. The walk from Duke Chapel to Wallace Wade Stadium is just 0.1 miles longer than the walk from Blue Zone to Wallace Wade. The journey will take a tad bit longer, but I’d argue most fans would want to explore campus a bit or grab a bite at WU — aside from those delicious Bavarian pretzels, who would actually want to eat overpriced stadium food if they could help it? — on their way to the game anyway.I know what you’re thinking: ""What about H Lot? Won’t Iron Dukes get pissed when they see free parking — and free shuttles — being offered right next to them?"" Easy: Make H Lot reserved for Iron Dukes too. If you reserve both GC Lot and H Lot for Iron Dukes, that’s 2,565 spots — much more than the roughly 2,000 spots currently offered across all the Iron Dukes lots. What are you going to do with that extra space? Make more money! After giving the Iron Dukes priority, fill the remaining spots with non-Iron Dukes fans, charging a slightly higher rate per game — say, $25 — compared to that of the per-game cost of an Iron Dukes season permit (the price of the season permit divided by the number of home games comes out to $15-$20).Ok, now where do all the remaining fans displaced by the Iron Dukes go? The other public parking lots offered! There is, in fact, enough space to park all cars for an average game, even without the use of Blue Zone. Let’s get the facts straight. The mean attendance at Wallace Wade was 24,505 in 2022. The student section comprises four of 32 sections; if the distribution of fans is uniform across all sections, about 12.5% of the fans in attendance are expected to be students. (I’m ignoring Blue Devil Tower since it offers fewer than 1,000 seats.) Assuming 87.5% of fans travel by car — and given that roughly three people travel to sporting events together — roughly 7,150 parking spaces are required when the stadium has average attendance. There are currently 6,319 public parking spots (including GC Lot and H Lot), and there are just under 1,000 Iron Dukes parking spots, excluding Blue Zone — so we have all the spots we need!Yes, there will be games whose attendance exceeds the average. However, if Wallace Wade were to reach its capacity of 35,000 (not that it ever does), Duke wouldn’t have enough parking spots for everyone even with Blue Zone included: With the same assumptions above, we’d need over 10,000 spots to fit everyone… but Blue Zone only brings the total number of game-day spots available to about 8,500. Ouch — not even close!But what do we do with the parking lots previously reserved for Iron Dukes? Reserve them for ADA parking instead. Currently, two sub-lots in Blue Zone are used for ADA public parking. To avoid having to use Blue Zone at all during game days, instead offer such parking in Whitford. (Though it’s already used for disability parking, it’s only available to those with Iron Dukes permits.) Not only is Whitford just as close to Wallace Wade as Blue Zone, but with space for 140 cars, it also has enough spots to maintain ADA compliance: Given the total number of game-day parking spots Duke offers, only about 100 spots are required to be reserved for people with disabilities (even when including Blue Zone).Still concerned about there not being enough ADA spaces? You can also offer ADA parking in Science Dr Garage. Not only are the second and third levels of this garage already reserved on game days, but they would provide more ADA spots than those offered in Blue Zone. The garage is (slightly) farther from the stadium; however, Duke eases this inconvenience by providing assistive shuttles and wheelchair assistance to fans with disabilities. (Good on you, Duke — you’re finally doing something right.) Card Lot is another good — and closer — option for ADA parking. Excess spaces could be made available to those with Iron Dukes permits, after giving priority to those with disability permits.Ok, I concede: Other universities — Clemson, Kentucky, Arkansas — require their students to move their cars on game days. However, these schools all have something in common that Duke does not: They are football schools. (Or at least compared to Duke they are.) With stadium sizes of 81,500, 61,000 and 76,000, respectively, they have to provide parking for two to three times as many fans as Duke. Stop fooling yourself, Duke. Just because we have a winning record doesn’t mean we’re one of them.If those logistics are too hot to handle, I’ve got another suggestion: Reduce the weeks a given student has to move. For example, you could halve the number of games we each have to move for by forming two groups and alternating between groups each game, such that only students in one group have to move their cars. The bottleneck becomes how full Blue Zone is on a given game day (a stat I cannot provide), but I’d venture to guess that there’s room to keep some students’ cars. If two groups is too much, try three instead — that still saves each of us from having to move for two out of six games.Whew. So many stats. I hope you’re still with me, Duke. If you’re still unconvinced, still unwilling, after all that, I — I got nothing. I laid all my cards. You can keep on stealing our (parents’) hard-earned money and taking advantage of us. We’re powerless to stop you. But I beg you to please reconsider. I know it’s only six days out of the year and only takes an hour total each time. That’s not the problem. Rather, it’s the principle of it: We bought a Blue Zone parking permit valid every day from 2024 Aug. 16 to 2025 Aug. 15, and that’s what we should get. You’ve given me so much, Duke — opportunities, friendships, even game days — and I’m so grateful for that. But every healthy relationship requires communication, and if I’m being honest, you’re failing to treat us right. I know you don’t care — we’re not made of money, after all — and that’s ok. But I need you to know something: A university cannot possibly be dedicated to the “principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and accountability” if it tosses around its students for a quick cash grab.Sound familiar? Yeah. That’s the Duke Community Standard. DDMF.Paul Dilly is a Trinity junior. "
Pelleted by pollution: Why wood biomass is a false solution to the climate crisis,Aaron Siegle,2024-11-20T13:00:00Z,Nov,20,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/wood-biomass-false-solution-to-climate-crisis-20241120.html,"April 23rd, 2009 was an important day for Europe. On this day, the European Commission passed the Renewable Energy Directive, which required that Europe as a whole must produce 20 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. This law is one of the reasons why Europe continues to outpace in the United States in renewable energy development. But a little secret was buried deep within the pages of the expansive statute. The Commission designated biomass, the burning of wood pellets to generate electric power, as renewable energy. The ramifications of this seemingly innocuous decision are still being felt around the world. Soon after the directive was passed, wood pellet processing plants began to pop up around the Southeastern United States. Now, the U.S. is the largest exporter of wood pellets in the world with 90 percent going to Europe, if you include the United Kingdom. Despite the hype around biomass as a ""nature-based solution"" to climate change, the biomass industry is defined by its rising emissions and the pollution it adds to disadvantaged communities. As forests throughout the Southeastern U.S. continue to be felled, lawmakers around the world must ensure that the biomass industry cannot access tax incentives reserved for clean energy. The way that the biomass industry works is simple — cut down trees, process them into pellets and burn them. The heat generated from burning the wood pellets turns water into superheated stream, which then turns a turbine connected to an electrical generator that electrifies our homes, schools and factories. Biomass is such a popular strategy for European nations to meet their renewable energy targets because it can use the exact same infrastructure of coal-fired power plants. All a company needs to do is to start burning wood instead of coal in the boilers of its power plants. A prominent example of this is the Drax Power Station in the U.K., which has been feeding biomass into four its 645 megawatt (MW) coal boilers since 2018. Though biomass is considered renewable due to its ability to grow quickly and derive energy from the sun, this does not mean that it lowers carbon emissions. Because wood pellets have a lower energy density than fossil fuels, they emit 50 percent more CO2 per unit of energy produced than a coal-fired power plant. In addition to the emissions that occur during combustion, forests lost their ability to sequester carbon when they are cut down. Despite this evidence, the biomass industry continues to assert that their operations are carbon neutral or even carbon negative. They argue that because the trees are taking carbon out of the atmosphere during their lifetime, burning wood pellets simply releases that same carbon back into the atmosphere, resulting in no net contribution to climate change. Furthermore, by adding carbon capture technology (essentially a big machine that removes carbon from a smokestack) to biomass-fired power plants, little to no CO2 is released during combustion, resulting in the net sequestration of carbon.This logic is flawed for multiple reasons. First, it assumes that felled forests will regrow and store the same amount of carbon as the trees that have been cut down. In reality, it takes saplings decades to match the levels of carbon absorption that mature trees achieve. Second, it implies that corporations will continue to replant timberlands after they have been cut down. It is not guaranteed that this will occur, whether it be due to economic considerations or ecological challenges such as wildfires. Third, the simple arithmetic on a carbon balance sheet does not account for the other forms of pollution, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrous oxides (NOX) and particulate matter (PM), generated from both biomass-fired power plants and wood pellet processing facilities. Fourth, the biomass industry has an extremely long and carbon intense supply chain. Pellets, which are bulky commodities, must be shipped from the U.S. to power plants thousands of miles away in Europe and Asia.This argument isn’t constrained to environmental circles. Drax Group, which operates the biomass plant in the U.K., was dropped from the S&P 500 Clean Energy Index after financial analyst cast doubt on whether the company truly realized emissions reductions over fossil fuels. From a land use perspective, the inefficiencies of burning biomass for electric power become even more apparent. In essence, biomass turns solar energy into electrical energy. To do so, the tree must absorb the solar energy via photosynthesis and incorporate this energy into its chemical bonds. Then, the tree must be burned, turning this chemical energy into thermal energy, which in turn becomes mechanical energy that is again transformed into electrical energy. All these conversions waste energy, resulting in a 0.3 percent efficiency. However, we do have a technology that can convert solar energy into electricity in just one step — solar panels. Because solar photovoltaics (PV) only require one step to send electrons onto the grid, their efficiency averages at 21 percent. Though this metric can be improved upon, solar is lightyears ahead of biomass. In fact, solar PV can generate 100 times more energy per hectare than biomass. Efficiency is not the only area in which biomass performs poorly. Earlier this year, Enviva, the world's largest producer of wood pellets, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Despite 2024 being a year of record demand for the wood pellets, Enviva is still racking up losses due to faulty equipment that is unable to cope with tough pine resin. The company’s best shot at survival is securing tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) meant for clean energy technologies. The U.K.’s largest biomass consumer, Drax, has made a living off government subsidies. By utilizing two programs meant to stimulate renewable energy development, is projected to receive £11 billion ($13.9 billion) in subsidies between 2012 and 2027. On the other hand, wind and solar are now cheaper than natural gas in the U.K., limiting their reliance on subsidies. Biomass’ inefficiency isn’t just environmentally destructive, it’s also bad for business. In today’s global economy, biomass policies made in Europe have tangible impacts halfway across the world. Now, communities across the Southeast US, the global hotspot of biomass production, must endure the noise, pollution and traffic emanating from pellet mills. Pellet mills are predominantly located in rural, low-wealth communities of color, continuing a pattern of environmental injustice. As a result, residents can no longer enjoy the outdoors without inhaling dust and soot and experience disproportionately high levels of illness. It is critical that the biomass industry does not receive IRA tax credits as it is not an effective climate solution. In Europe, the E.U. needs to strengthen its criteria around biomass sourcing, eliminate subsidies for biomass and conduct a more rigorous assessment of biomass’ life-cycle carbon emissions. And in the U.K., renewable energy subsidies should only go to technologies that are proven to emit less carbon than fossil fuels. Disincentivizing biomass burning does not preclude forestry from playing a key role in the energy transition, such as with the construction of mass timber structures. However, by needlessly burning trees to produce paltry amounts of electricity, we are wasting this valuable resource. Trees are one of our greatest assets in fighting climate change — it would be wise to keep them around for a little while longer. Aaron Siegle is a Trinity junior.

Stop listening to sad music this fall — listen to house music instead ,Kate-Yeonjae Jeong,2024-11-20T13:00:00Z,Nov,20,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/stop-listening-sad-music-listen-house-20241120.html,"It’s that time of the year: the temperature has dropped 30 degrees to now an unpredictable back-and-forth of somewhere between 50 and 60, the sun goes down by the time it’s 6 p.m. (and I haven’t even had dinner yet) and everything just feels so … dark. Society likes to call this “seasonal depression.” With midterms occurring back-to-back and the school days getting busier by the minute, it just seems as if things are getting more complex. Some even choose to celebrate this new season with the slew of Spotify playlists that embrace titles like “sad girl fall.” People seem to play slower, moodier, and more broody music around this time of the year as some form of “coping mechanism.” I beg to differ. I believe that sad music only ends up making us sadder, and that it does nothing but exacerbate this weird negative feeling that we get with the shorter daylights and growing workloads. If I am feeling somewhat negative, listening to moody music always makes me overthink and worsens any negative thoughts that I have in my mind. Coupled with the fact that Duke University is an academically rigorous school and the coursework never stops, I just simply cannot balance out these thoughts with all the workload that I have and manage to be productive in a healthy way. Research backs this up; listening to mood-influencing music affects our Default Mode Network, brain regions that are active when the brain is at rest and not focused on the external environment — think of this as your brain being in “background mode”, and sad music can lead to more introspection. By no means am I discrediting seasonal depression. It’s very much a real thing. Not only that, research as published in Frontiers has shown that for some people, sad music can heighten sadness but also provide aesthetic enjoyment. However, I stand by my point that surrounding yourself with a dark and sad natural environment with even darker, sadder music may not be the solution to improving our mindsets. To raise a point, I ask that any Duke student feeling the negative vibes of seasonal depression play some EDM instead. Whether techno or house is your vibe, go for something energetic that has at least 120 beats per minute. I promise you that the lack of lyrics will keep you focused and that the (typically spoken) foreign language in the music will not distract you. As I type this very opinionated essay, I’m blasting some house in my headphones, and my fingers are flying across the keyboard. I’m not distracted by any lyrics, there’s a fast tempo that’s accelerating my typing, and I’m feeling focused without conflict of emotions. Sometimes, all you need is a good pick-me-up. Forget about “you are what you eat” — the new saying should be “you are what you listen to.” Kate Yeonjae-Jeong is a Trinity first-year. Her pieces typically run on alternating Tuesdays."
The fall of fluency,Anna Garziera,2024-11-19T13:00:00Z,Nov,19,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/fall-of-fluency-20241119.html,"Interview season is here: Graduating seniors are weighing jobs and post-grad options, juniors are contemplating internships and sophomores are considering enjoying one more summer at home. You might think whether you get the position depends on grades and extracurriculars. But what if it depended on how many times you said the word ""like""?I read an opinion article last summer that stuck with me. In his WSJ article, Tevi Troy describes one of the standards against which he measures prospective hires: their scores on the like-o-meter. On any given day, an outsider might think that Troy is conducting a normal interview. But he isn’t only listening for experience and ambition: ""I then make a hash mark every time the applicant uses the word 'like.' Too many and I’m already thinking about the next candidate,"" he writes.The first time I read his article, I thought his methods a little harsh. Certainly, there’s more to an employee than his eloquence during an interview. But my criticism stemmed from uneasiness: How many of my friends would pass his test? Would I pass myself? Sadly, as confident as I am that the Duke student population would be otherwise qualified, I don’t think many of us would get a satisfactory score on Troy’s like-o-meter.It’s easy to notice. Once we start counting the ""likes"" in each other’s speech, they’re hard to unhear. Some merely sprinkle their expression with ""likes"" — they’re an occasional slip. Others smother their speech with the verbal crutch like they might turkey with gravy. One can barely taste the meat anymore.In fact, ""like"" is not the only filler that we overuse. ""You know,"" ""so,"" ""well"" and ""very"" fall under the same category of vocal disfluencies.When used cautiously, these words can aid our speech: Without them, we’d sound robotic. But there’s a sweet spot we should try to land on. While drowning in fillers, we can’t expect to be articulate. And it isn’t just our generation that has this problem. Some of our professors have caught the same bug.It’s almost ironic. A professional relying on discourse markers to explain their subject is somewhat pitiful. Even at an elite university, we don’t expect lectures to feel like speeches. But we also shouldn’t have to put up with professors struggling to communicate in class. Really, it’s worse than them wearing jeans.Within the student population, I’ve noticed that we don’t only use fillers to supplement our lacking vocabulary. We also chronically steal phrases from each other’s mouths. It’s expected that such slang defines each generation. But we must not overdo it. When we only express ourselves through colloquialisms, we shrink our unique lexicon. I’m not the first to point out our shameless overuse of filler words — but not a lot of people are talking about it. Duke wants every class, starting with the Class of 2028, to be ""climate fluent."" How about we start with just becoming fluent?Some might argue that we should have bigger priorities. After all, there’d be no point in speaking fluently if we had no knowledge base. We’d have nothing to talk about.But we must ask ourselves this: Is getting the point across the only thing that matters? No. We should value elegance, efficiency and accuracy. We should want to convey each idea better and with fewer words. In fact, getting your point across is impossible if you don't have the word-stock. An argument is not convincing if it takes you ten minutes and your whole body, overwhelmed by gesticulation, to express yourself.What led to this deficiency? Society has seen several worrying trends in the past few decades. We read less, text more and don’t engage in debate and public speaking as much as we used to.But as opposed to other modern obstacles, the fall of fluency is something we can fix directly.If we want to speak more fluently, we only need to grow our vocabulary, brush up on our grammar and practice speaking in front of a crowd. We could try reciting famed speeches in front of the mirror and feel what it’s like to speak fluently. We could try to replicate President Kennedy’s tone in our everyday interactions. And the great thing with speech is that it’s fleeting. We can make mistakes. It doesn’t even have to be a hard commitment. For instance, we could start by tracking whenever we find it hard to explain something during a class discussion and later read up on the subject to reinforce our understanding. Next class, we could raise our hand and try again.But if we want to continue to indulge in more slack forms of speech when the stakes are low, we need to at least be able to flip the switch and speak fluently to our prospective employers — just in case their mental like-o-meters are running in the background.Anna Garziera is a Trinity sophomore.

Maybe I am entitled to an A,Umang Dhingra,2024-11-19T13:00:00Z,Nov,19,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/maybe-i-am-entitled-to-an-a-20241119.html,"It’s a time-honoured tradition. As soon as registration season rolls around, questions begin to plague conversations, social media and text threads across the Duke undergraduate student body — what is an easy NS/ALP class? Is there a way to bypass the foreign-language requirement? Which professors hand out free A’s? How we value the liberal arts education begins to quickly unravel as soon as we look at the Latin honours cut-offs and realise that unless we take filler classes, we have no shot at being named the academic cream of the crop come graduation. In my two years at Duke, I have heard many professors lament how undergraduate students strive for a good grade over the pursuit of knowledge for the sake of it, usually saying something along the lines of “an A doesn’t mean what it used to.” In a way, they’re not wrong. It stands to reason that when a grade, high or low, becomes the default, it doesn’t exactly mean much. But it becoming the default isn’t a folly of the students; it is a folly of the way the GPA system is structured in the first place. You can’t have a grade below an A even once in your undergraduate career if you want to graduate with a 4.0 — there is no “redeeming oneself.” To get an A is to earn little; to get anything below is to lose it. To that end, our professors are right in saying an A doesn't mean much anymore — probably because it’s no longer designed to be an accomplishment. As the A has simply become the way not to lose one’s GPA points, grade cutoffs for university-level honours have risen year after year, increasing pressure on students to make A’s and on faculty to give them. Furthermore, taking a small cut in a grade and landing an A- reduces one’s GPA, but working incredibly hard and getting an A+ adds nothing. We are punished for not being the very best in our class and not rewarded when we are. But maybe we shouldn’t care about our grades at all. After a certain point, most professional pathways certainly do not. Isn’t the point of coming to a school like Duke, that we want to be the best we can be? Then why must we lean on external metrics, like grades, to feel further validated in our worth? In some ways, that is the point of the Trinity curriculum (and all the work that goes into revamping it) — to challenge us to try new things. So why try to graduate with a 4.0 at all? When a singular measure of academic prowess unites us at this school, we are forced to hold onto it, whether or not it has any objective value. Students may be compelled to take on fewer challenging and/or interesting classes, fearing being outside their comfort zone might spell doom for their academic standing. It is hard to tell students not to care about their GPAs when departmental awards, membership in academic societies and university honours hinge on it. Our grading system defeats the very liberal arts model it claims to stand on.I don’t mean to portray students as cultural dupes only validated by grades and awards to make sense of their academic achievement. We’re not — we don’t simply want an excellent letter grade. Most of us grew up working incredibly hard to get the grades and accomplishments we did just to get our foot in the door at this university. My entitlement is not rooted in extrinsic markers of achievement, but rather from my hard work earning them. To that end, when I wait a few semesters to take a class with a professor who is a better grader, it is not just because I want a higher grade but also because I want to be in a learning environment where my hard work is valued; where learning is a meaningful, rewarding act; where my professor wants me to succeed. There is little escape — we work towards A’s and feel entitled to them, but it becomes difficult to reconcile with what that A means at all. Do I value it because it is a reward for my hard work, or it because I am terrified of the hit a bad grade will take on my GPA?Certainly, most people will concede that the GPA system is imperfect. But we should also question the extent of its flawed nature. GPAs and grades don’t just inaccurately represent someone’s academic prowess — maybe they changed their major! Maybe they had a bad semester! Maybe they just took a class in something wildly different from what they’re good at! — but every department has its own grading policies and each professor has their own curve. With few checks and balances in place, we are at the whim of our departments and professors. The extent of commitment that would yield a high grade in one class won’t cut it in another; irrespective of your motivation to excel, you simply might not be able to get an A. Grades and GPAs don’t often reflect the growth a student has experienced over the course of a class or their academic careers, rewarding never failing instead of rewarding failing and getting back up again.An A means very different things from one student to the next — when metrics like membership in Phi Beta Kappa or Latin Honors refuse to take into account these differences, we must ask if the grading system at large means anything at all. If we cannot find a strong answer to that, we should ask ourselves if there is merit to doing away with grades as a whole. Be that in defaulting to a pass-fail system or creating a new system altogether that emphasises feedback and individualised learning, breaking away from the GPA system might enable us to finally prioritise erudite for its very sake over arbitrary indicators of it.

Circus Fusion and three other classes you should take in the spring,Monday Monday,2024-11-18T13:00:00Z,Nov,18,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/circus-fustion-and-three-other-classes-20241118.html,"Editor's note: The article below is satire.Duke is unveiling its own ""Starbucks secret menu"" of classes, if you will.

I wanted to beat the University News section of The Chronicle to the punch and tell my loyal readers about the new offerings as soon as I found out.Equipped with two Red Bulls and a packet of peanut M&M’s, I combed through hundreds of classes so that you don’t have to, to find the new ones for you. While there were around 30 new listings, I picked out the top four that truly set Duke apart from other schools.How to Find It — A Study in Female Anatomy: GFS 169Friedl Building 107, MWF 1:25-3:55 p.m.Watching the last 10 minutes of ""Bridgerton"" Season 3, Episode 4, is the only homework students can expect before starting the course. Throughout the semester, students get to do case studies on the aforementioned ""Bridgerton"" or the bedroom scenes in ""Game of Thrones."" While lecture-based, this class will surely get your mind juices tingly!Additionally, the professor has warned the Wellness Center to expect more appointments after Unit 1, ""Knowing the Zones,"" is over. This class is a Gender Feminist Studies course.The Art of Being Funny: THEATRST 215Bryan Center 104, MWF 10:05-11:20 a.m.Ever find yourself blankly staring at someone and confused about why they’re not laughing at your joke about the claustrophobic astronaut? This professor has you covered. She’ll tell you if your jokes seem to be AI-generated, written by a corny dad, or from a Laffy Taffy wrapper. There will also be exercises in what situations are okay to laugh in and which are not. If you don’t know whether to laugh or not when someone trips and drops their plate of food, this is the class for you! And by the way, the astronaut just needed some space.Circus Fusion: PHYSEDU 699Wilson Recreation Center 125, MW 8:30-11 a.m.Pilates and Intro to Golf, prepare to be dethroned to Duke’s newest physical education class: Circus Fusion. This intensive exercise course will train students to ride unicycles, fire-breathe, and survive being shot out of a cannon. Duke tried to get an elephant for students to train, but a PETA person threatened to sue for animal abuse. While it is a grad-level class, undergraduate students can test in by juggling ten basketballs simultaneously.Applying General Education Requirements to Your Life: SOC 356Social Sciences Building 117, TTh 11:45 a.m.- 1 p.m.This class will help you figure out anything from how to apply ""Hamlet"" to your family relationships to how to use your sophomore research paper on ""why squirrels on college campuses are more aggressive than their forest counterparts"" to land a job on Wall Street. The professor promises to highlight how improper verb conjugation in your French class won’t prevent you from successfully ordering coffee in Paris. She also will show you how to use the periodic table in everyday settings.This course will have ten major essays throughout the semester to capture the essence of the busy work in a quintessential Gen Ed class.You’re welcome. Now, go get the Nutella Frappuccino from the Starbucks secret menu. It’s delicious.Monday Monday would like to inform pre-med students that the ""How to Find It"" course can now replace the required anatomy course. "
Generous pluralism at Duke,Luke A. Powery,2024-11-18T13:00:00Z,Nov,18,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/generous-pluralism-20241118.html,"During this year of celebration of Duke’s Centennial, believe it or not, I have become inspired by the Bylaws of Duke University. Like many universities, Duke has religious roots, which is not necessarily surprising for those who know the history of Christianity and higher education across the world. This is reflected in Article I of the bylaws, which says at its founding the University’s purposes were grounded ""in the Christian tradition of intellectual inquiry and service to the world."" This section on the ""aims"" of the university further notes ""the diverse constituency that has developed since its founding."" In explaining how its origins and current situation coalesce, the aims go on to say, ""The University is committed to creating a rigorous scholarly community characterized by generous hospitality toward diverse religious and cultural traditions.""These aims related to faith and diversity reflect who Duke strives to be. They are in the DNA of the institution and continue to manifest at Duke. It is an institution with an aim (also in the bylaws) of ""foster[ing] a lively relationship between knowledge and faith"" and also ""promot[ing] a respectful spirit of dialogue and understanding."" One research paper summarized Duke’s approach to religious life on campus this way: ""Thoughtful educators have long wrestled to strike an optimal balance between preserving the best of a common religious heritage, protecting intellectual freedom, and maximizing inclusivity in light of their present circumstances and perspectives.""One of the ways you can see this approach at work on campus today is during the Centennial event called ""We Believe,"" a multi-faith, two-day engagement with Duke’s various faith communities, which began yesterday (Nov. 17) and continues throughout today. This event will lead you into the heart of Duke’s ""diverse religious and cultural traditions."" Through joyful experiences, thought-provoking conversations, and moments of quiet reflection, this event invites all to connect with Duke's vibrant faith communities.You will have the opportunity to explore themes of Feasting and Fasting, Gathering and Departing and Sound and Silence — each inspired by practices from Duke's diverse religious traditions. With a Commonplace Book and Passport in hand, you’ll travel to various locations on campus, collecting stamps, recording reflections and engaging in meaningful encounters. From singing, listening, walking and praying to learning about food and farming, engaging a Sikh speaker, attending Catholic Mass, meeting a Muslim Chaplain, attending Hindu worship or Anglican-Episcopal morning prayer or Buddhist meditation, participants will taste and see the multiplicity of religious expression on campus.It will reveal the present religious pluralism that is at Duke University. No single religious or cultural tradition is identical, so particularity makes up the plurality. To be plural does not mean uniform. It means differentiation but that doesn’t mean difference has to be demonized. That isn’t the Duke way. Difference or diversity, even religiously or faith-wise, is embraced as a reality of the world of which Duke is a part.“We Believe” celebrates 100 years of diverse religious expression on campus and demonstrates that it is possible — to quote the bylaw’s aims one more time — ""to promote a respectful spirit of dialogue and understanding; to discourage all partisan and sectarian strife.” The array of religious traditions reflects the university’s historic motto — ""Eruditio et Religio"" or Knowledge and Religion—in our time and the importance of faith and spirituality in the lives of students in particular, but most certainly among faculty, staff, administrators and alumni as well. In a pluralistic environment, we don’t have to believe the same thing, but it is clear that we all believe something.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel.

Duke needs a Jewish movement in solidarity with Palestinian liberation,"Eli Meyerhoff, Bindu Thota, Abi Human, Matthew Slayton",2024-11-15T13:00:00Z,Nov,15,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/duke-needs-jewish-solidarity-movement-20241115.html,"There is an old Jewish saying, ""two Jews, three opinions,” which implies that intelligent debate is a core value of Jewish culture. In Duke’s official Jewish space, Jewish Life at Duke (JLD), the opinions of anti-Zionist and non-Zionist Jewish students are marginalized. JLD, ""the hub for all things Jewish on Duke’s campus,"" is fully accredited by Hillel International, which imposes guidelines that significantly narrow the political perspectives that affiliates like JLD can platform. Non- and anti-Zionist Jewish students have challenged Hillel through what was originally named the Open Hillel movement, which was founded at Swarthmore College a decade ago. At Duke today, our work is a continuation of this movement — which occurred at more than 60 universities — where Jewish students resisted and attempted to bend Hillel into becoming more accepting of anti-Zionist perspectives. Hillel's reaction — dating back to the beginning of these efforts — was to attempt to curb the movement through threatened legal action. In response to legal pressure, the broader resistance to Hillel changed its name to Judaism On Our Own Terms, of which our group at Duke is a chapter. Zionist organizations dominate Jewish students’ options for engaging in Jewish community on Duke’s campus, making Duke into ""a bastion of pro-Israel activism."" Neither the Duke administration nor any other group currently provides resources, such as space, staff or funding, to support people at Duke who practice traditions of Jewishness that are alternative and opposed to Zionism. There is a pressing need for Duke to foster a community that accepts diasporic Jewish alternatives, particularly the tradition of seeing Jewish safety as actualized through solidarity with other marginalized peoples. Such alternatives are opposed to the Zionist vision of Jewish safety that is imagined to be realized through an ethno-nationalist state like Israel, in which pursuing the promise of Jewish security has resulted in continued violence against Palestinian people. Against Zionist dominance, we must build a movement of collective liberation and safety through solidarity that will not tolerate Israel’s ongoing devastation of Palestine and Lebanon. Jewishness and antisemitism are politically contested concepts. Our understandings of emancipatory Jewish traditions, our personal experiences and our studies of academic work on these topics influence our approach to these topics. By contrast, the dominant approach at JLD is to hide their Zionist political position behind a veneer of objectivity. JLD claims to represent all Jews at Duke while covertly pushing Zionist programming, such as its ""Antisemitism 101 Training."" Hillel, both at Duke and nationwide in concert with a network of ""astroturf"" Zionist organizations, presents materials from biased advocacy organizations (such as the Anti-Defamation League) as authoritative while failing to integrate the wealth of academic research that presents contrasting views. Thereby, these organizations are spreading a moral panic about Jewish feelings of discomfort and fear and conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, which, as Judith Butler argues, serves ""the purposes of extreme censorship, for it constrains those who oppose ongoing Israeli violence, the killing of [possibly more than 186,000 Gazans], from expressing moral and political outrage and defending fundamental principles of free expression and political justice.""Zionism as a political movement was founded at The First Zionist Congress, convened by Theodor Herzl in 1897. Zionism frames antisemitism as an inevitable, eternal hatred. It responds to this threat by seeking Jewish safety through building a settler-colonial, ethno-nationalist state modeled on European masculinist and militarist forms of nationalism. The Zionist founders referred to their project as one of colonization (e.g., Vladimir Jabotinsky spoke of ""the colonisation of Palestine,"" noting that there is no precedent for ""any colonisation being carried on with the consent of the native population”; also, Zionist organizations key to Israel’s foundation had ""colonial"" in their names, such as the Jewish Colonisation Association and the Jewish Colonial Trust). Zionism relies on a reactionary form of solidarity in which Jews protect other Jews at the expense of others' safety, particularly Palestinians whose land and lives they have dispossessed.An opposing political tradition of Jewishness, the Jewish Labor Bund, was also founded in 1897. Instead of fighting fascism head-on, many Zionist leaders co-opted antisemitism to promote Jewish emigration to Palestine. The Bund condemned the Zionists’ defeatism and escapism. In contrast, the Bund diagnosed antisemitism as a historical, political, resolvable problem and responded to the problem by embracing diasporism. Through the principle of doikayt or “here-ness,” they saw wherever they lived in the diaspora as their home, and fought there alongside other marginalized peoples for equality, justice and liberation for all, creating Jewish safety through transformative solidarity. In addition to the Bund, the US has a long history of many organizations that built anti-Zionist Jewish alternative movements, continuing through the present movement for justice in Palestine.Antisemitism is a specific, historically produced political project. Antisemitism’s historical roots are in European Christianity. From earlier Christian-supremacist demonization of Jews, such as through the ""blood libel"" myth, antisemitism has evolved into conspiracy theories that deflect people’s anger about their oppression away from the ruling class and toward a scapegoat of ""the Jews,"" imagined as an all-powerful, evil cabal against whom they can ""punch up.""Antisemitism is intertwined with other forms of oppression. White supremacists promote conspiracy theories about how Jews are supposedly promoting racial equality and immigration as a means of ""destroying the white race."" Anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ movements use antisemitic conspiracy theories about malevolent elites conspiring to overwhelm the borders of the nation-state and to defile the traditional Western boundaries of gender, sexuality and family. We believe that the only way to respond to antisemitism is through an intersectional approach that builds solidarities across movements for dismantling these oppressive systems. In doing so, we aim to continue liberatory traditions of solidarity between particular Jewish and non-Jewish communities. For example, in the 1920s, working-class Jews in New York City established cooperative housing, reserving apartments for Black families, protesting anti-Black housing discrimination and building a kindergarten to support working mothers. Recently, Jews have protested ICE and border camps under the principle of ""never again."" Anti-Zionist and non-Zionist Jews have organized in intersectional solidarity by reckoning with our multiple complicities with settler colonialism — building relationships of solidarity with Native American and Indigenous Palestinian peoples against the U.S. occupation of Turtle Island and the U.S.-supported Zionist colonization of Palestine. Inspired by those who have taken up the emancipatory values of Jewish and other movement traditions, we seek to follow in their footsteps in the place where we live. In Durham, Jewish well-being has been bound to the freedom struggles of others in the American South. During the Civil Rights Movement, while some Jewish people took the side of the segregationists and others were indifferent to Black people’s struggles, many Jewish people organized in solidarity with Black people. Some Jewish students engaged in civil disobedience, such as Joseph Tieger, a Duke graduate who was arrested twenty-three times protesting for desegregation. After he and a half-dozen Jewish students were arrested for a sit-in that blocked traffic, the judge who sentenced him to jail said that he had ""the dubious distinction of having the most arrests in Orange County"" for civil rights. We hope to follow in their example.To support the creation of an alternative, non-Zionist and anti-Zionist, diasporic Jewish community, we have formed a new group: Duke Jewish Solidarity Movement. We are students, staff, faculty and alumni, including Jews and non-Jews. Our group continues emancipatory traditions of Jewishness, intertwined with other liberatory movements. We commit to liberatory values, which we interpret in new ways as we study and practice them through organizing. We take inspiration from past and current Jewish movements that act in coalition for collective safety and liberation. Jewish groups like IfNotNow, Jewish Voice for Peace (including its Triangle chapter) and Breaking the Silence are refusing the assumption that Jewish safety requires the oppression of Palestinian people. We are affiliated with one such group, Judaism On Our Own Terms, a network that seeks to empower Jewish communities that are ""both in solidarity with all oppressed and colonized communities across the world and radically inclusive of many different notions of, experiences with, and ways of relating to Judaism.""We see our movement for justice bound up with decolonization as a transnational movement across Palestine, Turtle Island and other settler-colonial situations. In Durham, we aim to organize with Duke NAISA, the Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation, Duke SJP, Duke ASJP, Duke Divest Coalition and others, helping to build solidarity across movements for decolonization. With doikayt in mind, we ask how we should be present at Duke, with each other, in solidarity and common cause with others.Abi Human, Bindu Thota, Eli Meyerhoff, and Matthew Slayton are representatives of the Duke Jewish Solidarity Movement."
Leaving your room 101: A homebody’s guide to West Campus study spaces ,Valentina Garbelotto,2024-11-14T23:00:00Z,Nov,14,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/111424-garbelotto-study-spaces-20241114.html,"I’ve always found solace in the familiar four walls of my room. It was my non-negotiable study space, complete with my desk, a comfy chair, a heating pad, a familiar view and the perfect combination of stillness and solitude. It was predictable and cozy. I could control my space, my surroundings and my productivity. Or so I thought.It hit me this year, amid bouts of frustration over my stagnant study habits, that maybe I was too comfortable. My room had become my security blanket — too familiar and filled with distractions. The predictability of my surroundings was draining my motivation, leaving me restless. Boredom was frequent, even amidst the stress of self-imposed busyness. I would open my laptop to study, but time slipped away as I mindlessly clicked through social media, searching for a spark of inspiration that never came. Every attempt to study felt like a reminder of how stuck I was — in a cage of my own making. I was missing out on the world around me — the buzz of campus, the discovery of new environments and the energy of shared spaces. I remember discussing my fear of studying outside my room with my dad. I told him how every place made me feel uncomfortable, how I felt eyes on me at all times even though everyone’s in their own world, how every day my single became even more unproductive. I told him that my self-consciousness was running wild and that it didn’t help that it’s so easy to give into the temptation of laying in bed with no roommate around. He proposed that I study somewhere I was familiar with, and I knew just the spot (though it’s not your typical study setting). A few weeks before, my friend and I took our laptops out on the second floor of WU after dinner. Since eating together at WU was a part of my routine, I was comfortable enough to get work done there. As someone who thrives on background noise, I found the environment calming and aesthetically pleasing, too. So I decided this was the place I’d go back to — alone.The moment I sat down at a table near the large windows, I felt a bit of that familiar discomfort creeping in — my mind racing with thoughts of people noticing me. But, as I got to work, I slowly started to relax. The hum of conversation, the clatter of keyboards and the rustling of papers grounded me. The more I focused on my work, the less I noticed the people around me. When I finally packed up to leave, I was struck by how productive I'd been. It turns out, I didn’t need a “perfect” little nook to get things done — I just needed to let go of the fear of being observed. Stepping outside my comfort zone has never been a one-time decision, but rather a series of small, intentional choices that gradually make me more open to change.As I packed my bag each morning, I grabbed my emotional-support items — headphones, chapstick and my favorite chocolate-covered pretzels. Then, I picked a study spot that mirrored the comfort of my dorm — a quiet corner in the Link, a secluded spot in the Carpenter Reading Room — a space where I didn’t feel so out of place. After a few months, I became comfortable studying in these places, giving me the much-needed boost of confidence to explore the rest of campus.My desire to not miss out on the college campus experience now outweighed my fear of exploring new places, and so began my journey exploring West Campus. I wandered through buildings I’d been in but never studied in, like the Wellness Center, where the mix of soothing spaces and scattered piano notes made for a place too relaxing to focus. I found myself visiting a friend in the Gothic Reading Room, but the quiet felt judgmental — I was afraid to sneeze. Each time I studied somewhere new, I took note of how the environment made me feel — was I productive or distracted? Anxious or relaxed? I began to refine what worked for me and let go of the places that didn’t serve me. At first, the thought of studying anywhere but my room felt like a chore, but as I kept at it, I started to see each new spot as an opportunity, not an obligation. These days, studying outside my room feels natural, and my single is simply my bedroom — nothing more.We spend so much time studying we might as well choose a spot that makes it a tiny bit more enjoyable. If fear is holding you back from that, take it one step at a time: start with a place that's comfortable for you. And, if you need some inspiration, I've curated a list of five spaces that might just suit your preferences.For those looking for peace & quiet: the LinkThe Link’s futuristic setup almost makes you feel like you’re in a sci-fi movie scene. It’s functional, sterile even, but it’s perfect for laser-focused work sessions. There’s minimal distraction and it feels a bit disconnected from reality, so it’s easy to lose track of time. When I need to immerse myself in a project in the wee hours of the morning, this place delivers.A romantic café feel: WU Second FloorIf my study life were a college rom-com, the WU 2nd Floor would be the cozy, late-night coffee shop where I (the protagonist) cram for finals while sipping her tea. The intimate, social vibe has just enough background noise to feel like you're part of something. It’s cozy without feeling confining and, as someone who used to step into shared spaces with caution, the low-pressure, welcoming atmosphere made the transition surprisingly easy. (Other cafés I enjoy: Twinnie’s, Zwelli’s and Vondy.)For the gym-goers: Wilson GymYou might be thinking, “What the hell? What kind of study space is a gym?” But trust me when I say Wilson is drastically underrated. The rhythmic beats of feet tapping on the treadmills will put you in a trance. It’s the perfect place to get work done after a workout. Side note: It’s typically on the cooler side so I always bring a hoodie. Wilson has a comforting consistency that balances my craving for familiarity with a refreshing change of scenery. For those with claustrophobia: Bostock and Perkins BridgeThe bridge between Bostock and Perkins on the 3rd floor holds an airy, light-filled atmosphere. The open setup and the natural light give it a fresh, unboxed feel that inspires me to work. You’ll likely catch me here, hot cocoa from Vondy café in hand, as I attempt to tackle my to-do list. Something about studying beside the huge windows feels expansive, as though I’m finally breaking free from the mental walls that held me back in my room. For those who need couches: Carpenter Reading RoomThe Carpenter Reading Room is what I imagine an ideal study spot to look like — wood-paneled walls, old couches and natural light flooding in. It’s quiet but not overly formal, and the couches make for a comfy change from the standard study desk. Here, I’ve found my middle ground: It’s comfortable without making me too comfortable and quiet without the silence feeling oppressive. It’s truly the little alcove I’ve always craved. (For the upperclassmen: Keohane 4E’s lobby also has an abundance of couches to sprawl on for lengthy reading sessions.)Here are my honorable mentions: the Edge (beautiful views), Sanford staircase balconies, Grainger Hall conference rooms and the Fuqua library (low-key prettier than Perkins — although you’ll have to bribe a grad student to get in).If you’re still feeling too anxious to leave the comfort of your room, I recommend starting with LifeAt.io. The site lets you view recordings of study spaces ranging from cafés to libraries and cityscapes. Whenever I hear the background noise of NYC, I’m instantly in focus mode, just like lo-fi, jazz or classical might do for others. But if you’re willing to give this experiment a try, go for it! Even if it means stepping into unfamiliar places or adjusting to minor discomforts at first. In the end, breaking out of my room freed me from more than just walls — it freed me from routines that no longer served me and helped me experience the beauty of Duke.Valentina Garbelotto is a Trinity junior.

Beyond the stained glass,Arya Krishnan,2024-11-13T13:00:00Z,Nov,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/111324-krishnan-beyond-stained-glass-20241113.html,"You may have noticed that tall, pointy stone building in the middle of campus, right behind the bus stop. It seems to be something of a phenomenon. Day after day, students and visitors gather around it for the perfect photo opportunity — some even bring an entire camera crew just to get this gorgeous monument in the background.The Duke Chapel is clearly a big deal. I understood some of the hype: Its imposing scale, intricate stone carvings and majestic windows are stunning. But even with its beauty, I felt that there had to be more to it than just the architecture. Why was this chapel smack dab in the middle of a globally acclaimed academic institution? What was it built for? There had to be a story and significance beneath that aesthetic exterior.So, one day, spurred by the spirit of exploration, I decided to find out. I pushed open the heavy wooden doors at the Chapel’s entrance and ventured inside. A kind gentleman offered to give me a tour, and as we walked through the building, I learned that the building’s intricacies ran deep. Every aspect of it was designed with careful intention, steeped in cultural tradition and filled with rich symbolism.As we walked down the nave, the guide shared stories about the materials used in its construction. The pews weren’t made from any ordinary wood — they were crafted from the trees cleared to build the university, connecting those seated on them to the land Duke stands on and grounding the Chapel in both nature and tradition. Though the exterior stone was from a local quarry, blocks of the highest-quality limestone were imported from Bedford, Indiana, to construct the interior. One can quite literally feel the effect this has — run your hands across the intricate stone carvings inside the Chapel and you’ll be amazed by its flawless purity and smoothness. There even used to be a railroad line cutting right through what is now our main quad — James B. Duke had it built all the way to the Chapel’s doorstep solely to shuttle the stone for its construction. I’d argue that the experience of the Chapel is even more beautiful with your eyes closed. After all, the building has a functional purpose — cultivating an environment conducive to worship, meditation and music. The high arches and carefully engineered stonework amplify sound in a way that makes each note resonate and linger, giving the music a rich and ethereal quality. I sing in the chapel choir, so trust me when I say the experience is like nothing else.I couldn’t sit with my eyes shut all day, so I turned my attention to the gorgeous stained-glass windows. At first glance, they were visual delights, gleaming in the afternoon sunlight with their deep, mellow colors. My guide then explained the significance behind the aesthetics. The stained glass portrays over a hundred Bible stories, yet it also holds what my guide called Easter eggs — little hidden surprises that connect past to present. In the panel of “Adam and Eve,” for example, Adam holds a 20th-century shovel, reminding us of his role as a gardener in Eden. Then there’s the window depicting “Noah’s Ark,” which features unexpected “exotic” animals like a yellow turtle, a green iguana, and a brown monkey — animals one may not traditionally associate with the story. A careful observer might also spot something else unusual: the names of some of the glassworkers, embedded as tiny signatures in the glass.It turns out this last detail was controversial. Religious stained glass is traditionally done “Deo Gloria” — for the glory of God alone — without crediting the artists. When the head designer, Owen Bonnawit, discovered that his workers had slipped in their names, he was livid. He fired them on the spot and burned all of their drafts. It wasn’t until decades later that a master’s student studied the glass and uncovered the hidden stories and meanings woven into each window.My tour ended, but the impact of the experience lasted with me. The Chapel had been hiding in plain sight all this time. I glance at it every day, yet it took me this long to realize it was a treasure trove of art, culture, and tradition. This discovery got me thinking: What else am I missing? What other parts of this campus, or even my life, am I simply overlooking?As college students, we’re so focused on the grind, so caught up in working through assignments and preparing for exams that we often ignore the rich surroundings calling for us to take a closer look. We talk about FOMO — a fear of missing out — albeit usually regarding social events or career opportunities. Standing on those chapel steps, I realized I was experiencing a different kind of FOMO — on history, knowledge and beauty that was right under my nose. I had work to get back to — readings, problem sets, midterms to study for. But I found myself wondering where our duties as students really lie. Is it in grinding through another assignment, or in exploring the world around us, digging into stories and legacies embedded in our environment?It’s worth taking a break from the grind. Don’t worry about falling behind — I found that curiosity and inquisitiveness can actually serve our academic pursuits. What began as a detour became a cornerstone of my coursework — inspired by my chapel tour, I shot a documentary-interview of the Chapel’s stained glass for one of my courses. Not only did I gain practical skills through this project, but it also gave me the chance to have fun exploring something that fascinates me. We’re so indoctrinated in this culture of binge-writing an essay the night it’s due and then wiping it out of our memory the next day. This practice is a wasted opportunity. Coursework can always become something that resonates with you, rather than a token for a grade. All it took was a single conversation with a tour guide that opened up an entire avenue of exploration, learning and even filmmaking. Being open to conversations and interactions with others will fundamentally change our academic journey. We’re not navigating this campus alone; we’re part of a community of knowledge, perspectives and stories begging to be shared. Make that effort to connect with those around you — talk to your professors, your classmates, all the people who make up this campus. And if you’re an introvert like me, don’t worry — there’s always a friendly extrovert, like my tour guide, ready to swoop in and spark a conversation that might just captivate you.

The tragedy of the tragedy ,Aaron Siegle,2024-11-11T13:00:00Z,Nov,11,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/111124-siegle-tragedy-of-tragedy-20241111.html,"A good share of my classes this semester have begun the same way — with what is now known by the students in my program as ""the graph of death."" The graph is deathly for both its implications and the outrageous number of times it has appeared before my eyes from lectures and guest speakers. The graph depicts the growth of global capture fisheries and aquaculture, the controlled cultivation of aquatic organisms. Production of seafood is depicted on the x-axis along with time on the y-axis. The output from capture fisheries begins to plateau in the 1980s as fish stocks become chronically depleted but global seafood production continues to grow, with the difference filled by aquaculture. The implications of the figure are clear — once humans exploit one resource, they move onto the next best alternative. And this lesson isn’t just confined to fisheries management. Every scientific field has its own ""graph of death,"" whether it be an oil reserves graph for energy, the famous ""hockey stick"" graph in climate science, or a species extinction curve in conservation biology. All the graphs tell essentially the same story: Things are going quite poorly for the environment and humans are at fault.This narrative is the core element of the ""tragedy of the commons,"" a theory stating that individuals acting in their own self-interest will deplete a public resource. While the tragedy of the commons is certainly experienced in societies around the world, its simplistic explanation of environmental problems serves as an intellectual crutch that impedes scientists from analyzing our greatest challenges more critically and holistically. We need to reach beyond the tragedy of the commons to develop sustainable solutions that can be adapted to the needs of communities and the unique ways in which they interact with the environment. The tragedy of the commons was popularized by ecologist Garrett Hardin who used the metaphor of sheep grazing on a common pasture to convey how natural resources are depleted. If each herd is allowed to graze on the meadow as much as they want, then soon the field will become completely denuded of vegetation, thus rendering it useless for all parties involved. Though an individual sheep cannot destroy the field alone, the cumulative impact of all the sheep exploiting the same resource ultimately destroys it. In the same way, even if one person’s emissions do not significantly impact climate change, the aggregate emissions of humanity have major consequences. Hardin’s theory took off because it was elegant, broadly applicable and easy to understand. The tragedy of the commons paradigm initiated a 50-year research spree on the study of common pool resources, a topic that was previously ignored by academics. The appeal of this framework is that it provides a standardized depiction of the status quo to which researchers can apply their ideas, just like how builders need to flatten the ground before they can construct a house. However, the simplicity that made the theory so successful is also what disconnects it from reality. Resource dilemmas are not like flat land, so to speak; each situation is unique.Hardin assumes that humans, when acting in their own self-interest, will take actions that harm or deplete the environment. But what if self-serving desires end up improving environmental conditions?For example, take renewable energy development. The primary goal of any solar and wind company is to maximize profit. In the process of doing so, they are displacing fossil fuel generation, which is instrumental in mitigating climate change. The same can be said for many other activities, such as beekeeping, shellfish aquaculture and teaching. Individuals acting their own self-interest partake in these activities and even make careers out of them. In doing so, they provide environmental benefits such as pollination, water purification and increased awareness about the environment. Self-interested motives do not always equal environmental destruction.Another flaw in the tragedy of the commons is that it assumes the actors involved have relatively short time horizons. It supposes that individuals are optimizing for the maximum short-term yield, not longevity. Revisiting the classic sheep example, Hardin presumes that all the shepherds will allow their sheep to graze unrestrained, causing the resource to collapse. However, if the shepherds planned on enhancing their flocks for the next ten years, not just for this season, then they would not push the commons to the brink. This appears to be a perfectly rational idea, but our modern era of casino capitalism has hardwired short term gain into our psyche, suppressing any notions of delayed gratification or planning ahead. So, in this sense the tragedy of the commons is correct. Short term thinking has its consequences. But that doesn’t mean human actions are only governed by our immediate desires. In fact, there are many examples of communities sustainably managing common pool resources. Nobel-prize winning Economist Elinor Ostrom assembled a host of evidence that communities can successfully manage finite resources if they create clearly-defined use boundaries and implement robust conflict resolution mechanisms. These qualities were most commonly found in rural and indigenous communities, which were defined by high levels of internal trust and collective stewardship. Similarly, political economist Mancur Olson found that small groups are much more effective at managing collective resources because each individual was more likely to share common interests with each other. Nevertheless, big groups can still effectively govern the commons if members are adequately motivated to do so. While the tragedy of the commons is useful in explaining challenges in environmental management at a high level, it needs to be expanded upon to drive sustainable change and acknowledge the success stories in common pool resource management. If we are to accommodate a growing middle class while also averting a climate disaster, we need to stop thinking about environmental challenges as a zero-sum game, as they are portrayed in the tragedy of the commons. Energy efficiency, recycling and insightful planning will allow us to support more people without compromising the environment.Unfortunately, environmental science has become a field defined by pessimism. The tragedy of the commons only adds to this sentiment while ignoring many successful attempts at managing common resources without resorting to privatization. Though we must be candid about the immense challenges facing our environment, we also must not underestimate our ability to solve these challenges.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity junior.

Is my algorithm transphobic? And other questions for the algorithm,Nik Narain,2024-11-08T13:00:00Z,Nov,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110824-narain-is-my-algorithm-transphobic-20241108.html,"I spent a lot of time on trans YouTube this year. Like, a lot. In the dark periods of navigating transition, I found solace in these brief, 10-minute clips about embarrassing coming out stories, cultural approach to gender, hormone replacement therapy — the list goes on. There’s something deeply magical about knowing that some stranger across the world has gone through the same thing you have, especially when finding that source of resonance in your immediate surroundings can feel impossible.But the more I found myself on trans YouTube, and LGBTQ+ YouTube in general, the more I found myself surrounded by blatant queerphobic rhetoric. As in, the more I tried to look for information about LGBTQ+ topics, the more I found my For You page on YouTube suddenly full of armchair activists weighing in on the “trans debate”; therapists encouraging what is essentially a diluted form of conversion therapy and news anchors “roasting woman with pronouns.” And this, of course, is in addition to the hateful comments section of many videos covering any sort of LGBTQ+ related content, especially on short-form content like YouTube reels, notorious for pushing transphobic and misogynistic rhetoric.Now believe me, I’m all for seeing both sides to a debate, but also the existence of LGBTQ+ people isn’t a debate. If search algorithms are so well known for contributing to polarization, why is the case different for this topic? After all, polarization is incredibly common for transphobic content, with several online users and LGBTQ+ content creators reporting this phenomenon on various media platforms. As one user tweeted, “I tried out YouTube Shorts recently and I counted 25 transphobic shorts in the span of half an hour of scrolling. Not a single pro-trans one.”Prominent LGBTQ rights organization GLAAD recently released its fourth annual Social Media Safety Index (SMSI), the leading analysis of anti-LGBTQ online hate and disinformation. In partnership with Ranking Digital Rights (RDR) and Goodwin Simon Strategic Research (GSSR), GLAAD developed a Scorecard to quantitatively evaluate a media platform’s commitment to protecting LGBTQ+ people. This included evaluating the platform’s anti-harassment policies (such as deadnaming, misgendering and online violence), accessibility around integrating pronoun options in user profiles, internal structures to promote LGBTQ+ inclusion within its workplace amongst other things. Out of the six platforms analyzed (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Threads, YouTube, and X), five platforms received an F, which GLAAD representatives called “abysmal” in their report. TikTok was the only company that received a D+, a slight step-up from its competitors. As prominent vlogger Hank Green tweeted, “TikTok definitely remains better than Shorts at not randomly showing me transphobic/misogynistic content just because I like science stuff and video game clips. It’s like ‘we’ve noticed you like physics, might I interest you in some men’s rights?'”Important to note, the measures included in this report were only centered on the companies’ inclusion of anti-harassment policies, but not their enforcement,an even larger confounding variable around online homophobia and transphobia. Because even though TikTok, for example, has strict policies around deadnaming and misgendering, we all know that thousands of people are clearly not following it. Unfortunately, enforcement is notoriously difficult to study methodologically, so information around this is currently unavailable.According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), from 2022-23, more than 350 anti-LGBTQ incidents of hate and extremism in the US were counted. This includes acts of harassment, like bomb threats and protests; acts of vandalism, like graffiti and arson; and acts of physical assault. 138 incidents were specifically targeted towards drag events and performers, 33 toward schools and educators, 23 towards healthcare facilities and providers and 22 towards government buildings and elected officials. These incidents obviously don’t occur in a vacuum and are strongly influenced by anti-LGBTQ radicalization and sensationalization through media. As GLAAD President Kate Ellis writes, “As we have seen over and over again — there is a direct line from dangerous online rhetoric and targeting to violent offline behavior against the LGBTQ community. Sadly, we also see — over and over again — how social media companies refuse to enforce their own rules to protect LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups, despite their assertions that hate speech, bullying, and harassment are not allowed on their platforms.As profit margins of major media companies continue to rise, coined by the GLAAD report as the “Anti-LGBTQ Hate Industrial Complex,” the deprioritization and often ignorance towards ensuring the safety and wellbeing of its users will only grow more alarming. The SMSI recommends multiple policy solutions for tackling anti-LGBTQ+ harassment, such as including explicit policies towards LGBTQ+ protection on the platform, implementing policies around deadnaming and misgendering that don’t just involve self-reporting, disclosing company progress around meeting its own diversity and equity goals and showing greater commitment towards addressing the wrong demonetization and removal of LGBTQ users and their content. Finally, GLAAD urges media companies to ensure that all users have a freedom of self-expression on the apps and have a clear understanding of how information regarding their sexuality and gender identity will be handled.Online platforms have long been safe spaces for queer people around the world, especially for those in places where anything outside cis-heteronormativity is stigmatized and/or criminalized. It’s frustrating and often dehumanizing when the places in which you try to seek refuge are perpetually attacked by anyone from self-proclaimed alphas “destroying transgenderism” to scientists who rely on faulty methodologies to promote harmful ideas about one’s very existence. I hope for greater accountability from media giants to prioritize inclusion and reducing online anti-LGBTQ violence. Until then, I’ll dislike as many hate posts as I find and make fun of them to my friends.Nik Narain is a Trinity senior. His column runs on alternating Saturdays."
A selfish victory: The policy possibilities of a Trump victory,Advikaa Anand,2024-11-08T13:00:00Z,Nov,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110824-anand-policy-possibilities-trump-20241108.html,"I remember the day after Trump’s first election. It was the first election that captured my attention; the first time mainstream politics trickled into my life. I sat glued to the TV screen that night, my twelve-year-old heart not pulled in any particular direction. But the next day, when I went to school, the sky was overcast. Low clouds hung heavy over my home state of Mississippi, and a small voice spoke to me with ominous words: Nothing would ever be the same again.In the coming days and months, my intuition came alive. In keeping with his preposterous campaign promises, Trump instituted a ban denying citizens from several Muslim majority countries, triggered a 2018 government shutdown by demanding federal funding for a border wall and left the nation on the brink of nuclear war for several days by escalating tensions with Iran.These early indications of disastrous policy paled in comparison to his moral conduct later in his presidency: he was impeached twice, once because he attempted to pressure Ukraine into launching an investigation against Biden and again, as his callous words incited an insurrection against the just and peaceful transition of administrations.Time and time again, Trump has proved that he is morally and intellectually unfit for the highest position of power in the United States. And today, in the early hours of Wednesday morning, he coasted to victory. What was supposed to be a fraught and tense battle extending over multiple days concluded quickly as Trump took key swing states, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. The doomful conclusion was clear to me before I went to bed that night, but I coaxed myself into believing a miracle was possible. The day after, I woke up with a sickness in my stomach. The whole day, I walked around with my heart sinking to my feet. Because, you see, this reality in which Trump was reelected was inconceivable to me. It was inconceivable that my fellow citizens would choose a man who had repeatedly disgraced women, people of color, immigrants, people with disabilities and so many more. The mark of a capable leader is not one who exults in their power over those who are socially and systemically weaker than them but one who works actively to lift such individuals up through policies that chip away at biased institutions. But now this is my awful reality. This is our awful reality in which our chosen leader mocks reporters with disabilities and boasts about sexually assaulting women. And in his policies, he acts upon his character. Today, I read Project 2025, a political mandate published by the conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation. Although the document has not been explicitly endorsed by former President Trump and the Trump campaign has worked to distance itself from its pillars, its tenets offer a glimpse into what kinds of policies may be enacted in a second Trump term. In fact, ""a line by line review by CBS News identified 270 proposals in Project 2025’s published blueprint for the next Republican president that match Trump’s past policies and current campaign promises.""Some of these policies are in keeping with the typical conservative agenda: “less federal intervention in education and more support for school choice; work requirements for able-bodied, childless adults on food stamps; and a secure border with increased enforcement of immigration laws, mass deportations and construction of a border wall.” But others present a dark and dystopian reality evocative of""The Handmaid’s Tale.""Project 2025 calls for the FDA to ""reverse its 24-year old approval of the widely used abortion pill mifepristone.” Additionally, “the policy book also recommends the Justice Department enforce the Comstock Act [an] 1873 law [that] prohibits drugs, medicines, or instruments used in abortions from being sent through the mail.""Anti-reproductive health laws only scratch the surface of the contents of Project 2025. Its agenda ""not only recommends finishing the wall along the US-Mexico border, but urges the next administration to 'take a creative and aggressive approach' to responding to drug cartels at the border.""In 2024, these are the ideals the American democracy has voted for. Rational explanations abound: Kamala Harris’ association with Biden and his poorly rated policies, historic inflation rates and a surprising underperformance among Black and Latino voters. But every one of them pales in comparison to the raw truth: American democracy has spoken, and it has shown how a majority of Americans voted in accordance with interests that seemed to personally benefit them, while opening the floodgate for policies that would jeopardize the liberties of their fellow citizens. A love for a freedom that is only limited to you and your few is not a love for freedom at all; it is an affection for privilege. Yet, like the light slipping through the cracks between the clouds today, there remains hope. And the momentum amassed by the Harris campaign in such a short period of time serves as a testament to that hope. This fight for our rights is far from over; in fact, it has just begun. Now more than ever, it remains vital to remain an active participant in our democracy, casting votes in local elections and continuing to elevate our voices over a presidential regime that attempts to silence them through acts of quiet defiance, like my writing this article. There’s a lot about this election that is reminiscent of Trump’s defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016: his victory in crucial swing states, his victory over a woman and his maintenance of a lead throughout election night. But one thing is crucially different: We’ve been through this before. We know what’s coming. We know what we’re up against. And this time, though our hearts shrink in terror, we are ready.Advikaa Anand is a Trinity junior. Her columns typically run on alternating Tuesdays."
What do we watch now?,Sonia Green,2024-11-07T13:00:00Z,Nov,7,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110724-green-what-do-we-watch-now-20241107.html,"As a lover of film and television, I often find myself struggling to find something to watch. Movies in theaters feel uninteresting or often retell the same stories with a new cast. Television is no better with eight-episode seasons becoming the norm. This is after fans are expected to wait years to see more of their favorite characters. A few years ago, I decided to begin exploring 90s cinema. I wanted to get to know some of the films that my parents and so many others on the internet often reminisce about. I started with ""Poetic Justice"" and went on to watch the rest of what have now been affectionately termed ""hood films."" When I checked off most of those films from my list, I returned to today’s movies. The problem is that many of them lacked the impactful and emotional storytelling that drew me to cinema in the first case. Cinema today is full of remakes and retellings of stories we already know and love. This is great in theory, but how many times do we really want to watch the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" or another live-action remake of a Disney princess film, especially when we already know what will happen? Hollywood's approach to filmmaking is extremely flawed. Studios and producers have turned art into a formula and would rather retell the same stories or create films based on existing intellectual property (IP) instead of investing in new narratives. According to their ""formula,"" all they need to do is cast a popular actor or actress in a genre that has proven successful and audiences will flock to the show or film. ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a great example of this trend. This ""highly anticipated film"" ultimately lost Warner Bros. millions despite the fact that according to the Hollywood formula, it should have been a success. It’s based on DC Comics which has a built-in fanbase. Cast members such as Lady Gaga were supposed to draw fans to theaters, but that’s not what happened. This is not due to a lack of available content. About 50,000 screenplays are registered with the Writer’s Guild of America, so there is a plethora of new ideas out there. Screenwriting is one of the most difficult jobs out there, precisely because you never truly know what will sell or how your work will perform. These professionals make incredible sacrifices for their craft, often in the hopes of getting their “big break” one day. Out of these screenplays, the industry continues to pick based on formulas without considering the actual quality of storytelling. First of all, a film needs a plot. I have seen too many movies that have left me so confused at the end, that I couldn’t help but feel like I wasted two hours of my life. There also needs to be emotional depth. Audiences should feel something when they watch a film in theaters or at home. We need more than action movies that show pointless violence and destruction and rom-coms that are all about sex. We need cinema.Television is no different. I’ve noticed an alarming trend of executives canceling shows that we know and love in favor of continuing ones that we don’t, which leaves viewers confused. For example, I am a huge fan of 50 Cent’s ""Power"" cinematic universe which includes the namesake show ""Power"" and three, soon to be four, spinoffs. You can imagine my surprise when I learned that ""Power Book II"" was ending, which sent fans into an uproar. Another one of my favorite shows, ""All American: Homecoming"" (a spinoff of ""All American""), was canceled after its third season in favor of continuing ""All American"" even as most of the original cast has left.The solution to this problem is simple, but first, those in power need to recognize this lack of quality content as an issue. Storytelling and emotional appeal are no longer a priority. The plot is an afterthought. Films have become a profit generator as opposed to a medium to make an impactful statement about the world. I am not sure that those with the power to enact change will take my advice. I’m just a cinephile and aspiring screenwriter/director who is disappointed with my current options. This desire for quality content has led me to ask my parents and grandmother for movie suggestions instead of being excited about new releases.The entertainment industry is an industry that I dream of working in someday, but I often find myself wondering where my stories fit into a world that no longer sees the value in storytelling. How can I make movies that reflect what I want to see on screen when Hollywood executives are driven by fear? I worry that one day when my future children ask me for movie suggestions I’ll have nothing to give them. As the film and television capital of the world, I believe we can and must do better.Sonia Green is a Trinity senior. Her pieces typically run on alternate Thursdays. "
‭Tim Walz coming to Duke was momentous. If only we all could have seen him.‬,Cara Eaton,2024-11-07T13:00:00Z,Nov,7,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110724-eaton-if-only-all-see-walz-20241107.html,"Logistically, events often require an attendance cap. Deciding who can attend through a pre-organized‬ method — like having prospective attendees fill out a form — is logical and helps beat the chaos of the‬ day-of ticket rush. Not everyone can attend every event, and that’s okay.‬‭Tim Walz hosted a rally at Duke on Thursday, October 24. It was a momentous occasion heralded by‬ much excitement on campus. The attendees with whom I spoke afterward gave rave reviews. Yet,‬ throughout the day, most students said something else: “Yeah, I would’ve loved to see him, but I didn’t‬ know how.” A few even confided they didn’t know the event was happening.‬I knew it was happening, but I didn’t go. I learned about it through an‬‭ Instagram post‬‭ from the Duke‬ Democrats, the group responsible for the event. (Kudos to them, by the way, for successfully hosting a‬ vice presidential candidate — I commend the students involved.) To attend, you had to RSVP using a link,‬ reasonably so. However, a line in their post description paused me: “... you have to receive an invite to‬ attend after submitting the form.”‭What exactly is an “invite” in this context? Does it function just as a confirmation that you registered for‬ the event, or was it an invitation in the pure, selective sense? The fear of the latter could be enough to dissuade many people interested in attending from registering if they feel as if somehow they aren’t‬ qualified to go. An honest investigation into how these “invites” work is unimportant for the main point of‬ my argument; any vague suggestion of a selective process functions psychologically identically for‬ hesitant attendees as actual selection. So here was my predicament: I’m not a part of the Duke‬ Democrats or a party Democrat; the language around the event dissuaded me, but I would have loved to‬ see Tim Walz.‬Well, you could say, it is a rally, not merely a speaking event. Such things target dense crowds of‬ supporters, so it’s only natural to try to drum up such support here. Sure, that’s the platonic ideal of the‬ rally. In reality, political rallies accommodate anyone and everyone: opposition, questioning voters and‬ the casually interested citizen. Wouldn’t it be practical to use that model for our rally?‬‭Maybe event organizers were concerned that Walz would have to face hecklers. However, dealing with‬ protestors is part and parcel of being a politician. Campaigning in La Crosse, Wisconsin, earlier this month, Kamala Harris deftly responded to a pro-Trump heckler by replying, “You guys are at the wrong rally … I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street.” Career politicians are trained to‬ respond to hecklers and can even use them as an opportunity to display their wit and unflappability, as‬ Harris did. A Duke student, faculty member, or associate (invited or otherwise) likely doesn't exist who would insult or disturb Walz in a way he hasn’t already encountered. Besides, I’m reasonably confident‬ that the worst thing to happen to a candidate at a rally this election already transpired in July.‬For us unaffiliated outsiders, the method to screen those approved to attend the rally is unclear (as is, to‬ be clear, the existence of any screening process). If “invites” were decided by actual membership in the‬ Duke Democrats, by word-of-mouth association, or some other method, there’s absolutely no guarantee that any of those approved wouldn’t have gone rogue besides the threat of heavy security. This threat of‬ heavy security should be enough to believe in cooperation from the general Duke community; thus, the‬ trouble of “invites” could have been spared. There are real-world public trust and accountability issues‬ here, and they are a fitting framework for our university event.‬The great tragedy is that Walz missed out on potential new voters among our student body and faculty. In my view, anyone who is a part of the Duke Democrats or has been invited, assuming exclusivity, is almost certainly already voting for Harris-Walz. Walz probably did not gain significant new voters from this event‬ besides those possibly garnered from the resulting press and media. A buzzy room plus a firsthand account of Walz’s promises of a better America could have persuaded some to vote blue. The rally was‬ doubly a missed opportunity — it could have been strategically beneficial for Walz and personally‬ transformative for non-affiliated students and undecided voters.‬‭I chatted with a faculty member about this matter. She hypothesized that if the event organizers didn’t limit‬ the event and instead tried to make it a community-wide experience, public pressure would mount to host‬ speakers from the other side of the aisle (like Walz’s current opposition).‬Although these right-wing speakers don’t align with my politics, I don’t think hosting them is such a bad‬‭ idea. Duke students deserve the totality of facts leading up to this election. A diverse series of speaker events with a clear open attendance policy is the way to do so most fairly, meaningfully and potentially‬‭ transformatively. The issue of limited seat availability should be decided on a strictly first-come, first-served basis, agnostic to the apparent political beliefs of the tentative attendee. Let security maintain‬‭ candidate and student safety. Let these events accommodate a melting pot of classmates‬ U.S. with different beliefs. Let the candidates enjoy, at worst, a few hecklers and, at best, a crowd of‬‭ persuaded young voters and potential party members down the line.‬The Duke rally did not decide a Harris-Walz victory or loss. It also likely didn’t cost them any voters, but it didn’t earn them any new ones, either.‬Cara Eaton is a Trinity sophomore."
What students can do to lower their risk for burnout,"Bridgette Hard, Natalie Lewis",2024-11-06T13:00:00Z,Nov,6,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110624-lewis-students-can-lower-burnout-20241106.html,"At this point in the semester, you may be starting to feel your assignments and responsibilities piling up. As a recent Duke graduate of the Class of 2024, I remember constantly juggling weekly assignments alongside papers and exams, friends and extracurriculars. With so many responsibilities, it was challenging to find time to also do laundry, get enough sleep and reassure my family that I was surviving college. Sometimes, the never-ending to-do list became so overwhelming and exhausting that I struggled to get anything done. I wanted to make the most of my time at Duke, but my motivation hit an all-time low.While studying mental health in my psychology and neuroscience classes, I discovered a name for what I was experiencing: burnout. Burnout is a mental health challenge that can result from prolonged exposure to stress and involves feelings of exhaustion and detachment from work.I decided I wanted to understand the experience of college burnout and what, if anything, might prevent it. As part of my senior thesis that I completed under the guidance of Dr. Bridgette Hard in the psychology and neuroscience department, I surveyed students about their experiences with burnout, as well as ways that they nourished their physical and mental well-being through “self care.” Our participants were 370 introductory psychology students; 36 Duke students recruited through word of mouth, social media and fliers; and 299 college students recruited from an online research website. Here is what we found.1. Many students report feeling burnout. Most undergraduate students in our study experienced at least some symptoms of burnout. Burnout can present in students as feelings of inadequacy, wondering whether schoolwork has meaning, sleeping poorly and ruminating over matters relating to school. If these symptoms sound familiar to you, our data suggests that you are not alone!2. Engaging in more self-care predicted less burnout. In our study, students reported using many different self-care strategies to restore their physical and mental health during times of stress. In general, students who prioritized self-care activities more frequently experienced less burnout. Our work suggests that if you want to stay motivated and interested in your work and activities, taking time to nurture your well-being is essential. 3. Certain self-care behaviors were particularly protective. Although students use many forms of self-care, here were the forms of self-care that seemed to work best:A. Nurturing relationships. More than half of our participants preferred socializing with friends and family as a way to rest and recharge. Our study revealed that self-care behaviors that strengthen relationships are a strong protector against burnout. So keep planning study groups, get meals with friends and prioritize the people in your life that mean something to you! I would also suggest incorporating social interactions without substances into your routine because students who used drugs and alcohol as self-care actually reported higher levels of burnout. B. Showing self-compassion. We found lower levels of burnout in students who show themselves compassion, which means being kind and accepting of themselves and their emotions. You may feel the need to be hard on yourself when struggling academically, but our study suggests that positive self-talk and self-forgiveness are key to maintaining well-being and motivation. Next time your workload feels overwhelming, treat yourself the same way you would treat your best friend: listen to your body and allow yourself to process your emotions.C. Staying organized. Students who use organization as self care, including tidying their workspace and living environment or planning out their schedule, experience lower burnout. Sometimes, decluttering or using a planner to balance your time can reassure you that you have control over your responsibilities, promoting motivation and reducing disorganization that can otherwise amplify stress. D. Making time for “brain breaks.” Some students recharge by stepping away from work and engaging in a different, enjoyable activity. Taking time to exercise, listen to music, and watch entertaining videos predicts lower burnout. You don’t need me to tell you twice! Go to the gym, listen to that podcast or watch a little television as a relaxing brain break. Investing in self-care can help you stay energized and motivated throughout the semester. Fostering relationships, being kind to yourself, organizing your space, and taking breaks are great ways to prevent burnout. But self-care is personal and you should find what works best for you! As you approach a difficult time of the semester, consider: What helps you feel restored and re-energized when life gets stressful and overwhelming? What are ways that you can be sure to recharge yourself in the weeks to come?Natalie Lewis T’24 was a neuroscience major at Duke.

It’s time for Duke to up its game on climate change,Tom Campbell,2024-11-06T13:00:00Z,Nov,6,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110624-campbell-up-game-on-climate-change-20241106.html,"Duke is to be commended for taking some positive actions toward reducing its greenhouse gas emissions in recent years. The university’s greenhouse gas emissions are now 31% lower than they were in 2007, and when new off-campus solar arrays come on-line in the coming year, they will be almost 50% lower.So far, so good. But it is disappointing to learn that the target date for Duke’s next set of climate goals will be 25 years in the future — 2050. Simply put, when it comes to our climate, 2050 is far too late.2024 is on track to be by far the hottest year on record, surpassing the record just set in 2023. Preliminary findings by an international team of researchers show that carbon absorption by land — soil, plants, forests — essentially collapsed last year. Not surprisingly, scientists tell us that the pace of global warming is accelerating. The latest UN Climate report, published on October 24th, says that “We are in the midst of a climate emergency, and the window to act is closing fast.” In an article published on October 8th in the journal of the American Institute of Biological Sciences, the authors flat out say that “We are on the brink of an irreversible climate disaster.”In a situation like this, the actions we take in the years just ahead are the actions that are going to matter. If we continue to blow through climate thresholds, it may well be impossible to maintain a livable environment on much of our planet.It is worth noting that right here in Durham, our local governments have set climate goals for themselves that are much more ambitious than Duke’s. The City of Durham and Durham County have committed to transitioning their operations to 80% clean, renewable energy by 2030. And even the woefully underfunded Durham Public Schools have committed to going 80% renewable by 2035. And on the academic front, Middlebury College’s core campus — which is admittedly a good bit smaller than Duke — will be fueled 100% by renewable energy by 2028. (Middlebury’s president, Laurie Patton, was Dean of Arts and Sciences at Duke before she became Middlebury’s president in 2015).It’s probably too late for Duke to set the same climate goal as Middlebury. But why can’t Duke up its game and set the same goal for itself as our local governments have? Commit to transitioning its campus operations to 80% renewable energy by 2030.To reach a goal like this, one thing that Duke would have to do is get over the phobia it seems to have about allowing visible solar panels on its campus. Roof tops and parking lots are everywhere, but there’s hardly a solar panel to be seen. One glaring example is the south-facing Southgate dorm on East Campus, which had a new roof installed just last year. Solar panels on that roof would generate quite a bit of electricity and announce to everyone driving by on Durham’s Main Street that Duke was serious about renewable energy.Solar panels and battery storage have been getting cheaper and more efficient year after year. Duke can take advantage of this, and of the promising new field of geothermal energy, and make some significant changes to its energy mix in the next few yearsSo come on Duke, let's get down to it. You're playing in the World Cup, it's getting late in the second half and we need you to score some goals to help us win this game. There's not going to be any overtime. Set a climate goal that matters — 80% renewable by 2030 —and do what you need to do to achieve that goal.Tom Campbell (T‘70, MEM ‘76) was a former editor for The Chronicle and a former member of the Durham City Council.

But answering each of those questions requires a clear understanding of a more basic matter: Why should we expect our politicians and our fellow citizens to endorse outcomes they disagree with? Why shouldn’t we go out of our way to find reasons to reject a result we find objectionable? It isn’t hard to do. No election in a country as large as our own, with as many ways of registering, with as many ways of voting, and as many ways of counting votes, will be without its complications. Why is this a difficult question at all? Imagine that your preferred candidate loses on November 5. Will you change your mind about the candidates? Probably not. No one says: “Yesterday, I thought Candidate A would be a much better President. Now that she has lost by a few thousand votes, I think Candidate B will be the better President.” This is an important fact about election outcomes. They don’t actually change our views about the candidates and about who would be a better president. It is very likely that you favor one candidate over the other. And you likely think that it would be really bad if their opponent wins. He or she will make decisions that are terrible for the country and the world. So why endorse the idea that the imagined winner should take office when you think they are awful and will make our lives a lot worse? Whatever the reasons, they should be very serious, and they should not depend on you changing your view of the candidates. Here's one reason. Political scientists generally agree that democracy cannot persist if we reject election outcomes. And if we no longer rely on elections, changes in political power will generally occur under the shadow of violence. Unnecessary violence is not good (you didn’t need to read this column to know that … I hope). And avoiding needless violence seems like a serious consideration to bear in mind. Here’s another important reason. Democratic elections, even ones with various flaws like our own, force the powerful to pay attention to the needs of citizens more reliably than alternatives. Fear of an election loss generates laws and policies that make more space for average citizens to lead valuable lives. We have good reasons to think this is generally true (even if in certain cases countries without real political oppositions successfully promote individual well-being). These reasons are part of why we should accept election results. But they are not fully satisfying. If you are like me, you have the sense that there is something disrespectful about ignoring an electoral outcome. That disrespect isn’t captured by either of the two reasons mentioned above. You might think that people who participate in politics have consented to the rules of the political system. And when they search for ways to overturn results, they are acting inconsistently. But consenting requires that you have the opportunity to choose. And almost no one is offered the choice about what kind of political system will govern their lives. Alternatively, you might think that this is an issue of fairness. But is our political system actually fair? It gives greater weight to the votes of people in Wyoming than California and allows the wealthy to exercise immense political influence. If our system is not fair, can fairness be a reason to accept an objectionable outcome? Here’s a better reason. Disregarding the outcome of an election requires you to treat your fellow citizens as pawns rather than as political agents, as people whose actions should not count, as people whose actions can be used to advance your ends. I am the parent of two children. I know when I want them to go to bed. Suppose I offer them a choice: my preferred time or another. If they choose my time, I won’t interfere. I will get what I want, and my kids will feel like people whose actions and judgments have shaped an outcome. They will feel like agents. If they choose another time, I will overturn the decision.In a situation like this, I am not treating my children as people whose views should count. That’s clear in the case where I overturn their decision. But I have not treated them as agents even in the case where they chose “correctly” and I sat on my hands. Why not? Because I was only ever going to accept that one outcome. Their actions have not determined when they will be in bed. This is true even if they feel like they have contributed to the decision. I hope you can see the force of this analogy. If we reject an electoral outcome after the election (or threaten to do so, while encouraging people to vote), we are getting our fellow citizens to act as agents, though we have no intention to respect their choices. This is true even if the electoral system is not perfect. When we do that, we are treating our fellow citizens as individuals whose judgments and actions should not determine the course of our country. We are getting them to act as individuals who can rule, even though we will not heed their actions. That might be ok when it comes to getting your children in bed. But it is disrespectful when we are talking about our fellow citizens. My bed-time example is silly. But the real-world provides examples which are not. When the Venezuelan government disregarded the outcome of its recent election, it did not treat its citizens as rulers of their own country. Why accept the outcome of an election? Why not look for excuses to overturn it? We have more than one good reason to do so. And I have not even mentioned them all. But among the most important is the need to treat our fellow citizens as potential authors of political life. When we reject, or threaten to reject, an election’s outcome, we treat each other like pawns. I think my fellow citizens are owed respect. Perhaps you do too. If so, then you know why you should accept electoral outcomes you passionately disagree with. That’s just what it means to live in a democracy.

How economics can guide us: A story of rationality and equilibrium,Ling Lei,2024-11-05T13:00:00Z,Nov,5,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110424-lei-how-economics-can-guide-us-20241105.html,"How many nights have you found yourself lying awake, with worries piling up like papers on a desk, wondering how much more you can handle? I know the feeling all too well. There was a time when I believed I could power through anything, that pushing myself harder, sleeping less, and taking on more would eventually lead me to success. I told myself I was being strong, resilient, even rational. But deep down, I felt like a spring pulled too tight, no longer able to bounce back.It’s strange, the things we ignore when it comes to ourselves. One winter morning, I struggled to get my car started. The engine groaned in protest, and I realized it simply needed a moment to warm up before it could function. I suddenly saw the parallel: I was expecting my body and mind to perform without any break, like a machine forced to run without pause or maintenance. With our cars, we know better; we wouldn’t drive them hard in freezing weather without warming them up first. We wouldn’t expect them to run on empty, without oil changes or without regular care. We do these things to keep them running smoothly, to keep them on the road for years. So why do we so often treat ourselves with less care?Economics, surprisingly, has a lesson for this. There’s a principle of rationality that helps guide choices within boundaries, maximizing what we can achieve without crossing those personal limits. It’s simple, in theory: know your limits and make choices that respect them, allowing you to perform at your best. And yet, this principle is hard to put into practice. Life’s pressures — grades, career ambitions, social expectations — push us to go beyond what we know is healthy. We stay up late, skipping meals, working through exhaustion, telling ourselves, “just a little more.” We create a short-term equilibrium, just barely holding it together, hoping it will be enough.But what about the long term? Imagine yourself as a car you want to keep running smoothly for many years. You wouldn’t wait until it broke down to take it in for service. You’d fill the tank with good fuel, invest in quality repairs, take it easy when needed, and listen for warning signs. You’d want it to last, not just for today but for all the journeys ahead. Life isn’t so different. When we push ourselves too hard for too long, there comes a point where we lose more than we gain; that fragile equilibrium eventually snaps. We risk losing our well-being, our joy, even our sense of purpose.At a place like Duke, where the pace is fast and the bar high, it’s easy to overlook the importance of long-term balance. We’re surrounded by brilliant, driven peers, and the pressure to keep up can feel overwhelming. But if there’s one thing economics has shown me, it’s that we have the power to be rational — to choose balance. The concept of “long-term equilibrium” invites us to think differently about success. We can honor our limits, set boundaries, take time to rest and refuel and build resilience for the years ahead. In doing so, we create not just a sustainable pace but a fulfilling one, where we don’t just survive but actually thrive.To my peers, I offer this thought: consider what balance looks like for you. Try thinking of equilibrium not as a static state, but as a rhythm you tune and adjust over time, a way to keep yourself steady amid life’s demands. In acknowledging our limits, we’re not giving up on ambition; we’re building a foundation strong enough to carry us forward. By practicing rationality and honoring our boundaries, we reach a place where success isn’t just a moment, but a journey we can enjoy for the long haul. That’s the power of long-term equilibrium — the chance to grow, achieve and find peace in a way that lasts.Ling Lei is a current master’s student in the economics and computation program at Duke."
The best place to leave a mark,Anna Garziera,2024-11-05T13:00:00Z,Nov,5,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110524-garziera-best-place-to-leave-mark-20241105.html,"I don’t need to know anything about you to know that at some point in your life, you’ve changed a small detail about a place to leave one message behind: “I was here.”Maybe you’ve left a pinecone at a bus stop or a row of seashells at the beach. Maybe you’ve built a snowman in a corner of your favorite park or placed a pebble on a stranger’s gravestone. Perhaps you’ve even dared to leave a more permanent mark by carving your name on your desk or dragging your finger in wet cement. You might have taken a sharp blade to the bark of a young tree, enclosing your initials and your sweetheart’s in a heart. As the tree grew, your message grew with it. The world is very different now compared to how it used to be 100,000 years ago. But some human trials have stood the test of time: through the years, we’ve struggled with confronting our mortality. One way we try to cope with that is by leaving a piece of ourselves behind. Evidence of the first human handprints dates back to hundreds of thousands of years ago. When the earliest writing systems hadn’t been established yet, humans found another way of leaving a mark distinctly theirs. A handprint is one of the most personal messages. Palm to palm, we shake hands, we pray, we high-five. Our obsession with our hands has never left us.The last two weeks of summer were busy ones for us incoming resident assistants. After five days of intensive training, our last task was to pick a spot on the East campus graffiti wall and paint a picture representing our QuadX connection. To welcome incoming freshmen, Edens quad, my team, painted a tree. Its leaves were our handprints. We all went home with green hands.We weren’t the only ones. Chains of handprints appeared in the murals of most quads and orientation groups that evening.Throughout orientation week, our drawings were painted over by other artists. They were replaced by tags and political messages. But the echo in the tunnel didn’t change. Generations of students spoke the same words from each layer of paint: “Here I am.” “This is my mark.” “Remember me.”“What will be your legacy?”This was the second essay prompt to a project I did in high school. I didn’t know what to write. I hadn’t thought about it yet. And it’s not an easy thing to think about. Reflecting on our legacy means confronting the fact that some day our existence will come to an end.Throughout time and culture, religion has been used as a means of coming to terms with death. But not everyone has felt that burden lifted. In fact, accepting our death is one of the things we as a species have made the least progress on. Some even argue that modern times have made us go backwards.To some extent, our fear of death is innate. As animals, we have a strong instinct for survival. We feel a physiological urge to continue our bloodline. But that’s not our only worry. We want to make our stories indelible. We don’t want to disappear. Having children is one way that we choose to leave a piece of ourselves behind. By passing down our ideas and our belongings, we try to outlast our bodies.Mothers leave their daughters their wedding rings. Fathers leave their eldest sons their collections of baseball cards. Grandmothers leave their granddaughters their favorite sewing kits. Grandfathers leave their grandsons their favorite smoking pipes.Even here at Duke, we are often told that we should want to leave something behind — that we should want to make a difference in the world.Greatness surrounds us. From world leaders to Nobel Prize winners, all sorts of notable people have graduated from Duke. We are offered several pathways to glory. We could build a corporation empire, develop a prototype for a new technology or discover a cure for cancer. No one would forget our names.But maybe what matters day to day is not whether the world knows our names. That’s a futile goal if it’s pursued for its own sake. Fame can make it difficult to form meaningful relationships — and life’s too short to waste time forming hollow ones. What some don’t realize is that we don’t have to do something grand or leave some physical token behind to be remembered.And we shouldn’t only want to be remembered after we pass away. Oftentimes, Life pulls us apart from our loved ones for reasons other than death. By carving ourselves a space in others’ memories, we shall be remembered not only after our lives, but during them. I said goodbye to my first BFF when I was eleven and my family moved to England. I then said goodbye to my two closest friends when I was seventeen and my family moved to the States. Again, I said goodbye to my high school best friend when we went to different colleges. And next year, I’ll have to say goodbye to my rowing team if I choose to go study in Berlin. Sure, goodbye doesn’t have to be forever. But a lot of times it’s for a long time. And a lot of times, “a long time” is long enough to grow apart. What we’re sometimes left wondering is whether “a long time” is long enough for them to forget about us.“Do you remember me?” I ask this often when I’m scrolling through old pictures. Two best friends in a frame: We look inseparable. Now that we’re distant from each other, I wonder if there’s still something holding us together. I wonder if I still have a space in your heart.Just as we’d like to be remembered after death, we’d like to be thought of while we’re still alive. And this doesn’t just apply to the friends we made in school. We’d like our favorite high school teacher to still think about the lessons they taught us. We’d like our fellow camp counselors to still think about the summer we spent together. We’d like our exes to be reminded of us when they’re walking in the rain.How can we pursue this? Increasing the chances that someone remembers us is relatively simple. We just need to make a difference in their lives. We need to matter to them. Lending others grace can look like many things. We might help a freshman carry his grocery bags home from Whole Foods. We might listen to our friend vent about the professor she doesn’t like. We might say “thank you” to our TAs after everyone else has rushed out of office hours after hounding them for answers without saying a word of appreciation. Often, a small favor goes a long way. Accumulated over time, being graceful to those around helps us form the strongest relationships. What lies beyond death is out of our hands, regardless of what marks we try to make — instead, we should focus on making a difference while we’re still here. Similarly, what lies outside our world is out of our control — we should focus on making a difference in our communities.Even after the Blackwell bench was painted over last year, the handprints of past students still pulsed under the new layer of paint — their spirits were conserved beyond their palms. What mattered was how they contributed to making their dorm a home.Sure, you could leave a mark with a sharpie on the door of a bathroom stall. But there’s a better place to leave a mark: Your loved ones’ hearts.Anna Garziera is a Trinity sophomore. Her pieces typically run on alternate Tuesdays."
Understanding the Hispanic vote,Katherine Ramirez,2024-11-04T13:00:00Z,Nov,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110424-ramirez-understanding-hispanic-vote-20241104.html,"As the Hispanic vote becomes less blue each election cycle, news outlets continue to wonder why. In 2016 Democrats won 65% of the Hispanic vote, and in 2020 this percentage lowered to 62%. But a recent poll in the New York Times estimates that only 52% of Hispanic voters will go for Harris while 40% will vote Trump. Some polls look better for Democrats on the Hispanic vote, but the days of over 60% margins towards Democrats are over. This trend has progressed since the Obama administration ended and has only accelerated in recent years. But when analyzing such trends, many have failed to break down the changing Hispanic vote.When understanding the Hispanic vote, it is important to break down the regional prevalence of different Hispanic origins. According to The Washington Post, western states getting attention in the election such as Nevada and Arizona have largely Mexican diasporas. North Carolina also follows with a significant Mexican population despite its location on the East Coast. In the Northeast and Central Florida there are large Puerto Rican populations, while South Florida has large Cuban and Venezuelan populations.These demographics have large differences in their voter profiles. Mexican voters lean heavily Democrat with attacks from Republicans regarding Hispanics by and large targeting them. Many Mexican families in the U.S. have a long history in the country, so memories of their discrimination in the pre-Civil Right era linger. During this era, the Chicano Movement gained power centering Mexican Americans, where many of their demands received support from Democrats and dismissal from Republicans. For those who are more recent immigrants, they often rely on the immigration policies pushed by Democrats, or have family and friends who do. The strict immigration policies and threat of deportation from Republicans is very real for Mexican American immigrants.Cubans and Venezuelans, on the other hand, infamously favor Republicans in large part due to a distrust in socialism, which Republicans have successfully connected to Democrats. This is especially pronounced with Republicans from South Florida, with politicians such as Maria Salazar pushing anti-communist legislation. On top of that, Cuban Americans carry disdain for John F. Kennedy, believing he abandoned them during the Bay of Pigs. This carries over as resentment towards modern Democrats, especially among older Cubans. Cubans also found themselves with an easier time immigrating with policies such as the Cuban Adjustment Act, allowing any Cuban who stayed in the U.S. for a year to be granted permanent residence, meaning they have little connection to the immigrant struggle of Mexicans and Central Americans. The Cuban and Venezuelan diaspora in the US are majority white, so they largely don’t identify with the POC struggle like many other Hispanic groups do.The Puerto Rican vote also leans Democrat, though they don’t face the same immigration barriers as Mexican Americans due to Puerto Rico’s status as a US territory. Attention has come onto them recently since Trump’s rally in Madison Square where comedian Tony Hinchliffe referred to Puerto Rico as “a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean.” It is hard to say what sort of impact this comment will have on the election, but it might dull enthusiasm for voting Republican among undecided Puerto Ricans.Most Hispanics in the US also aren’t immigrants and even fewer are among eligible voters. Two-thirds of Hispanics are U.S.-born, and those numbers are only growing with the younger generation. Republican rhetoric has often focused on targeting immigrants, but when the average Hispanic is not an immigrant, this rhetoric may not be as alarming to the population as Democrats have long assumed. Like most voters, Hispanics have placed the cost of living and other economic issues as their top priorities before immigration. They hold more left-leaning positions on immigration compared to the general American populus, but it likely won’t sway their votes as much as other topics.When it comes to religion, around 43% of Hispanic adults identify as Catholic, since Catholicism is heavily embedded into many Hispanic cultures. While Catholics vote more liberal than their Protestant counterparts in America, the conservative cultural elements of Catholicism can’t be overlooked. U.S. Hispanics are less socially conservative than they once were, especially since identification with religion is down among young people. But the Hispanic population has often held more conservative views on LGBTQ+ rights and abortion than the general population, especially the foreign-born population. The current trends of Hispanics becoming more socially progressive might seem to run against becoming more Republican, but appeals to social conservatism are effective in winning many older, religious Hispanic voters.Discussions of the Hispanic vote have typically focused on Mexican Americans, but the Hispanic vote has become more diverse with time. Between 2010 and 2022, there was a decrease in immigration from Mexico and an increase in immigration from the Caribbean, Central America and South America. With these groups often voting differently than the historically Democrat Mexicans, along with a growth in native born Hispanics and declining religious affiliation, the Hispanic vote is increasingly complicated. It is a mistake for news outlets to group Hispanics as one voting block, which has become clear with the confusion around their rightward shift.Katherine Ramirez is a Trinity first-year."
A poetic prayer to elect our common humanity,Luke A.

Also a theologian and mediator, Ó Tuama will lead a poetry workshop for students at Duke and also join me for a public conversation on “Poetry, Prayer, and Public Healing” on November 19. Ó Tuama’s writing, workshops, and popular podcast “Poetry Unbound” weave together poetry, prayer, etymology and personal testimony to point to truths about ourselves, our relationships and the mystery of God. One example is an Irish proverb he cites in his memoir: “It is in the shelter of each other that the people live.” With Ó Tuama’s example in mind, this column is my own prayerful poem — or maybe poetic prayer — for embracing a civic vision of sheltering one another.

"Duke-inspired romcom, “Midnight in K-Ville,” greenlit at Netflix",Monday Monday,2024-11-04T13:00:00Z,Nov,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110424-monday-monday-midnight-in-k-ville-20241104.html,"Editor's note: The article below is satire.Deadline just broke the news that Durham will host a new romantic comedy following a messy love triangle of three Duke students. What they failed to mention was that the cast will not only include a star basketball player because, duh, but I will also be making my Hollywood debut as the center of the triangle. “Midnight in K-Ville” will begin production at Duke this spring. Some anticipated shooting locations include a Bassett dorm room with a too-small twin mattress and that one unused classroom in the Social Sciences building. Action scenes are expected to include a steamy car encounter in Blue Zone and a trained squirrel attack outside the coffee shop, Bella Union. Over the winter, the other two leads and I will shoot scenes in places like Krzyzewskiville tents and locations that fulfill Duke’s Unofficial Graduation Requirements. Few plot details have been shared, but Netflix revealed that the romance begins with an O-week hookup between an orientation leader and my character, a freshman. The situationship grows messier when they turn out to be both the freshman’s TA and RA — a triple threat to the leader’s employment if discovered with a student.When the orientation leader could only bump the freshman’s Chem 101 grade from 40% to 55%, they split, vowing to never make eye contact during the lab discussion or room checks for the rest of the semester. The love triangle develops after a basketball player starts to like the freshman, making the orientation leader jealous and gain interest again. So toxic, I know. However, Netflix is just trying to capture the authentic social culture of Duke, so I welcomed the realism and even suggested adding a scene where a student seduces their econ professor to get a better grade. The orientation leader invited the freshman to spend the night in his K-Ville tent the week after he gained interest again. However, their best friend confronted the freshman about the noise the following day since, like most, the freshman forgot how thin the tent’s material was. Now, they must decide between dating the orientation leader or switching to the basketball star. The University’s president released a statement on the film, “As part of our commitment to show genuine community authenticity at Duke, Netflix has promised to cast their supporting roles to legacy students. They are particularly excited to work with the famed Cameron Crazies but have reservations about including the student Line Monitors in the film after they heard us refer to them as ‘being like theater kids but without the talent.’”Netflix rejected the Line Monitors’ demands for producer credits, laughing that ""they can’t even control the student section’s cheers!"" Instead, Netflix will cast the Line Monitor roles through an open casting, with preference given to students described by peers as ""universally disliked.""Netflix is also holding an open casting call for extras in “Midnight in K-Ville,” but it comes with a catch: Duke plans to charge the extras who aren’t already involved in theater a participation fee, as being credited in the film could boost their resume by “diversifying their interests.” If successful, Netflix plans to expand the DCU, Duke Cinematic Universe, to incorporate realistic movies about the struggles of students switching from pre-med to English, as well as dabble in fantasy where the buses magically come on time. There is even talk about a new show, “Keeping up with the K’s,” depending on how much traction “Midnight in K-Ville” gains.Following the “Midnight in K-Ville” announcement, UNC has reportedly been in contact with Starz to create their own romantic comedy, “Franklin Street: Freaks in the Sheets.” The creators also clarified that “Midnight in K-Ville” was meant to be released in 2026, but filming for the Duke Chapel scene was delayed due to the year-long wedding waitlist."
Democracy is on the ballot,David E. Price,2024-11-01T12:00:00Z,Nov,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/103124-price-democracy-is-on-ballot-20241101.html,"For weeks, Duke faculty have been writing about the ""virtues of democracy"" and how American democracy, imperfect as it is, is imperiled in modern times. As a faculty member emeritus and a recently-retired, 34-year veteran of the U.S. House of Representatives, I have some urgent thoughts on these matters, based on front-row observation and coming into sharp focus as a landmark election looms ahead.The 2024 election poses the starkest of choices, with the values we profess as Americans — justice for all, the expansion of opportunity, environmental stewardship, world leadership, the freedoms we hold dear — on the line. Also at stake, to a degree that has rarely been true of American elections, are the bedrock principles and norms of constitutional democracy, the foundation upon which all else is built. Most of us never expected to face an election of this character — but neither did we anticipate the rise and seductive appeal of a demagogue like Donald Trump, nor the embrace of authoritarian means and ends by one of our major political parties. It is important to understand these historic developments and the obligations they place on us as we contemplate the future of our country this fall. It was evident in the 2016 campaign, and certainly as early as the publication by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt of ""How Democracies Die,"" that Donald Trump tested positive on all four components of the litmus test for autocrats: Weak commitment to the democratic rules of the game. Recall the frequent, false claims of voter fraud and the contempt for constitutional and legal constraints. Denial of the legitimacy of opponents. Trump perpetuated ""birther"" claims about Barack Obama for years, and repeatedly called Hillary Clinton a criminal, encouraging followers to chant ""lock her up.""Toleration or encouragement of violence. Trump encouraged assaults on protestors at his rallies and frequently hinted that followers should act on their Second Amendment rights. Readiness to curtail the civil liberties of opponents, including the media. Trump constantly threatened his media opponents with retaliation and demanded that the Justice Department do his bidding and protect his interests. By 2020, when I produced the fourth edition of ""The Congressional Experience,"" the indictment had lengthened: delegitimizing and downgrading judicial, investigative and security agencies; blocking legitimate investigations of his own conduct; abusing his power to declare emergencies, seeking to rule by fiat; diverting funds appropriated by law to pet projects such as a border wall; and claiming absolute power under the Constitution. ""I have an Article II,"" Trump famously declared. ""I have the right to do whatever I want as president.""And then it got worse, worse than anyone had imagined. As it became evident that Trump had lost both the popular and electoral vote in 2020, the point of all his years of falsely claiming voter fraud and rigged elections became clear: He asserted that the election had been stolen and set out to subvert it and block the peaceful transfer of power — anti-democratic actions unprecedented in American history. Trump and his collaborators pressured state officials to undo or tamper with the election results, engineered the formation of alternative sets of fake electors in contested states, and pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count the legitimate electoral votes from those states. Trump urged his supporters to make their way to Washington, to march on the Capitol, and do whatever it took to stop the certification of the electoral college vote. A violent insurrection ensued, taking the lives of five Capitol police officers; Trump delighted in the scene for hours, despite the pleas of family and staff to call off the rioters. ""Remember this day forever,"" Trump told his followers as the Capitol was finally being secured. The sad spectacle of the party of Lincoln abandoning democratic norms and practices antedated Trump. Particularly significant was the ""Tea Party"" election of 2010, after which Republicans in multiple states, including North Carolina, set out to reverse the country’s progress toward an inclusive, multiracial, pluralist democracy. Indeed, our state was Exhibit A for these efforts, which featured restrictive voter ID laws, onerous registration requirements, curtailed early voting, extreme racial and partisan gerrymandering and the wholesale abandonment of the formerly bipartisan Voting Rights Act. Trump’s presidency did not create the Republican party’s turn to white Christian identity politics, but it greatly accelerated it – a movement anti-majoritarian by definition and increasingly anti-democratic in the means it required. By 2020, Levitsky and Ziblatt note in their new book, ""The Tyranny of the Minority,"" ""voices of conservative opposition to Trump’s extremism"" had been virtually extinguished within the Republican party. These are the forces we are contending with in 2024. And as grave as the implications are for our own democracy, they do not stop there. As former chair of the House Democracy Partnership (HDP), the bipartisan commission dedicated to building effective representative institutions in developing democracies, I am particularly sensitive to the implications of a second Trump presidency for democracy worldwide and for America as its champion. Trump has displayed only disdain for such diplomatic efforts, preferring an ""America first"" approach to foreign relations, rooted mainly in military power. His budgets radically slashed funding for democracy promotion, cuts which Congress only partially restored. Earlier this year, I visited Guatemala with an HDP delegation, offering support to their Congress at a critical time for their democracy. President Biden is widely credited for the skillful diplomacy that resulted in the seating of a newly elected reformer, Bernardo Arevalo, as president, despite powerful forces seeking to subvert the election result. We quickly learned that these same autocratic forces are eagerly awaiting a second Trump term, confident that it will spell the end of international pressures to abide by democratic norms. Democracy, indeed, is on the line. ""Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails,"" Kamala Harris warned in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. As is readily evident from the Trump team’s Project 2025 and their candidate’s own words, Trump plans to implement the ""unitary executive theory"" that would give him unchecked power, removing the guardrails represented by the independent status of the Justice Department and other agencies, civil service rules and the constitutional prerogatives of other branches of government. Project 2025 explicitly calls for the removal of civil service protections for thousands of federal employees and their replacement by political appointees. Even the military would be subject to political purification.Given the chance by a reporter to disavow concerns that he would seek retribution and abuse power, Trump responded that he planned to be a dictator only on ""day one."" We should take him at his word, and be assured that the assault on democracy and the rule of law would not stop on day one. The only way to stop it is to never let Donald Trump near the presidency again.David E.

Nothing is that deep! Or is it?,Angarag Gantogoo,2024-11-01T12:00:00Z,Nov,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110124-gantogoo-nothing-is-that-deep-20241101.html,"There’s nothing quite like the buzz of competition among students. Whether it's vying for top grades, landing a coveted internship, or just showcasing who has the better campus spirit, the need to one-up each other is practically baked into academic culture. But is it really that serious? Or are we just overthinking it? I remember this one time my friend accidentally wore a Duke shirt to UNC. What happened next wasn’t surprising. People were rude. Some gave her cold stares, others made snarky comments, and a few even screamed ‘You don’t belong here!’. It was like she’d committed an unforgivable crime. Sure, the rivalry between the two schools is legendary, but was it really that deep? Apparently, it was.This led to the question: Why do we care so much? Why does wearing the “wrong” shirt spark such intense reactions? Why do we feel a twinge of satisfaction when we ace a test that others found challenging, or when we snag an opportunity that our peers didn’t? It’s all about competition, and in some ways, maybe it’s just part of human nature.For students, competition is often tied to identity and self-worth. It’s not just about getting an “A” or making it to the Dean’s List; it’s about proving something — to our parents, our professors and, most importantly, ourselves. In a world where academic achievements are quantified and ranked, it’s easy to equate our accomplishments with our value. A rivalry between two schools, like UNC and Duke, may be playful on the surface, but it goes deeper. It’s a way to feel part of something bigger than ourselves, to bask in the glow of a shared victory, and to show the world (or at least the student section) that we’re on the “winning” team.In some ways, competitive behaviour can redeem our ego. It can be validating to win or to prove that we belong among the best. The thrill of competition isn’t just about beating others; it's also about feeling seen, heard and validated. In an academic setting, the stakes feel high because they are — grades, future opportunities and social recognition are all on the line. When we succeed, it’s as if the universe has given us a stamp of approval. We belong. We’re good enough. And we get to walk around campus wearing our metaphorical “winning team” jersey.But here’s the kicker — what happens when we lose? When my friend was ridiculed for her Duke shirt, she laughed it off. But not everyone can brush off the sting of not measuring up. Losing — whether it's on a test, in a game, or just feeling left out of a prestigious group — can feel like a blow to the ego. The same competitive drive that lifts us up can also drag us down, making us feel smaller or less capable. It’s a double-edged sword, and maybe that’s why we get so worked up about seemingly trivial things, like which school has the better team or who got the highest score in class. So competitive behaviour among students may not be just about grades or games. It may be about identity, belonging, and ego. Maybe nothing is that deep... or maybe, when it comes to competition, it’s all a lot deeper than we’re willing to admit.Angarag Gantogoo is a Trinity junior.

Finding the right answer was never the point,Islam Tayeb,2024-11-01T12:00:00Z,Nov,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110124-tayeb-right-answer-never-the-point-20241101.html,"Throughout my time at Duke, there have been a few conversations that I found myself repeatedly having with my peers that go along the lines of “nature vs. nurture”, “is your phone an intrinsic part of your mind” and other pretentious conversations that are like puzzles and toys to play with in a conversation. I noticed that there are two types of approaches people take towards these conversations: one, attempt to create a sound argument to answer the literal question, or two, blurt out their gut answer and explore what made them think that way, attempting to formulate an argument as they go. The first approach often involves discussions about semantics of words in the question and a lot of theoreticals — definitely intellectually stimulating. The second approach often comes with multiple tangents that uncover my peers' lores that support their gut feeling — it feels much more lax and exploratory.Sure, I might be wrong in which I prefer, but that wasn’t the point of the discussion to begin with.Both approaches are perfectly valid, but I always find myself resonating and trying to invite people to engage in the second approach. I believe that one’s truest self is reflected by their habits and intrinsic beliefs, and it’s a lot more interesting to understand the backstories which make people intrinsically respond a certain way towards these arguments than try to actually formulate a proper argument — starting with the answer then with reasoning has always been more fun to me.For example, for the “nature vs. nurture” conversations, a peer told me about how his gut seems to only believe in the argument for nature as a “formality,” but has a hard time internalizing that some people could be born in a way that makes them different. Eventually, he uncovered that if he accepts “nature” as a predominant player in the development of one’s self, then it’d imply that his pathway in life is already built with certain careers and activities that would be optimal for his natural build. In a way, he ignores “nature” so he doesn’t have to think about whether he’s built for entrepreneurship, dance, or playing the clarinet; after all, ignorance is bliss.I’ve also had a peer mention that they think people underestimate “nature” a lot. He started with an argument about one’s career and hobbies being largely influenced by their “nature,” as improving quicker than most in activities as a child due to intrinsic traits would naturally keep you in the game for a longer time to get good. For example, small variations in your size in kindergarten could make you sweep the competition when playing sports and keep you in the game for longer. However, he eventually shared how his family kept pushing him toward “proper” engineering, but he just couldn’t make himself care about it the way he did about game design. For him, believing in “nature” allows him to cope with his rebellion against his parents; it’s a lot easier to pursue something that you’re convinced you were born for. Whether the “nature” part is a knack for creative pursuits or mere rebellion, he believes that this line of reasoning allows him to feel better about himself for pursuing such a career. It’s not about whether he’s right about nature predominating or not — it’s a venue for him to share a deeply defining story.We have an innate love for making connections and seeking the “truth,” which oftentimes doesn’t let us discuss these questions of “nature vs. nurture” to their fullest extent in an average conversation. Though similar personal stories could’ve been expressed with the first approach as two people approach the question literally (similar to a brain teaser), the second approach provides a rich environment for humanity and connection to be emphasized. It allows one to think with the other person about why they think the way they do. Sure, science and logic might state that nature and nurture work together, but I think there’s ripe conversation to be had about our subjective views that are informed by our life experience rather than a logical line of reasoning. Ironically, approaching more conversations with lax unseriousness could lead to more deeply serious discussion.These silly little conversations and topics can be discussed without a pretentious philosophical discussion — the “nature v. nurture” conversation isn’t the most natural discussion to have — but if the door opens itself to such discussions, I enjoy my time with people who take it as an exploration instead of a search for the right answer. There’s a certain freedom in not having to reach a conclusion. Letting a conversation wander without a set goal leads to more interesting insights. It’s not always about the topic and answers themselves but about understanding where people are coming from and what shapes their thinking.It’s fun to take it easy in a conversation and simply toy holistically with ideas instead of analyzing them. It brings out more humanity than most investigative discussions. These small conversations let us engage without the pressure of certainty, making room for genuine understanding. It’s not about proving a point but about grasping how someone else views the world. The value of conversation isn’t in finding the right answer — it’s in the exploration of thoughts and beliefs that reveal who we are and how we think.Islam Tayeb is a Trinity sophomore."
The art of going solo: Fall break adventures in DC,Valentina Garbelotto,2024-10-31T12:00:00Z,Oct,31,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/103124-garbelotto-art-going-solo-20241031.html,"I’ve been called codependent more times than I care to admit. I’m not one to walk to class, go to the library, or grab dinner by myself. If I can have a friend with me, why wouldn’t I? When I’m with someone, they occupy my mind and time. I forget everything swirling in my head — the doubts, worries, self-consciousness. When I’m alone, I’m forced to sit with my anxious mind, and that’s not always the most comfortable place to be.Yet, I’ve come to realize that breaking out of my comfort zone and doing things alone isn’t just a nice skill to have — it’s necessary. And that independence is something I’ve been slowly learning to embrace.Sometimes, all it takes is spending a quiet afternoon by yourself to experience how beautiful solitude can be, especially when you’re open to it. I discovered this during fall break, when I found myself alone in Washington, D.C., thanks to a visa appointment for my upcoming study abroad in Spain. Stranded — no friends to walk with, talk with, eat with — I was forced to face the city alone.Now, let me be real with you — I didn’t see this as an exciting opportunity for solo exploration. I saw it as a chance to get kidnapped, robbed, or worse. After growing up in Buenos Aires, I was well versed in the essentials: Don’t have your phone out or wear headphones while on the street, and always keep your eyes peeled. Although, the first proved impossible when I needed Google Maps to reach my destination.I was on high alert, more focused on surviving the day than on soaking in the beauty of D.C. But despite my initial anxiety, that day forced me to rely on myself in ways I hadn’t before. I visited the Holocaust Museum and the International Spy Museum, navigating the city and making decisions without anyone to guide me. I had to adapt during my appointment the next morning when the Spanish university put the wrong date on my acceptance letter. Through tears, I managed to call Duke and correct the issue.It wasn’t the adventure I’d imagined, but it was real-world problem-solving. Whether finding my way around or handling an unexpected obstacle, I did it all without my family or friends there to guide me. Here’s the thing about independence: It’s not an inherent trait. You don’t wake up one day magically confident and self-sufficient. It’s something you build, little by little, by intentionally putting yourself in situations where you have no choice but to rely on yourself.Society loves to tell us, especially women, that we should be afraid of doing things alone. We’re taught that the world is dangerous and that wandering alone invites trouble. And yes, there are precautions we should take — trusting your gut (sometimes walking just doesn’t feel right) and hiding your phone. But solitude doesn’t have to be synonymous with fear.The beauty of venturing solo is that it forces you to confront uncertainty head-on and trust your instincts. You learn to make decisions without a safety net. I felt safer Ubering around the city and ordering takeout to my Airbnb. But there’s no shame in that — baby steps matter. Acknowledge the little milestones, because without them we’d get nowhere. And who knows, maybe next time I’ll feel brave enough to walk around and eat out. Embracing solo adventures has helped me rewrite that narrative of fear. It’s given me a sense of autonomy and power that’s hard to describe until you’ve experienced it. I’ve realized that independence isn’t just about surviving. It’s about thriving in situations where you once felt small, incapable of overcoming the obstacles that inevitably come with them. It’s about proving to yourself that you can make decisions, solve problems, and enjoy life on your own (non-anxious) terms.Not everyone wants to do things alone, though. Some people thrive in groups, and there’s nothing wrong with that. However, I think we’ve internalized this expectation that everything — whether it’s a fun outing or a big life event — should be experienced with others. The fear of being alone in public, of doing things without a friend, can be petrifying. But there’s a difference between being alone and feeling lonely, and it's the fear of the second that limits us.It’s easy to think that dining alone or visiting a museum solo invites judgment, but the truth is, that most people are too wrapped up in their own lives to notice. The world is full of people doing things on their own, and there's strength in showing up for yourself — no audience required.We often think that company is what makes an experience worthwhile, but what if the real value comes from doing things because we enjoy them, rather than the people we share them with? We should choose company because we want it, not because we need it to legitimize our adventures. Human connection is important, but even more so is your connection with yourself.When you do things by yourself — even if it’s as simple as taking a train ride alone (shoutout to Amtrak) — you learn how to face the world with confidence. You gain a deeper sense of self-reliance and learn to trust yourself. The more you push yourself to get out there the more you’ll enjoy alone time. After all, we should be looking forward to life after college, not dreading it.Push against the internalized belief that everything has to be a group activity by doing something for yourself, by yourself. It may be hard to do and uncomfortable as hell. But it’s worth it. Not because it’ll “change your life,” but because it’ll change the way you see yourself and those around you. You don’t even have to go far: Exploring Downtown Durham or sitting in a coffee shop can be just as meaningful as taking the train to NYC or flying to Europe. Even sitting on the quad, soaking in the sun and doing your own thing counts. It’s through these small steps that you’ll realize just how much life there is to explore — solo.Valentina Garbelotto is a Trinity junior. Her column, “Dear comfort zone: It’s not me, it’s you.

Duke students don’t care about art,Shambhavi Sinha,2024-10-30T12:00:00Z,Oct,30,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/103024-sinha-duke-students-dont-care-art-20241030.html,"There is immensely meaningful and empowering work being done in the art spheres at Duke: from the many shows celebrating the rich culture here to the impactful exhibits in the Rubenstein Library and the Goodson Chapel. Many works are being shown on campus, and many more are being created. But how much of this exploration and engagement extends beyond that immediate circle? On a daily basis, we consume infinitely more art than we can even imagine producing in a lifetime. But how intensively do we engage with this art? How much does the average Duke student care about art? For one, the student view of the Nasher leaves much to be desired. In my many visits, it is not rare to see the many students pose at the Nasher Cafe. The museum serves a far greater purpose than aesthetic Instagram feeds. Yet it is rare to see someone pause and take in the artwork, much less discuss it with anyone around. There seems to be an air of indifference toward the many exhibits that come and go. The Nasher is a living museum that allows us to view the larger scope of human existence. It is a chance to escape “the Duke Bubble” that so many try to find. It is distinct, with a focus that emphasizes the lives and collective struggles of the identities and ideas of being human. It allows us to foster community, especially when it empowers the artists and perspectives of today, and what is important in our shared collective mind. From exhibits exploring the nature of identity when it is denied to us (“Numbers” by Sherrill Roland explores the dehumanization of inmates during incarceration) to studying the way we’re redefining what nature is, in a world that is rapidly losing it (“Second Nature” explores photography in the Age of the Anthropocene and the impact of humans on the world). These pieces, and the discussion they bring, influence and impact not only the present but the future we have and prioritise. And, it does matter what we as students prioritise and how we value what we have. Beyond the consumption of the “artistic canon” in museums, it is important to contemplate our artistic production. The Duke student body suffers deeply from Canva syndrome: Marketing design has now become a never-ending gallery of insufferably generic Canva designs. In an era of generative AI, it seems like no one really needs to know how to do anything. There’s always a service for it. Do I expect the most groundbreaking, abstract-surrealist-kafka-esque-anti-design poster for another consulting info session? Not really. But trust me, we could gain so much by allowing just a bit of self-expression and diversity, by breaking the boundaries a little. This is meaningful, because graphic design has always been viewed as a sort of “utilitarian” counterpart to art: with a strict sense of principles that come along with it. But students have always redefined what it means to design: Graphic design has been one of the many ways students at college campuses express themselves. They create posters for the things they are passionate about and design for social meaning and personal connection. The aim is not solely to convey or persuade, but also to express oneself. In this way, students and their culture and notions towards design form the cornerstone of self-expression and engagement with the arts. So when we all use the same Canva templates and use DALL-E (or Stable Diffusion, if you’re fancy like that) to generate the same pastel gradient posters for our clubs, we lose out on the human touch of art. I’d be happy to return to MS Word Art and ‘90s web design if it meant I would never see these generic “anti-design” designs ever again. Our biggest loss is the death of individuality in design — and, in a larger sense, the essence of art itself, which is ironic given we live in an era where everything is algorithmically individualized for our tastes. And it shows, in the design elements that blend into each other, in the History Union posters that are indistinguishable from the AKPsi posters. Because at the core, these algorithms all want us to be the same: mindless consumers. They succeed if we stop engaging, if we see art not as a means of connection, but as a means of corporate communication. And we are: We consume it as if it’s fast food, constantly stimulating all of our senses, overwhelming them, just to prevent the minute possibility of a single thought occurring. We consume art, but we don’t engage in it. Because if thoughts occur, we have to act on them. We have to contemplate the state of the world, and the state of our existence in it. And we (and our capitalist overlords) would be much happier if we didn’t. So what? Isn’t it the same everywhere? The consumption of art in such fashion, the reduction of its inherent cultural value as you spend an equivalent amount of time viewing (and double-tapping) a work of art — one that an artist poured hours of their heart and soul into, mind you — and yet another disappointed-cat meme. Everyone lives like this. This is the new reality.Or so some would argue. But on campuses elsewhere, communities are being fostered around art, around the ingenuity of human creation. While we tent for days in the freezing cold for basketball games, undergraduates at the University of Chicago line up for Picasso paintings to keep in their dorms for a year. Art to Live With, a premiere art loan program at the University of Chicago, provides students with artworks from their collection to display in their dorms for an entire academic year. The whole program operates on a first-come-first-serve basis, and so it becomes a huge celebration week of the arts during the fall semester, where students (especially first years) bond and forge connections over a shared love for art, created by artists around the world — from Francisco Goya to Takashi Murakami — and loved by students around the world. Other campuses share a similar intellectual vein and love for developing a community around art and art makers. Princeton opens its historic art museums for an annual night crawl — imagine you’re Ben Stiller in “Night At The Museum” — and Harvard has its annual Arts First festival, a celebration of creation through exhibits and performances produced by students. MIT goes hard (if you ask me): Each year, graduating students design their own class ring (the “Brass Rat”).In ways like these, other institutions keep alive a culture of engagement and reflection of togetherness through art. They contemplate the creation of the past, of the present, of the future. I firmly believe art (and its interpretation) to be one of the major cornerstones of a liberal arts education, and while Duke enforces it through an arts requirement (with dubious success), this enforcement hardly sustains the intellectual culture we should be aiming for, in a world that pushes you to consume more and think less. After all, if we cease thinking, or motivate a superficial sort of it, we won’t reflect. We won’t understand our place in the world — much less want to change it — for we would exist in a state of blissful ignorance and indifference, where we think what we’re supposed to, or even better, not at all. We do what we are assigned to do: nothing more, nothing less. But beyond this enforcement, it seems that Duke lacks this push for getting its students engaged in the arts. Arts week comes around for every freshman, but what after? Engagement with the arts eventually becomes a niche: “Leave it to the artsy humanities majors, while we study something ‘real,’” some might say. We do not reflect on art, much less create it. Art drives self-meditation, pushes us to reflect on what has been our story, our purpose, our meaning. It is a process of patience and introspection, and its outcome is creation. By creating, we become involved in the universe’s process of creation and destruction, rather than being passive watchers with minds of high entropy: chaotic, lacking meaning or motivation. What the universe does in creating grand galaxies, or destroying bright stars, we reflect (at a much smaller scale) by creating meaning in society, and destroying injustices. It is what makes art the cornerstone of the liberal arts, for this patience, introspection and self-actualization are the catalysts for a human being that lives, rather than survives. When we refuse art, we cease reflection, we cease growth. We cease the growth of the social mind, of the scientific mind. The collective engagement with the arts is the first step to creating reflective and introspective students who can think for themselves, and in the future, act for a better world. There is a difference between a student body that tents for 90-minute basketball games, and one that tents for Picasso’s “The Dream and Lie of Franco.” And while one isn’t necessarily better than the other, it would do us some good to instill in the student body a long and sustainable love for the arts. It is through art that we find meaning. In ourselves, in our time here, and beyond. Shambhavi Sinha is a Trinity sophomore. Her pieces typically run on alternate Mondays."
Raining gumdrops and bombs,Emily Esmaili,2024-10-30T12:00:00Z,Oct,30,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/103024-esmaili-raining-gumdrops-and-bombs-20241030.html,"“If all the raindrops were lemon drops, and… bomb drops?” My 6-year-old couldn’t quite remember all of the song she had learned in school, but this didn’t sound quite right to her. Nor did it sound right to me — this morbid version of “lemon drops and gumdrops” made me freeze in place. I suppose I cannot completely shield my children from the world’s news.I try my best to keep our dinnertime discussions away from my opinions on conflict in the Middle East and immigration policy. But as an Iranian-American pediatrician working in a clinic that serves immigrant and refugee children, I suppose things slip once in a while. News of the horrific showering of bombs in the Middle East is hard to filter. Meanwhile, another disaster hit closer to home — the tropical storm that has washed away so much of western North Carolina, one of our family’s favorite mountain biking destinations.You don’t have to be a pediatrician to know that it’s the children both in western North Carolina and in the Middle East that are more vulnerable and more deeply affected by disasters. Both groups of youngsters need our immediate help.Thankfully, aid has been rushing into western North Carolina — within days, helicopters were dropping food, water and diapers. But in the Middle East, close to where my other family lives, what mostly drops from the sky are explosives. In Gaza, hundreds of thousands of families are cut off from all aid, and the region has been without adequate food and water for months. More children have died from conflict there in four months than have died globally in the last four years. And society and politicians alike have chosen to look the other way, silent.I’ve worked with children in refugee camps in different parts of the world — Greece, Thailand, India, Rwanda — and with refugee and immigrant children resettled here in Durham. And as many humanitarian workers will say, certain things you just cannot unsee. I cannot unsee the shrapnel in eardrums, disfiguring burns and severe anxiety. Many children under my care have seen bombs fall like raindrops from the sky. Their homes were flooded, burned or forcibly taken from their families. They still cry when a plane flies overhead, or when fireworks go off at the ballpark.No child should have to fear bombs falling from the sky, real or imagined. No child needing aid should be barred from receiving it. Imagine our devastated western North Carolinians, if emergency relief was not allowed in. And if we felt it best to hold a position of neutrality, and just not act or speak out for their suffering. Imagine how our children might feel, if we simply looked the other way when friends and families’ homes and lives had been ruined.Conflict and natural disasters are human realities, but there are certain rules of fair play that must be upheld. These rules of humanitarian law are not being upheld in the Middle East and many other war-torn parts of the world. Children caught in these disasters are most heavily impacted, and yet global communities are choosing to remain silent.As a pediatrician but mostly as a mother, I ask you to speak up. Speak to your government representatives. Vote. Speak to your children in an open and honest way about what they see on the news. Teach them fairness, and the possibility of peace. Teach them to sing, with the right lyrics: “If all the raindrops were lemon drops and gumdrops, oh what a rain that would be …”Emily Esmaili is a pediatrician at Lincoln Community Health Center in Durham and an adjunct assistant professor at the Duke Global Health Institute."
A mistaken view of liberal learning,Marc Wang,2024-10-29T12:00:00Z,Oct,29,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102924-wang-mistaken-view-of-liberal-learning-20241029.html,"Answering the perennial question of what university education should be requires a return to first principles. Speak to many Duke students and you get the idea that the university is failing to shore up the idea of liberal education which we have come to expect from, and in many ways associate with, university life. We should first consider what that idea is.One need not cast about too much for signs of dissatisfaction with the current state of things to be seen. Venture around campus and one might encounter students bemoaning the drudgery of calculus and linear algebra, required courses for most; we hear from friends that there are other classes they wish to be taking instead of major requirements; and too often, we ourselves feel confined by a lack of options for intellectual exploration, despite the ostensible freedom to choose and the variety of classes available. The solution, we tend to think, is greater effort on the part of the university to create a more comprehensive education by introducing new classes or promoting wide-ranging academic exploration.It is perhaps a testament to the sterile careerist pragmatism of modern higher education that many of us see broadening the curriculum as a cure. We imagine ourselves thinkers and entrepreneurs and poets, ranging with equal ease over the serried plains of disparate disciplines, and see in the curriculum an implicit encouragement for specialization when it is our multifarious interests that we want to explore. But to oppose the status quo by calling for breadth over depth is to take a mistaken view of liberal learning, and this amounts to an abnegation of the same kind.Popular demand for classes that broaden students’ knowledge has led to the creation of classes specifically designed to be interesting, often with descriptions featuring words like “life” and “human” and as parts of an increasingly bewildering array of subject categories that surpass even the dizzying nomenclature of algebraic structures. Students who take them typically engage with the material for a few lectures before lapsing back into apathy and wondering why the course’s content lives up to none of its claims of force. In the end, consoling themselves that the class is anyhow unrelated to their intended professions, they turn to large language models and other AI-based tools to compose their assignments, an act that is the very repudiation of the motivation with which they were supposed to have begun. Such cases are, unfortunately, all too typical.The trouble is that an education concerned foremost with breadth of study is unable to capture what makes each subject profound and absorbing. What we really want is penetration into an idea, an understanding and attunement to all its facets and connections; as such, it is no wonder that whistle-stop readings, explanations and critiques as typically found in introductory and interdisciplinary classes leave us dissatisfied. We end up wondering why such figures as Homer and Aristotle and Machiavelli are seen to be so important when their views can seemingly be summarized and exploded in a single lecture’s span.It is only with sufficient depth of study that a subject yields those mysteries and connections which are hidden from the untutored mind. We appeal to the ideal of liberal education of generations past but forget that theirs was also an education of depth and rigor that is altogether foreign to the dilettantism of our time. Our modern view is one that sees subjects as quarries—places to extract shallow wisdom from before moving on. In heeding this false idea of eclecticism we forget the words of John Henry Newman, a great proponent of liberal education, that the way to learn is “not to swallow knowledge but . . . to masticate and digest it.”The truth is this: Diversity of studies alone has no value. Its benefit, if any, derives entirely from what is studied and how well. Far better than to “cover all bases” is to achieve real proficiency and understanding in a meager few. And to truly understand we must, as Paul Samuelson put it, “go back for the second lesson.”It is common to think that depth of study necessarily precludes breadth; but in any field, no matter how rarefied, the threads of wider intellectual connections are always present, and all it takes to discover them is a curiosity to learn. For those who thus intend, there is an easy method: Trace an idea, equation or invention to its originator and understand their background, influences, and beliefs. Understand the world they lived in; notice names, events, concepts, categories. Proceeding by this thread, one encounters the vast interconnectedness of diverse human endeavors and begins to weave together the tapestry of human intellectual history in one’s own way.William Butler Yeats had a saying that one begins to understand the world by studying the cobweb in one’s own corner. Through intense rumination on a single subject, we gain not only knowledge into that subject but an internal awareness of both how it is practiced and how it is conceived of by its practitioners. Concentrated study confers upon on us the ability to imagine the ins and outs of a discipline — we come to have an tacit idea of its history, its methodology, and how it might develop — an understanding which provides the foundation for wider intellectual exploration by imbuing the tabula rasa of our minds with perspective and the faculty for synthesis.It is perhaps clear at this point that we mostly do not see learning in this way. We rely too much on the institutional framework, and it is the deeper failing of our current misconception of liberal education that we are unable to even think about intellectual exploration outside of the context of classes. Paradoxically, it would be a sign of Duke’s success if our intellectual discussions begin to consist less of “I took a class on . . .” or “I learned in a class about ...” and more of “I found an article on ...” or “I thought of this idea . . .” It would mean that we have recovered the agency in our learning that was the original objective of liberal education.Of course, taking classes that interest us and expand our horizons is important; but by themselves they are insufficient for the cultivation of a broad-ranging mind. We see a pertinent illustration of this in the case of reading: In subjects such as philosophy and literature, gleaning all the meaning from a text often takes revisiting it at a later date; but I would say that most of us do not do this. Ask someone to explain to you what they learned in a class last semester and they will likely be unable to formulate a coherent answer. We forget, because we tend to see our liberal arts classes rather like movies: entertainment to be enjoyed for a semester, but not something tethered to our own lives and intellectual development — even though the very success of a liberal education depends on the cultivation of one’s own intellectual framework. And this means reading, discussing, and thinking in one’s own time.Only when we begin to see Duke not as the source of our learning but a contributor to it do we open ourselves up to receive a transformative humanistic education. A true liberal education is not to be assessed by such crude notions as breadth and depth but only by the quality of the learning that takes place, a fact which is often lost when we speak in these abstractions. Depth can morph into breadth in learning just as readily as breadth leads on to depth; all it takes is the will and interest of the individual. After all, an education confined to the university setting is no liberation: Only self-motivated intellectualism can make us free.Marc Wang is a Trinity sophomore. "
Truth and civil discourse,"Jay A. Pearson, Douglas Brook",2024-10-29T12:00:00Z,Oct,29,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102924-pearson-brook-truth-civil-discourse-20241029.html,"In the era of culture wars and ideologically driven strife, belief in good faith communication has waned. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, we share lessons learned from two years of collaborating on a research project at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy examining racial bias in jury selection processes, and jury composition as well as efforts to improve them. Our shared identities bring similarities, some more obvious than others, which we viewed as a resource. We are both first-generation university graduates from humble beginnings and University of Michigan alums. We both teach graduate-level ethics courses, one addressing organizational challenges and the other identity stratification and social inequality. We have also shared brilliant students, and they brought us together to work on the project. However, because we are distinct individuals with our own lived experiences, there were also differences. One of us is a mid-50s center left Black American career academician, while the other a late-70s center right White American semi-retired federal official with decades of public service. Importantly, we learned that those differences were also a resource and how we agreed to combine them proved our greatest asset. We both share a deep and abiding love for the country and the liberal democratic republic we know as the United States of America. We both also appreciate social scientific “truth” as an accurate depiction of a sociological phenomenon considered in historical and contemporary context. This is distinct from individual, personal or ideologically informed experience, which is also an important type of truth — we call this “authenticity” instead. Commitment to rigorous scientific inquiry (truth) informed and guided our work from beginning to end. However, we also embraced the value of how different interpretive lenses (authenticity) highlighted different aspects of the very same studies and statistics we read and incorporated into our work. We leveraged shared commitments to truth and authenticity to engage and secure evidence informed public policy decision making. We like and respect each other, and consequently never shared a disrespectful or dismissive word. Civil discourse naturally characterized our interaction. While our interpretive lenses gave us slightly different levels of optimism on what our project would reveal, we always stuck to the evidence. In short, social scientific truth and authentic self were essential components of our civil discourse. Untruths, outright lies, deception and inauthenticity would have effectively dismantled our civil discourse enterprise.Substantively, we learned that we first had to agree on the truth. In this case, the social scientific truth, supported by both data and the literature, is that jury lists drawn from lists of licensed drivers and registered voters are not racially representative of the population of the jurisdiction. In racially minoritized communities of Black and Hispanic/Latino residents, those two groups are still disproportionately underrepresented in juries while white jurors were disproportionately overrepresented. Such racially unrepresentative juries correlate with a disparately high likelihood of convictions and harsher sentencing for Black and Latino defendants when compared to more racially and ethnically representative juries. These truths presented a policy problem that we could agree on, without having to attribute any causal inference.When we turned to addressing the problem, our respective authenticities came into play and remarkable synergies emerged. One of us attributed the unrepresentative source lists to historical structures and current systemic racism that manifests in fewer minority licensed drivers or registered voters. The other one of us attributed the unrepresentative jury lists to administrative evil, an undesirable result derived from uncritical application of commonly used processes by administrators.Over time, we began to view systemic racism and administrative evil as two parallel streams leading to the same problem. We also began to acknowledge each other’s authenticity as a positive contribution to our research. This enabled us to seek a solution to the policy problem without denigrating or dismissing one another’s authentically reached perspective, while achieving actionable solutions that addressed both systemic racism and administrative evil.Our material product was a set of suggested policy actions to mitigate challenges associated with racially non-representative jury selection processes. Also important, however, was our example of how to hold social scientific and authentic truths as core guiding principles when we worked collaboratively, respectfully and civilly across differences — and sometimes even mild disagreement — towards a common goal of improving the human condition.

Scientology and the dangers of neuroessentialism,Nik Narain,2024-10-28T12:00:00Z,Oct,28,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102824-narain-scientology-neuroessentialism-20241028.html,"When I was in Los Angeles last summer, I took the Scientology personality test at the famed Church of Scientology Information Center building right on Hollywood Boulevard. It’s a pristine white and mahogany building nestled incongruously between a Ripley’s Believe it or Not museum, a 4-star Indian restaurant, a Starbucks and the acclaimed Hollywood Egyptian Theater. I was sequestered in a small testing room where I took a 200-question personality test called the Oxford Capacity Analysis (OCA), followed by a 30-minute aptitude test called the Novis Mental Ability test and another shorter exam testing my cognitive reflexes. At the end of the examination, I sat for a one-on-one consultation where a Church of Scientology representative went over my results, which included a graphical representation of my OCA profile. According to the Church’s metrics, my personality scores fell in the low “ATTENTION URGENT” range, the range in which Scientologist teachings would cause a great numerical improvement. I was also informed of my terrible mental reflexes, and that my only saving grace as an overall profile was my higher-than-average IQ (not to flex).The representative had to step out momentarily to speak with another employee. In that 30-second window, I bolted out the back exit until I reached the Hollywood/Vine Subway station. To add another layer of depth to this story, I did this whole thing with my partner at the time, because I guess we thought it would be a good date idea. We saw Six the Musical afterward at the Pantages Theatre. The tonal shift of that evening was ridiculous.Now, the history of Scientology and the biography of its founder L. Ron Hubbard is worth several books and documentaries of its own. In short, a former science fiction author published a book called ""Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health"" as a set of practices aimed at healing mental disorders in the height of public mistrust about psychiatric therapy. The core idea of dianetics is that everyone has a rational, sound “analytical mind” that is often compromised by our “reactive mind,” haunted by what are called “engrams,” a type of mental picture from former memories that are thought to be the cause of all hardship. In dianetics, a process of “auditing” allows the individual to get “clear” of these engrams. Central to the process is the electropsychometer, or “e-meter,” which a Scientology minister employs to assess an individual’s mental state in response probing questions, similar to a lie detector. Dianetics became an instant sensation in the 1950s. In response to concerns from the FDA on its scientific validity (there was and has been very little scientific evidence supporting dianetics), Hubbard founded The Church of Scientology in 1952, turning dianetics from pop-psychology to a religious practice. While the current number of Scientologists is unknown, a 2007 article by journalist Kevin Collison reported 10 million practicing individuals worldwide, including 3.5 million in the U.S. Scientology is probably best known for attracting celebrities like John Travolta, Elizabeth Moss and Tom Cruise, the last of whom’s recent Paris Olympics closing ceremony appearance made headlines for its “weirdness” and “cult of personality” undertones. Most people view Scientology as a joke, a community practice that somehow feels disgraceful to both science and religion at the same time. A 2012 poll reported that 70% of Americans don’t think Scientology is a real religion, and almost any scientist you talk to will refuse Scientology as scientific. It’s also known for being ridiculously expensive, costing upwards of $300,000 to reach its highest levels. So what gives Scientology its cult following and devotional belief around a pseudo-medical practice?While there are several answers to the aforementioned question, I believe a large part of it boils down to neuroessentialism. Neuroessentialism is the reliance on viewing mental conditions as purely biological phenomena. While neuroessentialism has proven incredibly useful in driving advances in neuroscience research and empowering neurodiversity movements, the argument quickly goes too far when we start viewing “bad behavior” as a solely neurological shortcoming rather than a nuanced, interconnected and usually societal issue. The hyper-individualism of Scientology’s hack-your-mind-change-the-world rhetoric can easily serve as a form of scientifically-based gaslighting that absolves the accountability of institutions and/or relationships in creating mental hardship. When you’re taught that your brain is the sole cause of your suffering, it can problematize one’s fundamental being. Scientology also views many chronic illnesses and pain conditions as purely psychosomatic (meaning it arises from excessive anxiety and stress over a physical infection, injury or disability), which can be incredibly harmful to those with those conditions.Scientology’s neuroessentialist perspective is reinforced by its view of the brain as a purely computational object. Scientology sees the brain as a memory bank where auditing through e-meters functions as a physical “deprogramming” of these engram reserves. Dianetics is portrayed to work mechanistically which contrasts with the narrative of nonlinearity and gentleness framed around today’s cognitive behavioral therapy. Being strapped to an e-meter is invasive, aggressive and creates an illusion of accuracy in its operation. And Scientology’s impact on an individual is measured quantitatively in a reductionist sense. After all, you’re given a 2D graph of your personality and told to expect it to “increase” through the practices of Scientology.Neuroessentialism is so alluring because it provides a concrete, tangible explanation for something as illogical and ineffable as human behavior; it provides a sense of control in everyday mental turmoil. We’re always taught the only thing we can control is how we respond to situations, and Scientology offers a flashy model of doing so. Most people believe in the importance of science, and most people have a religious practice. Scientology can feel like this momentous connection between the two, a bridge between science and the spiritual, a biological essentialism to questions often regarded to be supernatural. But bringing an essentialist argument into a spiritual intervention is more fertile ground for psychiatric abuse than it is for self-transcendence.Neuroessentialism is an increasingly prevalent topic at the core of everything from international cults to mental health research. How much can changing our brain truly change our behavior? When will we see ourselves beyond a neurological essence when it comes to the alleviation of mental hardship? For now, it is safe to say that the expensive practices of Scientology will do little to alleviate said hardship, and the search for the intersection between psychiatry and the divine will continue. In the meantime, perhaps viewing the psychometric assessment tools of Scientology with a lens of curiosity and detached cynicism can be an intriguing, even entertaining way to spend an afternoon.Nik Narain is a Trinity senior.

"Five years after landmark case, Duke researchers must be alert ",Gary Jackson,2024-10-28T12:00:00Z,Oct,28,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102824-jackson-researchers-must-be-alert-20241028.html,"As an alumnus of Duke, I’m proud of my school’s preeminent stature and immense capabilities, but also concerned that those qualities should never sour into self-serving, possibly even criminal, conduct. It’s happened before, and it could happen again. Every year Duke attracts immense sums in federal research grants. In 2023, our School of Medicine took in more than $551 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In doing so, it jumped from No. 9 to No. 7 in national rankings of federal funding for academic medical centers (according to the Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research).This huge sum is funded by taxpayers. It then goes to research and development that may someday save your life or the lives of family members and friends. No doubt, Duke’s research has abated the suffering and even cured people close to me. But did you also know that 2024 marks the fifth anniversary of a landmark whistleblower action against Duke? A former Duke lab analyst alleged that researchers here submitted, in the words of the US Department of Justice, “applications and progress reports that contained falsified research on federal grants to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).”Duke agreed to pay the government $112.5 million for this alleged violation of the False Claims Act. “Taxpayers expect and deserve that federal grant dollars will be used efficiently and honestly,” said the US Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, “May this serve as a lesson that the use of false or fabricated data in grant applications or reports is completely unacceptable.”But this lesson was possible only because a whistleblower saw something amiss and decided to do the right thing. For his courage, he received more than $33.7 million from the settlement. Yes, you read that right. And this is a point that needs trumpeting at research-rich institutions such as Duke: Whistleblowers are not alone in their desire to do what’s right, and very well could be rewarded. Individuals who discover fraud — including those at universities — may feel overwhelmed and intimidated by the power of the institution that is home to the misconduct. It can seem like a David versus Goliath battle. But the False Claims Act (FCA) provides each David with an arsenal of incentives and weapons.Employees or others who have good reason to suspect an organization is cheating can file a qui tam (i.e. whistleblower) claim. Individuals who file whistleblower claims on behalf of the U.S. government may receive compensation anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of the total recovery in some cases.Further, the FCA offers whistleblowers protection from discrimination, termination, shortened work hours, demotions, an inhospitable work environment and other punishments an employer may consider.Whistleblowers don’t have to be superheros. They just require a sturdy moral compass and assurance that they can find allies ready to support them. I know from my days as an undergraduate and law student at Duke that the campus is blessed with an abundance of students and employees with moral courage and fortitude.And the truth is, we need folks like this more than ever. Whistleblowers have recently exposed potentially deadly situations at Boeing, for example. Whistleblowers are holding insurance companies accountable for shortchanging desperate homeowners following hurricanes, which is something our neighbors in western North Carolina could also face. What’s more, whistleblowers are always needed when taxpayer money earmarked for critical research is misappropriated. Duke is an extraordinary institution. Through a rogue and rare detour from its mission, the school paid dearly five years ago. Let that serve as a reminder for all of us in the university community to be vigilant in guarding Duke’s integrity.

Our computing conundrum,Aaron Siegle,2024-10-25T12:00:00Z,Oct,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102524-siegle-our-computing-conundrum-20241025.html,"It’s cliche to say that our lives are ""data driven."" But I can’t think of a more apt description of our modern society.Around the clock, we are constantly generating data. From smart watches tracking our sleep to the social media algorithms tailoring our digital experience, almost every action we take creates new electronic data, whether we realize it or not. With the advent of cloud computing in the early 2000s, the amount of data at our disposal seemed limitless. Cloud computing meant that we were no longer constrained by the hard drives on our local devices and could instead tap into the power of data centers, large warehouses storing the IT infrastructure that allows the internet to function. But nothing is ever really unlimited. Now, the rapid growth of AI is straining data centers and the power infrastructure needed to support them. The data center power demand is expected to double by 2030, with electricity generation unlikely to keep pace. Our society has entered an AI arms race, a dangerous game that ignores its environmental and social destruction. Like any technology, AI is not inherently evil, but it is being developed in a manner that lacks foresight. As a result, computing power has become the currency of the future, even as we fail to find enough electricity to power servers or sufficient guardrails to mitigate AI’s side effects. AI needs to become a tool for progress, not a product for competition The data centers, where AI workloads are processed, have significant environmental challenges. Packing so many servers into a tight space makes data centers very hot, which requires massive cooling systems to keep the servers operational. Large data centers require over 100 MW of power, the equivalent of 80,000 homes. Regarding water, water-based cooling systems use 208 million gallons of water a year, enough to fill a swimming pool that’s 10 miles long. The carbon emissions of both Microsoft and Google are heading in the wrong direction, with data centers being the primary culprit in both instances. A hidden impact of data centers is the waste they generate. Maintaining cutting-edge technology is essential in this industry, which means that many servers rich in critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt and copper, are thrown away as soon as the next model comes out — resulting in a lifespan of 1-2 years. These minerals cannot be wasted as they are valuable inputs to many technologies needed for the energy transition, such as solar panels and electric vehicle batteries. This excessive waste is particularly common in crypto mining, where miners need the newest application-specific integration circuit (ASIC) to remain competitive. Simply because AI has negative environmental impacts doesn’t mean that the technology can’t help our society. Because big tech companies have instituted ambitious sustainability targets, data centers have served as conduits for adding renewable energy to the electric grid. Data centers account for two-thirds of corporate renewable energy purchases, making the industry a major financier of renewable energy. Given the large energy requirements of data centers, it is essential that they are powered by carbon-free electricity sources such as solar, wind and nuclear instead of by fossil fuels. Additionally, AI can create new insights to better decarbonize industrial processes and promote energy efficiency. Here at Duke, we are experiencing the benefits of AI and large-scale computing. The Duke Compute Cluster (DCC) is a network of computing resources that community members can use to perform computationally advanced tasks, such as reading DNA sequences and training machine learning algorithms. Without access to the DCC, Duke would not be the dynamic research institution that it is today.So how do we balance the positive impacts of AI with its negative side effects?I believe the answer lies in shifting AI development from an arm’s race to a collaborative process. Government agencies and big tech companies leading the industry see AI advancement as a race, where speed is prioritized over safety. The problem with this perspective is that AI development is viewed as a zero-sum game, with discrete winners and losers. Those that amass the most computing resources will gain superiority over everyone else and control the global economic system, or so the thinking goes. An arm’s race approach will result in a misallocation of AI resources towards solving esoteric mathematical equations instead of the world’s most pressing challenges, as we’ve seen with cryptocurrency. AI is only as impactful as the task it is assigned to solve. Another impact of AI that is seldom considered is the information treadmill it creates. In other words, AI is needed to manage AI. Data centers are a perfect example of this. These facilities which are built to hold AI servers are operated by AI-powered software to manage the ever more complex server networking AI requires. AI generates more data than human could ever interpret unassisted. So, more AI is used to extract key insights. This trend also impacts human workflows. For example, many programmers have noticed that they now spend more time debugging code written by AI than they would if they had written the code de novo. In sum, AI creates the need for more AI, which results in a positive feedback loop that is difficult to break. First, AI systems should be reconfigured to better match spatiotemporal variations in renewable energy. The big tech companies that dominate AI have global data center portfolios that are synced thanks to the advent of virtualization. Companies should redirect computing loads to data centers in regions that are powered by large amounts of renewable energy. This will optimize wind and solar resources while also lowering the carbon footprint associated with AI.Second, consumers should rethink their digital footprint and take stock of the ways they maybe be inadvertently generating data. Rejecting cookies, limiting the use of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and deleting unused apps on your phone are all good places to start. Remember that everything you do online corresponds to server usage in a data center.Finally, use the devices you have for as long as possible. Our electronic devices are full of critical minerals and require significant amounts of energy to manufacture. Upgrades on new devices are often barely noticeable, as the core components of an iPhone have barely changed since 2007. Avoid buying a new device if your old one is still in working order.AI has made the fight against climate change even more challenging. AI is a double-edged sword, producing more emissions while helping to reduce emissions throughout the economy. Responsible AI development is needed to mitigate the environmental impacts of computing. Even if they seem negligible to us, our choices as consumers do make a difference.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity junior. His pieces typically run on alternate Fridays."
A requiem for the Duke student from the middle of nowhere,Cara Eaton,2024-10-25T12:00:00Z,Oct,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102524-eaton-requiem-from-middle-of-nowhere-20241025.html,"If I were a director with some absurdist quality to my work (à la Charlie Kaufman) and I were to create some satirical depiction of Duke admissions, I’d film them drawing a map of the U.S.. The camera would pan in to show that they’ve penciled the entire country as a series of key cities and towns: New York, L.A., Westchester, the entire state of New Jersey … I think New England, my home region, would be represented by a few elite boarding schools that funnel students to Duke, and maybe also Greenwich, Connecticut. (Although anyone up there will tell you that’s not really New England; they’re Yankees fans.)This is a highly satirical representation of where Duke students are from, since the highest percentage hail from here in North Carolina. Still, it seems as if students from those key elite areas seem to be the most visible. It’s no fault of theirs at all, and there’s no shame in being from a fashionable area. It’s also not Duke’s fault for admitting these highly talented students. The problem, if there is one, is fostered somewhat organically: Students from valued areas seem to have more connections off the bat and better luck moving forward throughout their years at Duke.It’s quite logical. If you live in a city or area dense with other admitted Duke students, you come in with connections. Localized meetups before freshman year help facilitate these relationships. I believe my meetup, which was forall of New England, took place in Boston. If you live in Boston, easy enough. However, if you’re from the other 99.999% of this 71,988 sq mi area, it may not be as simple. And if you’re from a rural area hours removed from a city, you’re just out of luck.Or, take the Greek rush process. In my short stint rushing, I was asked what high school I went to after I revealed where I was from. ""How would these girls possibly know my high school?"" I wondered. Was I not to believe they hoped to hear a famous name? My friend from small-town California, somewhat similarly, was asked if she lived near celebrities. Plenty of others have written about the fetishization of wealth that is embedded in the concept of the Greek system, and that’s not my point of interest.I’m not even sure wealth is the premier issue here. It’s hard to place down exactly why some areas correlate (however loosely) with better experiences at Duke besides the dumb luck of better connections. The girls interviewing us may have just been looking to relate based on shared experiences of themselves or their friends. A faultless phenomenon. It’s the natural consequence of an admissions system that favors certain high schools or areas for some reason or another and thus unconsciously creates certain ingroups.Of course, writing about New England like it’s an area lacking in privilege is laughable for the land of Harvard and Yale. On that note, in said universities, I’m sure there’s similar congestion from certain cities and areas, and thus the same cultural issue I describe. The actual demographic distribution is certainly a bit different, as being only one of two in the Class of 2027 from my home state would likely not be the case there, although certain Wyoming-esque areas probably are similar across the board in meager representation. The goal then here, a populist notion, is to create a Duke (or Harvard, or Yale) that is no less advantaged to the rural public schooler than to the classmate from the Upper East Side. How exactly to undo a deeply ingrained social and cultural occurrence, well, I’ll leave that up to our sociology department.I can’t leave this article without anticipating protests that socioeconomic inequality is the real issue here, not shallow social indicators like the area of origin. However right you may be, I’ll leavethat up to a writer who’s read just a little more Marx than me.Cara Eaton is a Trinity sophomore."
The conscienceless Micheal Parsons and fake Christian values,Ethan Khorana,2024-10-25T12:00:00Z,Oct,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102524-khorana-conscienceless-micheal-parsons-20241025.html,"On an early morning in what is believed to be the years 30-40 of the Common Era, Jesus Christ arrived to teach his disciples on a mountainous ridge that overlooked the city of Jerusalem, called the Mount of Olives. The place is named for the silvery green olive groves that once covered its slopes and is said to be the location where Jesus Christ would eventually ascend to Heaven. The Bible says that Jesus’s teachings were interrupted by a group of people who brought forward a woman who was caught in the act of prostitution. The group said ""Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?"" The group asked for the permission of Jesus to throw stones at the lady until she died as a form of punishment. As they continued questioning him, Jesus put his finger into the ground and began drawing in the dirt. Eventually, the Messiah straightened his back and spoke the infamous words, ""Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."" Jesus then began to draw in the dirt again. A silence filled the area and one by one members of the group left. Then only Jesus Christ and the lady who had committed adultery remained. Jesus straightened his back to speak again. He told the lady that there was no one left to condemn her sins, as every member of the group that wanted to kill her had also committed sins in their lifetime. He then told her to leave him and live her life free of sin as a form of redemption. That morning on the mountaintop, Jesus chose not to allow the lady to die and pronounced death as a form of penalty to be immoral. On a Tuesday afternoon, around 2,000 years later, Missouri Governor Mike Parsons was brought the same question as Jesus Christ once was. The Governor was asked by the Innocence Project and thousands of Americans to stop the killing of Marcellus Williams, who had been placed on death row in Missouri for the killing of Felicia Gayle, a former reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The victim, Felicia Gayle was found stabbed to death in her home in August of 1998. Her murderer left behind fingerprints, footprints, hair and a trace of DNA on the murder weapon; however, none of this forensic evidence matched the DNA of Marcellus Williams. According to the Innocence Project, the case against Marcellus Williams was based on two individuals, who were promised money and leniency for their own pending trials to testify against Williams. Additionally, the prosecution gained testimonies from Williams's cellmate and ex-girlfriend, who provided no real evidence against Williams, and both were known to fabricate testimonies. After this prosecution, Williams sat in Missouri prison for years, and for years his conviction was questioned. The now fifty-five-year-old has avoided the death penalty many times due to a lack of evidence against him. In fact, former Governor of Missouri Eric Grietens halted the execution of Marcellus Williams and created a Board of Inquiry to investigate his innocence. Once current Governor Mike Parsons took office, however, that Board was abruptly dissolved without ever creating a report or recommendation on the killing. Immediately after the board was dissolved, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey set an execution date for Marcellus Williams, despite the family of the victim asking that the state not execute Marcellus Williams and the prosecutor who once litigated against Williams moving to vacate his conviction. In order to ensure Williams's death, the Attorney General then got special permission from the Supreme Court of Missouri, for a writ of prohibition, which undermined the family of the victim’s resolution to avoid the death penalty for Williams. The date of Sept. 24 was then set for Marcellus Williams to be executed. In the days leading up to the execution, thousands of Americans grouped together, alongside the Innocence Project, to ask the Governor of Missouri to grant clemency to Williams and prevent his death. Clemency was something only he could grant as Governor of the state. The group awaited his decision, just as the group did in Jerusalem thousands of years ago. Unlike Jesus, however, Governor Mike Parsons declined to halt the killing of Marcellus Williams and on September 24th Williams was killed by lethal injection in front of his son. In 2022, Governor Parsons was scrutinized for saying that he would only appoint a state health director who shared his ""Christian values."" In 2017, Governor Parsons said he did not believe in the morality of being gay because of his ""Christian beliefs."" In the Governor’s final State of the State speech, he highlighted what he called a ""fight for life"" through his passing of one of the strictest abortion bans in the country. I disagree with the morality of all these takes. Nevertheless, Governor Parsons has made it clear that he uses, his view of, Christian values to guide his decision-making as Governor. However, on that September afternoon in Missouri, Governor Parsons rejected the very words of Christ himself. The Governor believed he was justified in his decision to execute Marcellus Williams because he believed Williams was guilty. According to the Bible, it didn’t matter if Williams was guilty or not. Jesus Christ directly rejected the idea of death being used as a form of punishment for those who are guilty of committing sin. The sad truth is that Governor Mike Parsons since taking office has never granted clemency to the death penalty. There is no reason Governor Parsons should not have known this Christian belief, as sixty-nine faith leaders sent him a letter urging him not to let Marcellus Williams die. Their letter requesting clemency for Marcellus said, ""God/Allah looks upon us. He knows our faults, he knows our weaknesses, he knows our sins better than we know our own, from the smallest to the greatest. He knows the difficulties and harm. Marcellus has been accused of and has brought upon others. While He knows it, He looks on Marcellus, made in His image and likeness, and continues to love Marcellus despite his wrongs."" These leaders, who were Christian, Muslim and Jewish, showcased a belief in redemption and that all life is sacred. Their letter displayed what real Christian values are.Governor Parsons cannot pick and choose when to use Christian values. He can not support a right to life and also support state-sanctioned killing. He can not perch his belief system upon a Bible that he consistently has chosen not to follow. Parsons’ use of fake Christian values is seemingly a pattern amongst Republican politicians. These Republicans use the Bible and Christianity as nothing more than a political prop to garner voters and excuse their immortality. It can be seen in politicians such as former President Donald Trump who stripped children from their parents and threw them in cages at the border, and who now has garnered 300,000 dollars from the selling of his own merchandised Bible. It can also be seen through people like Arizona Rep. Justin Heap who advanced a bill that would allow residents to legally kill undocumented immigrants, or through the dozens of Republicans who sat face to face with the parents of the young children killed in the Sandy Hook mass shooting and watched the parents shed tears over their dead children, just to decline to pass any legislation that would truly stop guns from harming children ever again. How is it that these Christian Republicans can believe in a Gospel that states we are all made in God's image but support the entrapment of children, and the shooting of migrant and elementary school students? It is time that the Christian electorate considers if the actions of these politicians truly embody the life that Christ lived and the lessons he taught. Ethan Khorana is a Trinity first-year.

Finding the known in the unknown as a medical student away from home,Nathan Luzum,2024-10-24T12:00:00Z,Oct,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102424-luzum-known-in-unknown-20241024.html,"Being in a crowd of unknown people is simultaneously freeing and terrifying. This was one takeaway from the beginning of my fourth year of medical school. At the start of the year, students applying into certain specialties undertake ""away rotations"" at other institutions before applying to residency positions. These are viewed as month-long opportunities to showcase preference and dedication to specific programs, explore life in different cities, and allow more people to put a name to a face. Conversely, they also allow applicants to evaluate programs and their culture, getting a sense of life as a resident.Some people use these rotations as a chance to signal strong interest in a particular city or area — near a significant other, for instance — but for someone like me who doesn’t feel particularly tied down, I rotated in St. Louis and New York, close to family and friends, respectively. It was in these environments, walking down hospital hallways staring into a sea of unknown faces, that I often reflected on my anonymity. After spending a considerable amount of time at Duke, it’s become nearly a guarantee that I’ll recognize a few faces on any stroll around the hospital. Removing this comforting reinforcement of familiarity opens up the opportunity — and terror — for redefining one’s identity. During these rotations, I often thought about identity formation, or how we conceive of our place in the world around us. To me, it seemed as if that world had entirely changed.Most psychologists point to adolescence as the time when we begin to question and explore identity, arriving at some semblance of who we are. But this initial conclusion about who we are is not immutable. Even once our identity is preliminarily formed, continual re-examination of our personality and values resurfaces from time to time, especially during major life changes. Many younger people may describe the transition from high school to college or from college to post-graduate life as soul-searching periods where aspects of their identity were modified or fortified.I wrestled with this notion after moving to St. Louis, then New York, waffling between feeling liberated and intimidated. At times, it was empowering — I thought about how I could show up to the grocery store in mismatched clothes and face no societal repercussions from people I knew. Then I realized I often go shopping in Durham in poorly coordinated outfits, which made the whole exercise seem much less novel. Spending more time at each new hospital, I noticed myself growing increasingly comfortable and confident with trying out subtly different approaches in engaging with patients or carrying myself in the operating room. Being in a new place made these efforts easier, without the habitual environment to reinforce my usual traits and tendencies. This decision to try out new approaches wasn’t confined just to the hospital, though, as I expanded my comfort zone by exploring my new environments solo. I started out small, facing my fears by dining and attending movies alone. Finding the experience not nearly as scary as anticipated, I began expanding my journeys and eventually found myself riding to the top of the Gateway Arch or climbing to the crown of the Statue of Liberty, accompanied by only the kind strangers I met along the way. I adopted a mentality of agency in planning my activities without restricting myself only to times when others were available, leading me to feel more fulfilled.Reading this, you might get the impression that I was completely lame and totally friendless in these cities. I want to assure you that I did not amble about on my lonesome all the time. Really, catching up with college friends and meeting other medical students living in the area were highlights of my time away. In fact, I began finding familiarity in places I least expected. Walking along a random street in St. Louis, I ran into someone I knew from college (a former upper masthead Chronicle editor, no less) and we made a plan to catch up over lunch. Strolling around one evening in New York, I happened to see another college friend — yes, you guessed it, another former Chronicle editor. In the hospital, I’d reconnect in happenstance elevator rides with people I shared college classes with who were now residents. Small connections began to pop up everywhere, whether it was meeting someone from my hometown in Kansas or eating somewhere that reminded me of a favorite Durham restaurant.These encounters felt like brief glimpses of the known in a foreign landscape. As time went on, though, I realized that there were far more familiar elements than I first appreciated. Even in a new environment, I wasn’t completely unmoored from my past and my values. Both inside the hospital and out, the known became more apparent. Echoing through the noise of novelty was the everlasting importance of empathy toward patients and determination to develop the best possible plan, even if the faces and buildings surrounding me were unusual. It was my past experiences — reinforced by continual reminders of familiarity circulating around me — coupled with the relocation-related feeling of freedom that subtly reformed my sense of identity. Interrogating ourselves is an important part of life — it enables us to grow, change our opinions and become better versions of ourselves. Few things are entirely new, and we can often find roots of the past in uncharted territory. Regardless of where I end up for my residency training next year, I’ll hope to carry forward that philosophy. Growing as a person requires us to embrace the new while appreciating the old, continually blending our past and present.Nathan Luzum is a fourth-year medical student and a member of the DSPC Board of Directors.

Trash talk: Duke’s disconnect with a sustainable future,"Annie Ming Kowalik, Jakob Hagedorn",2024-10-24T12:00:00Z,Oct,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102424-ming-kowalik-trash-tralk-duke-sustainable-20241024.html,"Ed Sheeran. Ed Sheeran is playing a concert. Here!?The Centennial Founders' Day Celebration was incredible, from the headline performance to the amazing acapella group and distinguished speakers. It’s an experience that blew our minds away. But as we listened, something felt a bit ironic. Rousing speeches questioned students and faculty alike: ""Who will write this story? It’s a story about saving lives and our planet."" Here was a university dedicated to educating future leaders and inspiring genuine good. Yet its day-to-day practices seem to tell a different story. For all its emphasis on a sustainable future, Duke, like many American universities, relies heavily on single-use plastics and disposable dining items. This raises an uncomfortable question: Can a school that speaks so passionately about saving the planet truly call itself a sustainability leader?Excited to dabble in investigative journalism, we’ve been tracking our waste production. Spending five days dining on Duke’s campus, we each used 15 single-use containers, 17 plastic utensils — 3 with additional plastic wrapping — and 6 single-use cups. If we were to follow this routine year-round, together we’d accumulate over 1600 plastic items just from meals alone. Each piece of plastic could take 400 years to decompose. Multiplied across Duke’s student body, the environmental cost is exponential. In total, U.S. college students contribute more than 200 million tons of waste annually, and much of it is single-use plastic. This cultural convenience comes with a heavy, lasting footprint​. What is also interesting is that there are reusable containers, but they are rarely seen. You cannot use them when you mobile order, and you have to ask for them in the restaurants. The default choice is the unsustainable one. ""But many of our reusable containers have cardboard portions or are made of paper,"" you might argue. However, conducting a general survey around the various garbage bins on campus, we unfortunately found that this recyclable component had been incongruously mixed with other trash, and eventually unceremoniously carted off as general waste to a landfill.Meanwhile, Annie Ming's friends studying at universities in the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, experience an entirely different environment. NSW recently enacted strict single-use plastic bans, including bans on ""biodegradable"" PLA objects, forcing institutions to adopt sustainable practices. As a result, Australian students often dine using reusable dishware or eco-friendly alternatives like wooden utensils and paper containers. Enlisting friends to record their waste and averaging it out, Australian student weekly plastic use is minimal — on average, they use five disposable items a week. For those living on campus, the dining hall is outfitted with strictly reusable plates and cutlery, and leftover food is separated to compost. Whilst Duke has similarly banned single-use plastic, it did not ban PLA alternatives. As mentioned in this March article, PLA will only decompose under a set of specific conditions and will take up to a century to degrade in landfills. This sustainable approach isn’t just a choice; it’s a matter of policy. NSW’s legislation is designed to reduce plastic waste by 30% by 2025, setting a national standard that universities must follow. Duke, however, lacks comparable regulations. While Duke offers recycling programs, North Carolina has no single-use plastic bans or strong incentives for universities to adopt eco-friendly options. Duke’s sustainability efforts, in this context, feel limited and largely voluntary, making it challenging to achieve the same standards of environmental stewardship seen at Australian universities​. The Freie Universitaet Berlin, Jakob's home university, goes one step further and does not provide any opportunities for non-permanent takeaway containers. Each student is expected to bring a Tupperware container from home or borrow one from a friend. This drastically simplifies the system, removing the need for the expensive recycling methods described above. Another difference that struck us was not only the packaging but also the waste of leftovers, especially meat. Jakob's cafeteria in Berlin is mostly meat-free, and the fish and meat dishes are only served on special days or traditions (e.g. fish on Friday, due to Europe’s religious history). This subtly reduces consumption and waste of the most resource-intensive part of our diet. In addition, meals can be portioned by the consumer in a buffet style, which reduces the need for large servings. To be fair, a few U.S. universities in states like California have adopted similar bans on single-use plastics, and some campuses offer reusable options. But across the country, American universities generally lag behind Australian and German institutions, where eco-friendly practices are embedded in campus life and enforced by state-backed policies. While American students carry disposable cups and cutlery between classes, their Australian counterparts seem to have mastered a low-waste routine, largely thanks to policy-backed infrastructure.Up to this point, we merely reiterate problems that have been previously identified. But to merely comment on these issues would be documentation, not action. Thus, to make the Duke waste system better, here are various changes, from small to big, we recommend:Make the already present reusable containers a priority. By choosing to forgo the brief convenience of a single-use container, you would be saving, on average, 1.4 gallons (5.3 l) of water, 32 Megajoules of energy, preserving 29 ounces (1.1 kg) of CO2 from being released into the atmosphere. Separate your trash. All our conservation efforts are for naught if in the final most crucial step they fail. Americans generated 35.7 million tons of plastic waste in 2018, of which only 8.7% was recycled, with most ending up in landfills or incinerators. Choose to reduce your meat consumption. Jakob’s analysis of his meals across the past week show an average ratio of meat to non-meat of about 80:20; by reducing it to 50:50, leaps can be made in conservation. Livestock farming is responsible for about 14.5% of all global greenhouse gas emissions.Control portion size, not one size fits all. Standard portion sizes often result in overproduction and waste, contributing to the 30-40% of food supply that ends up as food waste in the U.S. Allowing consumers to choose the amount they need not only reduces food waste but also minimizes resource depletion associated with unnecessary production, transportation, and disposal.Demand better policy. One of the biggest dangers in focusing on individual action is losing sight of bigger stakeholders. The university itself has the ultimate power here, and a wonderful step that would result in overwhelming change would be to ban the use of single-use plastics, including PLA alternatives. Indeed this has been done across the nation, with Princeton enacting a ban of plastic water bottles, bags, straws, and utensils in 2018.So, what obstacles remain?A major obstacle to implementing these proposals is that WU is made up of individual vendors. They all have individual contracts with Duke Dining and control most of the pricing and staffing. This decentralized system, integrated into the centralized system (food points, mobile ordering), makes it difficult to adjust things like meat-related food prices.We cannot just deflect the blame. As students, we have a habitual reliance on convenience. Although we intellectually bemoan the dangers of climate change, we nonetheless use needless plastic because it makes it easier to take to class. The student body must choose to model sustainable behavior, just as Duke must choose to address sustainability through structural change.For Duke and other American universities truly committed to ""writing a story about saving lives and our planet,"" it’s time to re-evaluate campus practices. Embracing sustainable policies and reducing single-use plastics could transform university waste production and help align everyday actions with the grander vision Duke promotes. Perhaps, as Duke’s leaders urged, it’s time to rethink who gets to write this story — and what kind of legacy we really want to leave behind.Annie Ming Kowalik is a visiting international student from the University of New South Wales.Jakob Hagedorn is a visiting international student from Berlin, Germany.

Duke needs College Republicans — here’s why,"Sherman Criner, Zander Pitrus",2024-10-24T12:00:00Z,Oct,24,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102424-criner-pitrus-duke-needs-college-republicans-20241024.html,"Picture this: A conservative voice in North Carolina politics, John Hood, delivers a speech at Duke’s Sanford School. The topic? ""American Conservatism 101"" — a wonderful opportunity for students to engage directly with traditional Republican thought that isn’t often available on campus. Yet, as Mr. Hood’s presentation echoed through the room, we could not help but wonder: Where is everyone? The surprising lack of attendance, though somewhat atypical of nominally Republican or conservative events, raises some uncomfortable questions about our campus’s commitment to intellectual diversity. Does Duke celebrate conservative or Republican voices? And are conservative or Republican voices actually welcome?Consider another event at Duke featuring a conservative speaker — an interview with Congresswoman Liz Cheney. At the event, Cheney endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for President. The event drew effusive praise from Duke students and faculty, who lauded Cheney’s courage in opposing former President Trump’s alleged plans to ""destroy American democracy."" Duke ostensibly appears to be committed to free speech, bipartisanship and open inquiry, right?Had Cheney spoken at Duke fifteen years ago about her strong pro-life convictions, then Duke ought to be praised for its willingness to platform ideas the institution itself finds repulsive. But that is not what happened. Instead, Duke invited one of the most vocal critics of the Republican presidential nominee to speak about ""Defending Democracy,"" a phrase that has been the de facto campaign slogan of the last two Democratic Party presidential campaigns. Ask yourself, is it really bipartisanship if a Republican speaks before an audience of presumably mostly Democrats and endorses the Democratic presidential nominee? Perhaps Cheney made a compromise, but what controversial, hard-line conservative stance did the Duke community compromise on? Irrespective of one’s opinion of the former president, Cheney or the meaning of ""Defending Democracy,"" we cannot consider this event an earnest attempt at tolerance or promoting Republican voices.Some may retort that inviting former Senator Richard Burr, a current Trump supporter who ironically voted for impeachment, to speak at Duke was a step in the right direction. Perhaps platforming a Trump supporter shows that Duke is serious about its newfound commitment to free speech. However, Duke did not originally invite him with the intention of focusing on his conservative principles or his support of the Republican presidential nominee. Instead his ""Bridging the Divide"" event was centered around civil discourse and free expression — seemingly the only topic Republicans supporting Trump can speak about at Duke.This pattern is revealing. If Duke only encourages Republicans to discuss ""safe"" topics, such as bipartisanship, civil discourse and anti-Trumpism, can the University honestly claim to ""stand for freedom of expression, painful though it may be?"" If traditionally Republican voices are only welcome when they align with the campus orthodoxy, how can we pretend to value genuine bipartisanship? True tolerance requires something to tolerate. It calls us to extend the same respect to opposing views that we desire for our own, especially those we find most disagreeable. If we instead prejudge an opinion as unworthy of any platform, then we directly endanger that ""fragile thing"" of freedom which has sustained our national experiment all these years.At this point, we could rattle off various facts like that only 14.28% of the Class of 2027 identifies as conservative, that Duke’s civility-minded professors are leaving for UNC-Chapel Hill’s new School of Civic Life and Leadership, or that Duke issues institutional statements and emails condemning conservative policies. Needless to say, the majority of Duke students keenly understand that our campus will not tolerate certain opinions.The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression’s (FIRE) 2025 College Free Speech Rankings report on Duke University specifically delineate that merely 26% of students feel ""very"" or ""somewhat"" comfortable expressing an unpopular political opinion to their fellow students on a social media account tied to their name; 72% believe ""shouting down a speaker"" is acceptable conduct, compared to the 39% of Duke students who believe ""using violence"" is acceptable; and only about a third (31%) ""say it is 'extremely' or 'very' clear that their administration protects free speech on campus.""To put it bluntly, the Duke community needs to understand and be exposed to the views held by millions of Americans. If we truly desire tolerance and civil discourse, then we need a campus that fairly represents both of America’s parties.Hence, today we announce the establishment of Duke College Republicans.Though we do not expect every member to agree with everything the Republican Party stands for, we do believe promoting unrepresented yet widely-held ideas is a noble goal, especially at an institution hoping to create the next generation of leaders. This group will serve dual purposes: providing right-wing students with a much-needed sense of belonging and challenging progressive students to sharpen their ideological foundations through genuine debate and dialogue.True tolerance is not about silencing dissent or creating an echo chamber of agreeable opinions. It is about fostering an environment where diverse viewpoints can coexist, clash and ultimately strengthen one another. By embracing genuine ideological diversity, Duke can transcend the hollowness of empty commitments to bipartisanship and become an institution truly dedicated to ""unfettered debate and deliberation.""We call on every member of the Duke community — students, faculty, and administration alike — to embrace this call to listen. Because, when we close ourselves off, we can quickly forget that we share the desire to build a better world. A former president once said: ""That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t challenge [those you disagree with]. Have the confidence to challenge them, the confidence in the rightness of your position. There will be times when you shouldn’t compromise your core values, your integrity, and you will have the responsibility to speak up in the face of injustice. But listen. Engage. If the other side has a point, learn from them. If they’re wrong, rebut them. Teach them. Beat them on the battlefield of ideas.""These words were pulled directly from former President Obama's 2016 commencement address at Howard University. That a Democratic president's words resonate so deeply with our call for Republican voices highlights a universal truth: the power of open dialogue transcends party lines. By embracing this ethos, we don't just improve our campus — we cultivate the skills vital for leadership in our diverse nation. True tolerance, genuine engagement and the willingness to grapple with challenging ideas are not just academic exercises; they are the foundation of a robust republic.

Between the marvelous and the mundane,Advikaa Anand,2024-10-23T12:00:00Z,Oct,23,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102324-anand-marvelous-and-mundane-20241023.html,"I have always been someone who has craved excitement. When I was younger, this fascination with adventure led me to exhilarating exploits. I would venture into the woods near our house, exploring the remnants of old stone shelters and hidden water pools in the forests. I would insist on riding the roller coaster rides with the most extreme drops in theme parks. I would beg my dad to turn on roads we’d never seen before in search of a new place. So when I came to college for the first time, this innate thirst for thrill was finally quenched. Here was a new experience to be uncovered at every turn: new friends and new classes and new struggles and new victories as I grew accustomed to living on my own for the first time. The exciting wave of unearthing such novelties endured through my sophomore year, as I moved onto West Campus. I wandered around my quad in awe of the magnificent architecture surrounding me, marveling at the way the street lamps cast dancing shadows on the stone walls at night. It seemed surreal that the outside of my residence resembled a palace. I took classes in the Sanford building for the first time, a momentous milestone as a Public Policy major, becoming more integrated into a community of individuals that shared my academic passions and extracurricular interests. I relished the privilege of being able to eat at WU three times a day (although I quickly grew weary of this). Then I became a junior. And nothing seemed new anymore. Nothing seemed exciting. I came back to campus at the beginning of this year, anticipating new adventures. But instead, all aspects of my daily life, from my meals to my walks to class, seemed to become a tired dance with an old partner. Suddenly, my feet began to hurt, and my body didn’t quite sway to the rhythm the way it used to. It seemed as though my ears had grown weary of the same music. I think we all reach a point in our college careers where college loses the charm it once boasted. What was once marvelous becomes mundane and suddenly, we find ourselves trapped in a trite routine that no longer seems fulfilling. But I think what we fail to realize is that this apparent sense of “boring” is also what characterizes real life. When we venture out of our insulated college bubble into the gallows of the real world, each day will not hold the promise of adventure but instead the regularity of routine. As mundane as it may seem, we must grow accustomed to the promise of certainty in our days: a certain time to wake up, the same commute to and from work every day, the chores waiting for us as soon as we walk through the door and the mindless chatter of TV to numb our minds before we go to sleep. I think there lies a certain comfort in predictability that we must learn to embrace. After all, the only certainty in life is its uncertainty. We have no way of knowing for sure where we will be in a year and what circumstances will dominate our lives. Sure, we may have a wager at the semblance our life may hold, but that’s about it. And so, knowing at least what the next day will consist of lends us something to hold onto when our sense of control seems to be slipping away. And as jarring as this transition might be, like treading a rickety bridge with no support on either side, it is necessary. Because to know what is marvelous, we must first master the mundane.

Biden’s Israel policy has been a disaster. Don’t be fooled into thinking Trump’s would be better.,Leo Goldberg,2024-10-23T12:00:00Z,Oct,23,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102324-goldberg-biden-trump-israel-policy-20241023.html,"Two years ago, I watched with dismay as Joe Biden unveiled his foreign policy agenda for the Middle East. Speaking in Saudi Arabia in July of 2022, he outlined a generic vision involving a continued US presence in the region to protect American interests, such as combatting the influence of Russia, China and Iran to ensure the US remained the sole hegemon. He also made a vague commitment to furthering human rights while speaking in a country notorious for its human rights violations.What could have been a chance for Biden to bring a fresh foreign policy to a region which desperately needs it ended up being an evasive disappointment. Rather than addressing the root causes of turmoil in the Middle East, namely foreign imperial intervention, he chose to continue implementing the same failed status quo, and showed he had absolutely nothing original or creative to offer in the realm of diplomacy. To top it all off, Biden commemorated the occasion by giving the Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman a fist bump to show his camaraderie. Yes, Joe Biden actually greeted the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia by fist-bumping him.I knew the trip was an early sign that Biden's Middle East policy would prove to be impotent, and he by no means let me down. Biden’s record in the Middle East since has been about as impressive as the trip itself, which is most apparent in his utter failure to competently address Israel’s ongoing war on Gaza.Israel’s policy of warfare has created a humanitarian crisis of horrific proportions in Gaza. We’ve watched over the last year as Israel has pulverized the infrastructure of the beleaguered district, decimating the hospital, school, and sanitation systems and continue to starve its populace through a siege which has blocked a majority of international aid from being administered.In addition to the 40,000 Gazans who have lost their lives in the brutal occupation, 90% of Gaza’s 2 million people have been displaced, half are at risk of imminent starvation and an entire generation of Gazan children have been traumatized by the immense scale of death and destruction. As a result, these children will grow up violently embittered towards Israel and thus likely to turn to the same ugly ideology which drove Hamas’ attack on October 7th.To all of this, President Biden has willingly provided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a steady supply of arms, regardless of how those arms are used to violate international law. Biden’s weak calls for military restraint and greater safety for civilians have been easily brushed aside by Netanyahu, who has danced circles around Biden for the last year. Despite this, Israel continues to enjoy unwavering arms shipments from the US and impunity for the disgraceful ways in which it uses them, making apparent the sobering fact that Israel is now essentially dictating US foreign policy. The Biden administration’s tremendous bungling on Gaza has rightly been scorned by many factions of the Democratic party, translating into trouble for Kamala Harris as she battles to win critical swing states, most crucially the state of Michigan. Arab Americans, who constitute a sizable portion of Michigan’s population, are a vital voting bloc for the Democrats, and helped give Biden the edge in 2020 which won him the state. Many of these same voters, though, have considerably cooled towards Biden, and Harris by extension, over the Gaza crisis, and consequently have even begun turning to Trump as an alternative. Figures such as Amer Ghalib, the Democrat mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, the only Muslim-majority city in America, endorsed Trump, signaling a backlash against the complicity of the Biden-Harris administration regarding Gaza. Like Ghalib, many Arab Americans, and Americans in general, believe Trump will offer something better for the Palestinians, critically endangering Harris’ chances of winning in Michigan, and therefore perhaps the entire election itself.This belief that Donald Trump presents a viable solution to the failings of Biden and Harris over Israel, which is driving the decisions of many voters in places like Michigan, is a dangerous mistake. Despite the current administration’s deeply problematic response to the crisis, Trump is not the logical answer to Biden’s mishandling of Gaza that many think he is. His record on Israel was one of gleeful deference to Netanyahu and of grave peril to the Palestinian cause, and would be again. In 2017, Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved the US embassy there, upending decades of US policy and rebuking the goal of keeping the city a neutral area over which no religious or political faction could exercise more of a claim than another. The move completely delegitimized the Palestinian right to East Jerusalem and sent the implicit message that the famously multicultural and multi-religious city was to be the sole property of Israel. Trump went on to recognize the illegal Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights in Syria, a legacy of the 1967 war, again spurning international consensus and indicating that the US would recognize any land grab which Israel was able to pull off. This is, of course, what you get with an administration like Trump’s, which was filled with pro-Zionist financiers like Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt. The 2020 Abraham Accords, negotiated by Trump, was another slap in the face to the Palestinian cause. Through the Accords, the countries of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, and later Morocco and Sudan, agreed to recognize Israel’s full sovereignty and normalize relations in exchange for essentially dropping the issue of Palestinian statehood. In addition to further isolating Palestine by removing even more of its Arab allies, the Accords followed the same depressing pattern which has defined Israel-Palestine diplomacy since the passage of UN Resolution 242. Once again, relations between Israel and the Arab world were treated as nothing more than a national security issue between individual, already-recognized states, eschewing any recognition or even acknowledgement of the Palestinians themselves.Trump’s first term was defined by cozying up to Israel’s most far-right government in the country’s history and rebuffing decades of international precedent to grant Netanyahu whatever he wanted, invariably at the expense of the Palestinian cause. While the Biden-Harris position on Israel is certainly bleak, we must not be deluded into believing that Donald Trump would offer the Palestinians anything like a better solution. Furthermore, unlike Trump, Harris now has a significant constituency of deeply passionate pro-Palestine voters to whom she will have to answer as president, a powerful source of political pressure that could lead to real outcomes. Trump has no such group to whom he must answer, and, with the little hope we may still have for progress in Palestine, it would be a shame to squander it on a man who wouldn’t even acknowledge the Palestinian question.As Duke students and Americans alike prepare to head to the polls, Gaza remains a key issue for many, myself included. I deeply sympathize with the frustrations of millions of Americans who are rightly outraged at what they see occurring in Gaza everyday. But we should not make the mistake of thinking that Trump will rectify Biden’s blunders in Palestine. A second Trump presidency will only lead to worse outcomes for the cause we care so deeply about, and we should remember that as we cast our votes for the next president of the United States.Leo Goldberg is a Trinity first-year."
Stress blows,Paul Dilly,2024-10-23T12:00:00Z,Oct,23,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102324-dilly-stress-blows-20241023.html,"Stress blowsI stole that from the back of a t-shirt. Boy, is that t-shirt speaking the truth. You could be doing the most fun thing ever — dancing like nobody’s watching, eating chicken ‘n’ waffles (from anywhere but Skillet), watching your favorite movie for the tenth time — and yet stress somehow worms its way in and soils the moment. I lived this.After years of enduring that, I thought I’d found the cure for the Ultimate Fun-Killer: peace. It took a crap ton of pain for me to realize that. And a crap ton more to discover it for myself. (Check out my first piece if you want those deets. I know I keep plugging my articles — I’m sorry. I don’t mean to.) But somehow all those crap tons haven’t been enough. Because my stress is still there.Before I start something — whether it be going to a class, knocking out a horribly long problem set, or writing this article — I pray. Or meditate. Or both. It helps me to let go of all the distractions, expectations, obligations, fears (I could go on) and instead live in the right here and right now. (Some call this “being present.” I couldn’t bring myself to say that. Just like I can’t bring myself to say “mental health” anymore. Feels clinical… Bleh.) You might be thinking, “That’s great and all, but what if it doesn’t work?” To which I would telepathically respond, “It does.” Well, most of the time. It should. I have all the tools: peace, clarity, flow, the right mindset, you name it. Yet there are times when stress still gets the best of me. Like yesterday.I was studying for an exam later that day when I realized I was late to another class. Unfazed, I packed my things and hurried along. I knew I was going to have to play catch-up the entire class, but I wasn’t worried. After all, I had the tools — I could figure it out. Then I got to class. As soon as I sat down — I swear I’m not being dramatic — I was hit with a tidal wave of stress. My throat burned. My hands shook. An invisible hand squeezed my lungs shut. Weird, right? Want to know what’s even weirder? My peace hadn’t left me. My mind was so settled I bet it was smoking a cigar and eating extra-buttery popcorn while it laughed at my body going off-the-walls crazy. I wasn’t stressed; I only felt stressed. It was purely physical. So I thought it was organic, a knee-jerk reaction to something I couldn’t control. I was revising a paper last night when the feeling came back. I tried to ignore it, telling myself I’d prayed and that was enough, but it got worse. Worse than it had before. I couldn’t work, couldn’t think, couldn’t breathe. I was terrified. I didn’t know what to do. I thought I was doing everything right, yet it was going all wrong. I convinced myself I needed to pray harder, longer. So I did.It didn’t work. Neither did deep breaths. I gave up and returned to my dorm. Too stuffy. I grabbed a chocolate bar — something I hadn’t done in awhile (eating healthy sucks) — and made my way to the soccer stadium. I sat in the stands and watched the sprinklers. Eventually I calmed down. I bet the chocolate helped.Then I got to thinking. What am I missing? I had peace — my state of mind reflected that. I had what I needed to conquer whatever the day threw at me. I should be impervious to stress. So why wasn’t I?Over the years, I’ve learned to associate certain things with stress. Like getting to class late. Or having three meetings back to back. Or even getting dinner with friends on a weekday. Why? Because, at the time, I couldn’t handle them. They were too much for me and my pea-sized piece of peace. I was so obsessed with all the work in front of me that I couldn’t split my mind any further. It would’ve made my head burst.Before going into one of these situations, I’ll anticipate the stress I’m getting myself into — and consequently stress about the coming stress. (I like to call this stress squared — the name distracts me from how much it sucks.) Armed with peace, my mind can now make it through these situations unscathed by stress and stress squared. I can adapt and take them in stride. Better yet, I have the capacity to relax and have a little fun, even when I have a lot to do (screw you, Ultimate Fun-Killer).However, this stress “awareness” has become so ingrained in me that I still automatically fear these situations. My body doesn’t know I have the peace to handle the situation now; all it knows is that fear signals danger. So my ever-dutiful body readies the stress-response missiles and, when the anticipated situation comes, fires away, pumping adrenaline fast and furious through my veins. Cue the tidal wave.It wasn’t my body that was the issue. Nor was it my fear. It was what I did with the fear — how I responded to it — that wrecked me. My peace told me I was strong enough to adapt to arriving late to class, and I believed it. But pockets of me were filled with doubts — the stress awareness was kicking in — and I felt the need to quell their worry with assurances: “No, this time will be different. I got this.” But the doubts weren’t satisfied with my response; they kept coming. So I kept reassuring. And they kept coming. On and on and on in a never-ending churn: It was turtles all the way down. The doubts couldn’t touch my peace. But they could still wear me down. In trying to dispel these thoughts, I gave them validation. I confirmed to them that I did fear what they were telling me. And they preyed on that — that was the fuel they needed to keep coming back. They stoked the fear and tension within me. And my body just couldn’t keep up. Ironic. I attempted to control my thoughts and, in doing so, let them control me. But I was fighting an unwinnable war: I can’t possibly control my thoughts. None of us can. Our thoughts, doubts, assumptions, biases, preconceived notions, fears — they are the product of the life we’ve each lived. We can’t just pretend that our life — and all the experiences that are bundled up within it — didn’t happen. Our past will influence our interpretation of the present, guaranteed. I’ve had a lot of stressful back-to-back meetings, a lot of stressful dinners with friends — it’s only natural I assume they’re going to be stressful again the next time.We are stuck with all those pesky doubts and biases. So we shouldn’t even waste our time trying to get rid of them. Which gives us only one option…Live as if your thoughts are annoying salespeople working one of those fragrance mall stands. You know they’re there, but you don’t look at them. Because as soon as you do, they’ll be emboldened to start pitching their cotton-candy cologne to you. And you know once they get started they won’t take no for an answer. Our thoughts are just as incessant. As soon as we respond to them, as soon as we try to control them, they know they’ve got us hooked — and they won’t let us go. Rather, let them roll around in your head. Don’t ignore them — understand and accept that they’re there — but don’t give them anything more than that. Don’t resist them. Don’t try too hard to convince yourself they are unfounded or outdated or otherwise inapplicable. Let them be. In other words, control not the thoughts themselves but how you respond to those thoughts. By choosing not to respond, you strip the thoughts of their power — you are no longer wasting any of your energy on them, and thus they have nothing to feed on. In this way, you’ll stop getting stuck in proving yourself to your own thoughts; you’ll be free to take whatever the situation gives you, to stop worrying and start living. If I simply acknowledged my predisposition to believe that coming to class late could be stressful, I wouldn’t have felt the need to convince myself otherwise. As a result, I would have avoided the tidal wave and been better able to focus on my professor’s lecture (and maybe catch up on the material I missed, too!).There will always be a thought to contend with, but that doesn’t matter: They can’t hurt you. They can’t disturb your peace of mind. You are stronger than them now. You always were. When you come to understand that for yourself, you just may forget how much stress blows.Paul Dilly is a Trinity junior."
How time escapes us,Anna Garziera,2024-10-22T12:00:00Z,Oct,22,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102224-garziera-time-escapes-us-20241022.html,"If you’re reading this article and it’s still Tuesday, you have around 74 hours left until the end of your working week. At least, what I’d call the end of a reasonable working week. On Fridays, hot girls don’t work past 7 p.m. If that seems like a lot of hours, don’t worry. They’ll go in a breeze. They’ll slip from your grasp before you even start trying to catch them.I remember well what Monday morning felt like in high school: the start of a long race. It wasn’t a hard race — I never had to work very hard. But it was dull. Dragging myself to the finish line was my weekly battle.As soon as I sat down for my 8:00 am AP Calculus class, the infinite jog round and round the track began. Time moved like a slug: the clock was always still. I went to the bathroom and walked up and down the hall. I washed my hands again. When I got back to the classroom, only four minutes had passed.The next class — AP US Government — was much the same. At the start of the period, we always took a one-page quiz on what we’d learned so far. I couldn’t tell one question from the other. Hadn’t we already done this one? I looked outside and it was pouring. The droplets moved down the window pane, but even they were slow.It was finally lunchtime. I spent most of the forty minutes in the pizza line. When I got mine, it was cold. Probably for the better. I’d have to inhale it. Class started in five. Only twenty minutes had passed since the end of lunch. The sun didn’t move outside. The air didn’t move inside. I couldn’t wait to get out of there. When I finally did, a long bus ride awaited me. After that, a long walk home. Long, everything long. ""Long day?"" asked Mom. Yes. You could say that. I did homework. I went to bed. I woke up. It was only Tuesday.College is the opposite. Time flies. I arrived on campus as a naive freshman what feels like a couple of weeks ago. I’m now midway through the fall semester of my sophomore year, and I don’t know how I got here.Some say that time goes by faster when one is busy. Others claim that the less information our brain has to process, the more time ""skips forward."" I don’t know that either is a satisfactory explanation. Whether I have one class or five, my day is inevitably very quickly over. Perhaps it’s the constant expectation of upcoming deadlines that makes time fly. I don’t measure my time in hours anymore, but in TA help sessions I have left before my problem set is due. And there’s only a precious few of those.But it’s not just the weeks that fly. Take, as an example, a Perkins study session with your three best friends. The world has never known a time warp so powerful as that library. In my experience, productivity plummets to an all-time low. And boy, does the time go by. In a three-hour session, you will likely manage to capture no more than thirty-five minutes of real work. And that’s only if your coffee order is just right and you remembered to bring your favorite highlighter.It’s inevitable: Distractions occur every five seconds. Someone coughs in a far corner. A group of visitors walks in. A student starts talking with her mom on the phone — she’s whispering, trying to be respectful, but you can still hear every word. Another one of your friends walks in. You get up to print a document, stretch your legs, and suddenly it’s dinner time. Oh, well. Tomorrow will be better.Some argue that it’s better that time flies in college. Especially at a school like Duke, college can be an overwhelming experience. With so much on our plates, the best we can do to preserve our sanity is to sprint towards winter break. But I’d expect most students don’t really agree with that. I think that as much as we feel ourselves struggling, we’re enjoying this challenge called ""college"" immensely. We don’t want our time here to end.In fact, to me the explanation of why time flies in college seems clear. They say time flies when you’re having fun. So maybe we’re having more fun that we give ourselves credit for.Even as miserable as long solo study sessions may seem, there’s a part of us that indulges in that kind of misery. We love looking at ourselves from the outside: back hunched, hood on, eye bags dark as charcoal. Celsius in hand, we’re barely awake. We give ""college student"" from all angles and sides. Ultimately, we’re chasing the feeling of having accomplished something difficult. We savor the painful journey by expecting a worthy destination. Not only that, we secretly love getting lost in the deep end of a project. There’s no better feeling than coming back to real-time, blinking twice and realizing that it’s three hours later. You missed dinner and it’s dark outside. But the project is done.And when conditions are any small amount less miserable than that — for instance, when we’re with friends — forget it. We can only try to suppress our giggles in the library.I’m only three-eighths of the way through my college education myself, so what do I really know about how we perceive time? All I can say is that in contrast with high school, I keep zoning out during this race. I keep finding myself three or four laps ahead of where I expected myself to be. College life can be delicious. But the time we have as Duke students is precious little — and we’re eating away at it too greedily. It’s true. Time is escaping us Duke students faster than we even realize. As fast-growing adults, we should try to slow this experience down. We should pull our eyes away from the next break, the finish line, and focus on what’s around us. There are a few ways of doing this. Some warn us against social media. Others suggest spending time in nature. Others still advocate doing something creative. One simple thing that has helped me slow my days down has been seeking meaningful interactions with those around me. Whether it’s a friend I haven’t run into since orientation, a current professor or a complete stranger, sharing a moment with another person infallibly brightens my day. It grounds me.There’s one connecting thread between all of this advice: We should try to create memories.Importantly, the same practices that slow time down make life meaningful. By spending time in nature, tapping into our creative side or connecting with those around us, we might be able to slow time down. But we’ll also feel more fulfilled by each day and garner a sense of purpose.Without grounding ourselves from time to time, we’ll soon find ourselves wondering where the years went. And it doesn’t matter how much we achieved on paper. At the end of the day, we won’t count our lives in internships we landed, but in memories we made.Whichever means we might try, it's not an easy shift. We need to make a conscious effort to be in the present moment and force time to slow down. Ironically, as busy college students, we don’t have a lot of time to think about that.But it’s important. Our clock is ticking. Our time here will be over before we know it.Anna Garziera is a Trinity sophomore. Her pieces typically run on alternate Tuesdays."
"Why your vote matters … despite, you know, everything",Asher D. Hildebrand,2024-10-22T12:00:00Z,Oct,22,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102224-hildebrand-why-your-vote-matters-20241022.html,"""Why should I vote?""When all the campaign ads have been aired and op-eds have been published, when all the debates have been held and viral videos have been shared, this is the one question left unanswered for many young Americans.Why should I vote when it feels like it won’t make a difference? Why should I vote when the candidates don’t represent my views or my values or my identities? Why should I vote when there are so many other things I could be doing with my time?Too often, people like me — parents, professors, oldsters — answer this question with platitudes. ""Because the future is in the hands of your generation!"" ""Because young people need to make their voices heard!""There is truth to these platitudes, of course. In this nation and in every nation, each generation eventually inherits the task of forming ""a more perfect union"" from the generations that came before.Yet for older Americans to hold younger ones responsible for fixing the problems they failed to fix, or to scold them for being skeptical about voting, isn’t just unfair — it’s also unlikely to move anybody to action. If I were inheriting the hot mess facing our nation today — widening wealth inequality, a mental health crisis fueled by unregulated social media, a terrifying epidemic of gun violence, an existential climate crisis and a political system that seems incapable of meeting these challenges — I’d be skeptical, too.So it is with great respect for the lived experience of young Americans that I’ll offer a different answer to the question with which this column began. In fact, I’ll offer five of them — and while they may sound like platitudes, I promise I’ll bring the receipts. Why should you vote? 1. Because voting has never been easier. Those of us who study and teach about democracy often focus on the many barriers that make it harder for Americans to vote. This focus is understandable: voting rights have been a defining fault line of political conflict in the United States ever since the constitutional framers made the fateful decision not to establish an affirmative right to vote, instead leaving each state to determine the ""times, places, and manner"" of elections. This conflict is alive and well today, as Americans contend with partisan efforts to make it harder to vote such as North Carolina’s new voter ID requirement.Yet for most people in most places, voting has never been easier than it is today. Between 2000 and 2024, the number of states offering early or mail-in voting nearly doubled, from 24 states representing 40% of the voting-age population to 47 states representing 97%. And for all the well-founded concern over new restrictions adopted by some states since the 2020 Election, there have been even more laws enacted by state legislatures to expand or improve voting access, according to the Voting Rights Lab.In North Carolina, eligible voters can cast their ballots in one of three easy ways (see information at the bottom of this page). Yes, presenting a voter ID has introduced an additional step that will impact some North Carolinians more than others, and there is ample reason to oppose this policy on principle. But the most principled thing we can do right now is to demonstrate that voter ID will not keep us from turning out. Duke students can use multiple forms of ID (including their physical DukeCards) to satisfy the new requirement, and those who don’t have an ID can pick one up quickly and easily between now and Election Day.2. Because your vote could decide this electionI hear often from young voters that they feel like their vote won’t matter — either because they believe it won’t impact the outcome of the election or because they believe the outcome of the election won’t impact their lives.I share the frustration many feel with America’s rigid two-party system, and I strongly support reforms to bring a more diverse range of parties, candidates, and voters into our elections. But while the choice produced by the two-party system is limited, it is still a choice–and in this election, the choice could not be starker. On virtually every issue — from climate action to reproductive rights to U.S. policy toward Israel and the Palestinians — the policies the two leading presidential candidates would pursue would put our nation, and the world, on two drastically different paths.And in many elections — including this one — the outcome could come down to a handful of votes per precinct in key states. In 2020, former President Donald Trump won North Carolina by only 1.34 percentage points — an average of fewer than 28 votes per precinct. The 2024 Election is shaping up to be even closer, with Trump leading Vice President Kamala Harris by less than a percentage point in most polling averages. North Carolina could truly swing either way — and young voters could make the difference.Of course, not voting — or voting for a longshot third party — is also a choice, and for some it may be a principled one. I won’t debate the principle here, but as a matter of math, it is a choice that makes it more likely the candidate you support the least will win. In fact, many analysts believe the 2024 election will be decided not by committed voters who are still making up their minds about how to vote, but by Americans who are still making up their minds about whether to vote at all.3. Because voting gives you a seat at the tableYou’ve probably heard it said that ""if you don’t vote, you don’t have a right to complain."" I disagree: you always have a right to complain. But there is solid evidence that if you don’t vote, your complaints are more likely to fall on deaf ears. How responsive policymakers are to the preferences of their constituents is a perennial debate in political science, but recent studies have found that changes in constituent preferences lead to changes in legislators’ policy positions, that elected officials are more responsive to their constituency when they’re up for reelection, and that legislators are more responsive to voters than to the population at large.These studies are consistent with my personal experience working in a congressional office for nearly 15 years. We tried our best to represent the views and interests of all constituents, and we never once asked whether or for whom they had voted. But there is no question we were most highly attuned to those who were most highly engaged in the political process — as advocates, as activists, and, yes, as voters. We didn’t always do what they asked, but we were more likely to listen to them in the first place.4. Because (most of) your peers are doing itYes, young Americans vote at lower rates than older generations. There are many reasons for this — and many reasons I hope it is changing.The last three elections give us hope that it is. In the 2020 presidential election, turnout among 18-29 year-olds surpassed 50% nationwide — an 11-point increase over 2016 — and reached 55% in North Carolina. Youth turnout doubled between the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections, though it fell off modestly in 2022. Overall, more young people are voting today than at any time in recent memory. And with 41 million members of Gen Z eligible to vote in 2024, this is the first presidential election in which their vote could be truly decisive.In fact, Gen Z is doing more than voting: its members are running for office at the state or local level and increasingly in Congress too. You don’t have to look too far for inspiring (and perhaps rivalry-provoking?) examples of this: a few years ago, a UNC senior won a seat on the Chapel Hill Town Council by 24 votes! 5. Because voting is the ultimate (civic) gateway drugFinally, you should vote not instead of the many other ways you could choose to participate in our democracy, but because voting also makes you more likely to participate in other ways.A strong body of evidence shows that Americans who vote in one election are more likely to vote in future elections, and that voting is correlated positively with other forms of civic participation such as donating to candidates, contacting elected officials, or joining protests and demonstrations. These diverse forms of participation enrich our lives and strengthen the fabric of our communities–but the people most likely to undertake them are not representative of society as a whole. By opening a gateway to broader civic participation for Americans who have been marginalized from power, voting is an essential means of reducing political inequality and moving our nation closer to a truly representative democracy.For all these reasons and more, your vote matters…despite, you know, everything. Early voting has already begun. What are you waiting for?Asher D. Hildebrand is a Professor of the Practice in the Sanford School of Public Policy.

The column typically runs on Tuesdays or Thursdays.Voters in North Carolina can vote in one of three easy ways:By mail. Voters may request an absentee ballot until October 29 and return it by mail or in person to their county board of elections by 5:00 p.m. on Election Day (Tuesday, November 5).In person during early voting. Voters can vote in-person during the early voting period (October 17 to November 2) at any early voting site in their county–including the Karsh Alumni and Visitors Center on Duke’s campus. Even if you didn’t register to vote before the October 11 deadline, you can still register and vote on the same day during early voting!In person on Election Day. Voters who registered to vote by October 11 can vote in-person on Election Day (Tuesday, November 5, from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.) in their home precinct, which will be at a different location than the early voting site (look up your Election Day voting site here)."
Fall break: Forever elite,Ashlei Tomlinson,2024-10-22T12:00:00Z,Oct,22,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102224-tomlinson-fall-break-elite-20241022.html,"By now, everyone has come back from Fall Break. Some, however, didn’t even have to leave their dorms to be back for the start of classes on Wednesday. And so together, they watch those who flew or drove hours to leave campus on Friday return after another hours-long trip, fresh-faced and revived from the first of the midterm season. To them, it would seem that traveling so far and for so long for a three-day sojourn was worth it. That spending ample money on an, in some cases, $800 plane ticket was a mere sacrifice for the respite of returning home. Unfortunately, not everyone has that luxury. Fall Break, a holiday usually spanning 3-4 days, figures more as an extended weekend. It’s certainly not a holiday meant for travel or, at least, not one conducive to travel for those who dwell in the lower tax brackets. So how do those who cannot afford to fly or drive back and forth from campus frequently rationalize splurging on a ticket home for fall break, given that Thanksgiving and winter break are not too far behind? That’s it, they don’t. Instead, they are sequestered on campus in a desert of wealth. This, however, is not the financial reprieve it would appear to be. For those staying on campus have to spend their — likely already scarce — food points to eat, an act that, though not overtly inimical, actively disadvantages students who will now have fewer food points than those who left campus and are arguably in a better financial position to spend. Coming back to campus then, not only are those who left campus arguably more sated than those who stayed on, but they are also better situated to enjoy their time back on campus, thanks to their spare food points. Ironic, isn’t it? Whichever way one might choose to enjoy fall break, they are left with a cost. It’s as if fall break panders to the elite and affluent, disregarding the financial concerns and mobility of the less endowed. Perhaps that’s why, when compared to their public counterparts, private universities disproportionately celebrate fall break. Private, unlike public, universities have the financial autonomy to leverage their schedules, allowing for more holidays, like fall break, in the semester. Public schools, however, must abide by state regulations lest they risk losing funding for the next academic school year. It is beyond unfortunate that some public students who perhaps most need a break cannot afford one, especially considering that a higher proportion of public — not private — students tend to work while attending classes. Fall break is, therefore, inclusive in that it excludes all unrich. That is, whether the unrich attend private or public school, Fall Break will threaten their financial and mental well-being. Those who can celebrate Fall Break to its fullest — namely, driving and flying hours to and from campus — may want to consider then whether it’s fair that one class of students gets to decompress while another does not. They may want to consider whether what they enjoy and, in effect, is elitist. Ashlei Tomlinson is a Trinity first-year."
A vote is a prayer,Luke A. Powery,2024-10-21T12:00:00Z,Oct,21,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102124-powery-vote-is-prayer-20241021.html,"Political ads are everywhere, so I want to do one, too. However, this advertisement won’t be for a particular party or candidate. When I say, “political,” I am referring to the root meaning of the word. Embedded in the word “political” is the word polis, which is the historical term referring to an ancient Greek city-state. Polis is the broader society in which we live. In this sense, we are all part of the polis, and so we are all engaged in the “political.”As a Baptist minister, an important guidepost for me for political engagement is the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “Letter from a Birmingham Jail.” In it, he articulates the tension within Christian circles of that day about engagement with societal issues. He writes, “In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard many ministers say: ‘Those are social issues with which the gospel has no real concerns.’ And I have watched many churches commit themselves to a completely other-worldly religion which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinction between body and soul, between the sacred and the secular.” What King and others teach about, and model, is the intersection of the spiritual and political realms. The spiritual is political and the political is spiritual. Again, this isn’t about political partisanship. It is about engaging in society in meaningful ways, rather than attempting to escape or ignore it.As early voting has started for the November elections, it is important to remember those in the past, due to race or gender or other descriptors, who were not allowed to vote in this country. This means that voting is a privilege and shouldn’t be taken lightly. Your vote is your voice on a ballot. Duke Men’s Basketball coach Jon Scheyer says that in voting you “use your voice to shape the future that you want.” In addition to being your metaphorical voice on a ballot, a vote is also a spiritual act. The word “vote” comes from the Latin votum, which means vow or wish or desire. It is something you want or hope for. Within religious settings, votive candles are short, thick candles that people light as part of a prayer offering for a particular person or situation. (There is a votive candle station in the side chapel within Duke Chapel.) In the Catholic Church, a votive Mass is a Mass offered for a special intention. A vote, therefore, is a votive act, a wish or desire. It is essentially a prayer. Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, who is pastor of the “King family church” Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, has said, “A vote is a kind of prayer for the world we desire for ourselves and our children.”If you track social media, it may seem as if this political season is anything but holy; even so, I encourage you to vote as an act of prayer and a gesture of hope for the future. Voting with this spiritual perspective in mind will remind us that it is a sacred moment, one in which polls can become altars for your votive prayer offered for the welfare of our fellow citizens.

"Duke to open a third campus, Duke Las Vegas, after record-breaking fall break attendance ",Monday Monday,2024-10-21T12:00:00Z,Oct,21,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102124-monday-monday-duke-las-vegas-20241021.html,"After it was reported that more Duke students went on their fall break trip to Las Vegas than their attendance-based classes, the Duke administration plans to begin a new campus expansion project. Despite its #6 US News ranking, Duke aims to improve class accessibility with this new location, hoping to produce more successful alumni since there are still dozens of unnamed campus rooms and buildings. They were initially hesitant about expanding the Duke campus footprint after spending so much money to celebrate its centennial (thank you so much for Ed Sheeran, Daddy Duke). In addition, offering the same programs at the Kunshan or Durham campuses seemed redundant. So, instead, the administration decided to start with a fresh approach and a brand-new campus. The school deans are excited to develop a new curriculum to better prepare undergrads for the real world. Duke students loathe ""flipped classrooms,"" where the professors make the students learn the material at home (which, of course, everyone does) and then discuss it in class. It’s generally seen as the biggest waste of tuition ever, and I’d gladly confront its creator on behalf of all undergrads. That’s neither here nor there, but Duke Las Vegas’s economics flipped classroom is sure to become everyone’s top class. In the Vegas flipped classroom, each student is given $10,000 at the start of the semester and has to gamble during each class. The students with money at the end of the term get an A and keep all winnings. Luckily for the students, top economics majors volunteered to lead the flipped classroom, with the stipulation that they get to keep 10% of the purse. There is a group of Duke students who are sure to thrive in this new class — those who make up Duke’s underground sports betting ring. Unsurprisingly, 80% of this betting ring is made up of economics majors and all of the frat brothers on campus. The other 20% of the sports gamblers are a cohort of students known as the ""WU Crew."" These students post up daily in the eating hall, Western Union (WU), and take notes of any athletes on crutches or in casts before placing their bets. This will be a hands-on course that, if done successfully, can pay off a few semesters of tuition in only one class! The waiting list is predicted to be longer than the already successful History of Hip-Hop class with 9th Wonder. And, apparently, the seasoned sports gamblers on the Durham campus are in on the Vegas plans. They’re super hot. And really funny. And never break the Duke Community Standard. Full disclosure: They bribed me with a better waitlist spot for this hype, so I don’t know if any of that is true.Additionally, the Duke Global Education Office is almost as happy about the move as the sports gamblers, as Vegas simplifies study abroad programs. Duke will now be able to open a Duke in Egypt program inside the Luxor Sphinx and a Duke in Paris semester program in the bottom tier of the Eiffel Tower on the Las Vegas Strip. Duke administration is even toying with having housing for the study abroad students in Caesars Palace to provide a multi-country immersion experience.The new campus promises to boost Duke Arts. With a residency slot opening in the Las Vegas Sphere, the administration plans to host an a cappella sing-off for the coveted inaugural spot. Additionally, Duke Arts wants to partner with the Durham campus’s tour guides to show students famous movie locations. Must-see stops include The Mirage for an ""Ocean’s Eleven"" heist photo op and the Mandalay Bay Street parking lot, where some random Duke alum jumped naked out of a car in ""The Hangover."" Sadly, the wedding chapel in ""The Hangover"" was part of a movie set, but the administration predicts that it not being real won’t deter Duke students from transferring to Vegas. Despite being called ""Sin City,"" there is a predicted spike in undergrads moving west because the hundreds of chapels make it easier to get a ""ring by spring.""Duke plans to officially announce the new Vegas campus next week, but they’re letting me test the waters first. If the public thinks it’s a joke, Duke will deny everything, but I’ll know the truth. Monday Monday would like to remind readers that while DraftKings’ ""bet $5, get $200 instantly"" deal is tempting, don’t bet your tuition. Also, the Duke Las Vegas campus’s tuition will be quadruple the amount of the Durham campus’s tuition to account for any potential casino winnings that might help students graduate debt-free."
Vote! (And wash your hands),Herman Pontzer,2024-10-17T12:00:00Z,Oct,17,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101724-pontzer-vote-and-wash-hands-20241017.html,"If you grew up in the U.S. like I did, you can be forgiven for thinking democracy is part of the natural order. Voting starts early and lurks everywhere, from picking a name for the class goldfish to choosing our favorite TV show contestant. Puzzling, then, how democracies around the world, from Turkey to Venezuela, and yes even here, seem to be struggling. The truth is that democracy is inherently vulnerable, and it’s vulnerable because it’s unnatural. You need to work to preserve it, with your vote and your voice.As a researcher at the intersection of human evolution and public health, I see it all the time. We’re a hunting and gathering species in a Ben and Jerry’s world, our technological and cultural progress carrying unintended consequences. It’s an old problem. The advent of farming some 10,000 years ago brought more food and larger families, but average height dropped, brought low by increased population density and infectious disease.The population growth that followed farming affected our politics as well. Hunting and gathering camps typically number between five and thirty adults, enabling face-to-face discussion and public deliberation, and important community decisions are reached through consensus. Those strategies don’t easily scale up to meet the needs of hundreds or thousands of people. As foraging gave way to farming and populations grew, consensus became untenable as a political system. Instead, authority was held by those with power, either physical or economic. Over the past 10,000 years, the vast majority of people lived under some form of dictatorship. Billions still do today.In a handful of societies, like the Athenians and the Iroquois, people hit upon a different solution, one that took power away from dictators and recaptured the community-centered decision making of forager consensus building. Democracy gave power back to the people and encouraged public discussion. Majority rule isn’t quite the same as consensus, but it offers something similar: group decisions favored by the people and a political system that isn’t rigged to benefit the powerful few. Like soap, public sanitation and the other tools that finally turned the tide against infectious disease, democracy provided a powerful antidote to authoritarianism.Democracy, like germ theory, is still a young idea. The United States was an early adopter in what became a global revolution, the growth of democracy around the world paralleling our own country’s long march toward full inclusion and representation. In 1788, when our Constitution was ratified, democracy was rare among nations and voting in the U.S. was available only to white men who owned land. By 1965, when the Voting Rights Act was passed to ensure all men and women could vote, roughly half of all countries around the world had some form of elected government. As democracy grew globally, more and more people were empowered to fight for labor laws, race and gender equity, LGBTQ rights, public education, social safety nets and other public investments that made life better for everyone, not just the elites.But just like public health and hygiene, democracy needs to be learned and practiced anew by each generation. It doesn’t come naturally. Polarizing campaigns, personal attacks, filling out a ballot alone — none of it feels like the community-focused consensus building we’re built for. Representative democracies, like ours in the U.S., often lack the immediate connection to group decisions found in direct democracy. And like public health, successful democracy is boring and imperfect. The changes we want are slow in coming, and we take the victories of yesterday for granted. Like washing your hands, finishing your antibiotic, or getting vaccinated, it’s easy to think your individual actions don’t matter. Yet it’s never been more important to do our part to preserve and promote democracy. Since 2016, the number of people worldwide living in a democracy has fallen by 1.6 billion. In the U.S., an antidemocratic movement has worked to amplify our natural ambivalence to modern politics, casting doubt on our elections, gerrymandering districts to disempower voters and placing hurdles between you and your ballot. Like the ever-evolving viruses and bacteria that never truly go away, the dictators of old have mutated, adapting to the modern electoral ecosystem to hold onto power. To keep the dictators at bay, we need to adapt as well. The dual crises of 2020 — COVID-19 and the assault on our election — were vivid reminders of how fragile the foundations of our society can be. It’s up to each of us to lend our effort and energy to the essential project of democracy. Let’s lean into our instincts, talking with our friends and neighbors to motivate our communities. We can put the most modern of innovations, social media, to work on the ancient art of consensus building. Check with your friends, virtual and IRL, to make sure everyone is registered and ready to get to the polls.Most of all, each of us needs to vote. We can’t let the obstacles and excuses rob us of our voice. For all that has changed since the Paleolithic, the fundamentals of group decision-making have remained the same. Whether we build consensus around the warm glow of a campfire or an iPhone, when each of us participates, we win. Herman Pontzer is a Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology and Global Health.

Why do we care so much about the legacy ban?,Katherine Ramirez,2024-10-16T12:00:00Z,Oct,16,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101624-ramirez-legacy-ban-20241016.html,"On Sept. 30, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed AB 1780, a new bill banning legacy and donor-based admissions for private colleges. This happened in reaction to last year’s Supreme Court ruling banning affirmative action, with groups such as Class Actions claiming legacy admissions disproportionately benefit white and wealthy students. California is not the first state to do this; Maryland earlier this year made a similar move banning legacy and donor admissions in private colleges. In a statement, Newsom stated, ""In California, everyone should be able to get ahead through merit, skill, and hard work … is why we’re opening the door to higher education wide enough for everyone, fairly."" But how effective is banning legacy admissions in achieving that goal of fairness?This article is not meant as a jab towards legacy students or to imply that they are undeserving of their spots. Legacy without major donations remains a boost to an application, but applicants are still expected to meet academic standards. But this boost is still given to a group of students who are generally advantaged beyond their legacy status.The most common defense of legacy admissions is tied to the idea that it encourages donations that will help all students. Families might be more likely to make large investments in a school — such as a new library or engineering building — if they’ve attended that school for generations. And this conversation often focuses on financial aid, claiming that students from lower-income backgrounds benefit from the legacy structure since donations partially fund their aid packages. But is it really believable that a top 6 university, as many Duke students have touted on their Instagram pages, would struggle to find funding without legacy admissions? Other institutions such as Johns Hopkins University and Amherst College have opted to end their practice of legacy admissions, and both institutions still retain endowments valuing billions of dollars. Moreover, Richard Kahlenberg’s ""Affirmative Action for the Rich"" found that evidence of legacy admissions increasing donations was marginal to non-existent. So if peer schools manage to raise money without legacy and this practice lacks evidence, why does Duke continue practicing legacy admissions?There’s no good reason for Duke to continue its practice of legacy admissions, but it is also unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Without other efforts, there is no guarantee that freed-up legacy spots would go to disadvantaged students in the first place. Around half of Duke is on financial aid, but that means around half the student body has the family income to pay full price around $90,000 a year.When it comes to aiding historically disadvantaged college students, the discussion often centers on elite colleges. But the so-called Ivy-Plus serves less than 1% of college students, and these numbers are even less for Black, Hispanic and Native American students. In the Duke Class of 2028, these groups represent around 28% of the freshman class yet represent around 42% of Generation Z.The discussion often centers on this ideal kid from a low-income household who ""beats the odds"" and excels in high school. But why do we only care about a needle in a haystack? Even a brilliant kid might struggle to achieve at a high level if they have an unstable household, a bad school environment and economic instability. On top of that, the average person deserves opportunity and not just those identified to have nebulous potential early in life. Helping disadvantaged students involves funding the colleges in your neighborhood, expanding gateway programs in high school while students are still required to attend and creating more equitable education at all levels. Duke and similar schools providing opportunities for historically disadvantaged students should be further encouraged, but they can’t meaningfully change inequalities in education on their own.I stand by the fact that Duke should remove legacy admissions on the principle of fairness and its lack of tangible benefits, though I am under no delusion that admissions would become entirely fair if this policy were removed. I don’t believe there are any admissions policies Duke could enact to be entirely meritocratic, since at the end of the day, high achievement doesn’t exist in a vacuum. But the discussion surrounding equality in education ought to not surround elite colleges, because they can never be a solution for most students. The colleges most crucial to economic mobility are not elite colleges, but the local schools that most college students will attend. Community colleges and satellite schools serve most college students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, so the discussion must begin there.Katherine Ramirez is a Trinity first-year."
The things we can’t electrify,Aaron Siegle,2024-10-15T12:00:00Z,Oct,15,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101524-siegle-20241015.html,"Ever since Michael Faraday’s discovery of electromagnetic fields in 1831, electric power has been heralded as the ultimate human achievement. Now, as humanity is beginning to recognize the importance of tackling climate change, electrification is touted as the best path forward.It is widely agreed that the converting more energy uses to electricity is our best shot at tackling climate change. However, the ""electrify everything"" approach overlooks two major challenges. First, many activities, such as aviation and heavy industry, cannot be feasibly electrified. This is because electricity does not have a high enough energy density to fuel these extremely energy-intense activities. Second, the grid needed to supply electricity is massively inefficient and struggling to keep up with rising demand. In other words, we need to make better use of the electricity that we already have before we switch over more end uses toward electricity. By integrating electrification with broader energy-efficiency efforts and tailoring decarbonization for a diversity of scenarios, only then can we achieve our climate goals.The benefits of electricity are manifold. Because voltages can be stepped down (which transitions more of the energy to current as opposed to voltage, making the electricity safer), power can come into our homes at safe levels. Electricity can be generated at one location and consumed hundreds of miles away, interconnecting large regions. From a decarbonization perspective, almost all carbon-free sources, ranging from solar to nuclear, run on electricity.The ""electrify everything"" strategy is twofold. First, devices that previously ran on fossil fuels are replaced with those that run on electricity. This means replacing internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with electric vehicles, gas stoves with electric stoves and gas furnaces with electric heat pumps. Second, the generating sources of the electricity must be clean. Coal and natural gas plants must be retired in favor of solar, wind and nuclear. If these two goals can be accomplished, then our entire economy can run on electric devices powered by clean electrons — or so the thinking goes. However, going all in on electricity has its own drawbacks. The American electric grid was largely built over a half-century ago and is starting to show signs of its age. Furthermore, this old infrastructure is struggling to keep up with skyrocketing power demand largely driven by the growth of data centers to power AI. Having all systems run on electricity creates the risk of single-point failures. If the power goes out, then society shuts down. Finally, not all sources of emissions can simply be switched over to electricity. Agriculture, aviation and heavy industry — sectors comprising roughly 20% of America’s emissions, do not have viable electric alternatives.That’s why we need to take a whole system approach when reducing emissions. Rather than switching in an electric replacement for our current technology, we should use the energy transition as an opportunity to reassess our relationship with technology as a whole. For example, take electric vehicles, a key component of the ""electrify everything"" strategy. Instead of just replacing ICE vehicles with electric vehicles, decarbonization should entail designing more walkable cities to reduce car dependency. And investing in intercity rail to provide alternatives to flying or driving for long-haul trips. Our current economy is stuck on a path of dependency on fossil fuels. When building the green economy, we must be mindful of the unintentional path dependencies we are creating.A core component of this is making the grid more efficient. Currently, renewable energy developers are waiting an average of five years to connect their projects to the grid due to limited transmission capacity. However, transmission lines can actually carry much more electricity than they are currently allowed due to inflexible regulations that fail to consider dynamic environmental conditions. Think about it like setting the speed limit on the interstate to 20 mph for the entire year because that is the safest speed to drive on a snowy winter day. Furthermore, transmission technology such as improved conductors can further maximize the efficiency of the infrastructure we already have in place. So, what can be done to decarbonize the things that we can’t electrify? First, we can work to drive down unnecessary uses of power. Much energy is wasted on unproductive activities or in circumstances where consumers don’t fully understand the environmental footprint of their actions, notably when using crypto and AI. Cryptocurrency mining should switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, a shift that would result in a 99% emissions reduction without impacting crypto trading. Also, consumers should avoid wasteful uses of AI. An average ChatGPT query uses 2.9 Watt-hours (Wh) of electricity, 10 times the amount of a Google search. Goofy image generation and using ChatGPT as a calculator is killing our planet.Second, energy efficiency needs to be a central tenet of the electrify everything strategy. Instituting dynamic line ratings and reconductoring existing transmission lines will make existing energy sources go further. Promoting demand response programs and encouraging distributed energy generation will limit the amount of electricity wasted.Third, more investment is needed in difficult to electrify sectors. Creating carbon neutral alternatives to cement and steel is a capital-intensive endeavor that will take patience. The same goes for sustainable aviation fuels. While these new technologies mature, simple fixes, such as planting cover crops in agriculture, are important first steps to cracking difficult to decarbonize sectors.Though electricity is a powerful tool, it is not a silver bullet. Communities and industries need to take a wholistic view of sustainability that goes beyond a carbon-emissions balance sheet. Before we can electrify everything, we must be realistic about what we can’t electrify.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity junior. His pieces typically run on alternate Fridays."
Our desire to be loved can be deadly,Susan Chemmanoor,2024-10-14T12:00:00Z,Oct,14,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101424-chemmanoor-desire-loved-deadly-20241014.html,"""If I gave up on being pretty I wouldn’t know how to be alive.""This lyric from Mitski’s Brand New City has haunted me since the day I heard it. It felt like a punch in the gut. Or maybe a slap awake. The song tells the story of a young woman who feels stuck in her ways, tired of reinventing herself to please the people around her. Contorting into reflections of other people has become her habit. Her true identity has been done away with. While I could harp on the pitfalls of chasing an impossible standard of beauty, I believe the song’s core theme is tied to a larger truth: the desire to be loved is both universal and deadly.The desire to be loved is a core ingredient of being human. We yearn to be accepted, to be together, for there to be an ""us."" So, as we find our way in the world, we slowly do away with the traits that don’t please the people around us. Sometimes, this is necessary. It’s self-growth or perhaps even evolution. But more often, it’s self-erosion. It’s the erasure of core traits, a misled rejection of quirks that made a person so wonderfully singular. We project these new, less interesting versions of ourselves into the world to seek approval. We feign nonchalance, we buy the same bag as that girl on the bus, and we slowly let ourselves disappear. But to contort into a depthless version of you is to deny yourself the fullness of your own humanity. It is to put your life’s purpose in the hands of strangers, to let them be the arbiters of your identity. Mitski’s words made me realize I often live for other people. My day is too often driven by making sure people like me. While of course, people make life worth living, allowing your enjoyment to be dictated by others’ opinions is a path destined for resentment and exhaustion.Chasing shallow acceptance will never truly satiate. Real acceptance comes from surrender. A sort of agreement of vulnerability between two people. It can take many forms. Maybe it’s a friend bringing you soup when you’re sick. Maybe it’s your mom listening to you vent over Facetime. Maybe it’s sitting in silence together because it was a rough day and you just want some company. It could be a knowing smile in a coffee shop. It could be a squeeze of a hand when things get bad. It’s these awkward attempts of connection that we’re truly hungry for. For someone to look at us, see our flaws, and still say ""yes."" For to be loved is to be known. In our ugly entirety.We are messy creatures rife with imperfection. There is no use in pretending otherwise. So, it is time to lean into the risk of being you. Whether that means getting that haircut you’ve been too scared to get or wearing that outfit you’ve been saving in the back of your closet. Maybe it’ll be uncomfortable. Maybe people will treat you differently. But maybe you will truly live. Finally on your own terms. Susan Chemmanoor is a Trinity sophomore. "
Community members share remembrances for Joel Fleishman,Remembrances,2024-10-11T12:00:00Z,Oct,11,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101124-remembrances-to-joel-fleishman-20241011.html,"I was privileged to be a student in the very first class that Joel Fleishman taught at Duke in the spring semester of 1972. If he approved of a point in an essay, he wrote a plus sign (+) by it. If the point was better, it got two plus signs (++). The best points received three plus signs (+++).To this day, I use the same grading system in my work as a lawyer, when I am reading law to find a precedent case that helps my client and merits three plusses.Terry Sanford brought his friend, Joel Fleishman, to Duke. Fleishman carried on the spirit of Terry Sanford at Duke over the decades since we lost Sanford.David Erdman, Pratt '71~~~~~Only rarely does one have the blessing of a friend whose life evokes awe, inspiration, purpose, connection and just plain fun. Joel Fleishman, who died at 90 was all of these. From Duke University to Atlantic Philanthropies, from politics to wine to classical music to being on the board of Ralph Lauren, Joel sparkled with ideas and experiences that most of us can only aspire to from afar.To say that Joel was a mentor puts me in a pool of perhaps hundreds for whom he played the same role. We were introduced by Alan Khazei and within 20 minutes of our first conversation in his New York office, Joel said ""you must come to Duke and guest teach one of my classes."" And so I did every year for the next 20 years, followed always by a dinner party in his home with students, faculty and the most interesting people on North Carolina, including political or philanthropic leaders who might be passing through. There were a few stories about the work of Share Our Strength that he loved and made me repeat to every class whether they fit my lecture subject or not — and I just could not deprive him of the delight he seemed to take in hearing them yet again.During the few semesters I was not able to teach, I would come to Duke anyway to have dinner with him or take walks, or just hang out. One summer I flew down to the beach house where he was staying at Kill Devil Hills on the Outer Banks, and we walked miles during the day, drank great wines and called friends of his late into the night.Joel was truly an American original, with one of the most youthful minds I’d ever known. And he used it to write books, teach, speak and to relentlessly connect people he thought should know one another. He fought hard for his 90 years — particular, if not quirky, about what he ate, when he exercised, and how much he slept, determinedly adapting to cane or walker or wheelchair as time eventually took its toll, adapting but not surrendering as he was not by finished, not by a longshot. Joel especially fought hard for young people — for the ideas they had, and the new organizations and campaigns they wanted to launch.There was a reliable rhythm of ritual that came with having Joel in one’s life, and that may be what I will miss the most: his singing Happy Birthday to my voicemail every February, the annual holiday prayer and card on which he labored, sometimes for months, which arrived every December, his class each spring. On top of everything else, his humility and humor simply made him the loveliest person to be around. I will miss him daily and dearly.Billy Shore, founder and executive chair of Share Our Strength~~~~~Joel Fleishman knew everyone. I’m convinced of it.I learned this incontrovertible fact the first time I walked into Joel’s office at the Sanford Institute. It was early 1997, and I was beginning a month-long fellowship sponsored by my then-employer, The Washington Post. I knew beforehand that Joel was an expert on philanthropy — even that description woefully undersells what was his true acumen for the subject — and I wanted to get his permission to sit in on his Friday afternoon seminar about the nonprofit and charitable world.As I introduced myself to Joel, I could not help but notice — and no one who ever entered his office could have avoided doing so unless they were blind — the several crammed Rolodexes that took up a prominent position in his workspace. My mouth agape, I told him who I was. Within seconds, we had established that he seemed to know everyone I knew, from close members of my family to a host of folks in journalism to others. He essentially confirmed right then and there the authenticity of the Rolodexes.Over the following few weeks, Joel and I became solid acquaintances and then friends. One weekend, he invited me to what can only be described as one of his famous people-broker parties at his nicely nestled home in the woods of Chapel Hill. He introduced me to all manner of people, from an undergraduate student to a senior faculty member, nearly always able to relate a connection between the two of us. His mind was like those of the legendary London taxi drivers who, in pre-GPS days, carried in their well-wired brain circuitry the ability to identify the quickest route between any two points in the city (“The Knowledge”). Joel connected everyone and was entirely ecumenical about it — he really seemed to want everyone to know everyone else.I will miss that connectivity, as well as all of his other wonderful expertise, from philanthropy to the law to enology.I was privileged to know him, even though, in my mind, everybody already knew him anyway.May his memory be a blessing.Kent Allen, '97 Washington Post Fellow at Duke~~~~~A quick story about Joel Fleishman and my family: My mother and Professor Fleishman were classmates at Fayetteville High School in the 1940s. During my time as an undergraduate at Duke (1981-1985) she would ask me periodically if I had met “Joel Fleshman” (as she said everyone had pronounced his name), who she said had been the most brilliant boy at her high school. I benefited from his pioneering work at Duke by majoring in Public Policy Studies. I ended up winning the Fleishman Award, which the man himself graciously presented to me at Commencement with my parents present. He then met my mother again for the first time in more than forty years. It was a lovely and fitting end to my years at Duke.

Eruditio et religio,Arya Krishnan,2024-10-11T12:00:00Z,Oct,11,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101124-krishnan-eruditio-et-religio-20241011.html,"I always felt a disconnect from the roots of my native country, India. Attending an international school and consuming Western pop culture my entire life, I was oblivious to the cultural heritage of the land I lived in. Now, attending a college continents apart, I felt a lingering emptiness. Whether it was the distant call of my ancestors, a longing for exploration or just homesickness, I knew I needed to reconnect. So I took a gap year to do exactly that. During that time, I immersed myself in practicing yoga and meditation, studying ancient Hindu scriptures and embarking on pilgrimages to sacred temples. I was entranced by this new world and way of life. When I returned to college, I wanted to deepen this exploration in an academic context, so I enrolled in a history course on Indian Civilizations.During the course, we studied an excerpt from the Rig Veda — the most ancient and foundational scripture of the Vedic tradition, which would eventually evolve into Hinduism. Back home, in my own self-study, I had revered the text as utterly sacred. To me, it was a divine revelation — unquestionable and incomparable, the literal ""word of God."" However, in class, my beliefs were brutally challenged. The scriptures were presented as mythology — symbolic stories reflecting sociopolitical realities. To me, though, they were more than just stories; they were historical records of divine encounters, and this academic approach undermined that sacredness.The ancient scripture was no longer a living, breathing literary manifestation of divinity. It became raw evidence, subject to clinical scrutinizing and dissection, like exhibits in a museum. In an attempt to understand the historical and social context of the text, we stripped the Rig Veda of its spirituality.At first, I found this troubling and controversial. Not only were my own personal beliefs and values confronted, but so were those of an entire religious community. In certain orthodox circles, the intellectualization of these texts may be considered blasphemous. Though I didn’t hold as stringent views, I certainly felt that a huge amount of value of the scripture was lost due to two key factors: environment and approach. In India, for example, the reading or discussion of scripture is always preceded by and concluded with invocations, prayers and hymns. This builds a certain atmosphere conducive to spiritual contemplation and divine communion which a classroom lacks. In a religious or spiritual environment, one may approach scripture with a sense of devotion and reverence, which shapes the way one reads and interprets it. When the text is treated as evidence, one may draw interesting information about a historical people and their culture, but one often loses the essence of the text. Emotional connection, deep symbolism and underlying esoteric wisdom, which I believe are the crux of most scripture, are often neglected in an academic environment. Despite the apprehension, I resolved to go into class with an open mind. I put aside personal biases and preconceived ideas and went into the readings and lectures with a passion to learn. I felt compelled to do this, as embracing new perspectives and ways of thinking was, for me, a core part of the college experience and the reason I chose to attend Duke. I saw it as my duty as a college student to expand my limited understandings and challenge my own ideas and beliefs. In class, we explored the linguistic, archaeological and genomic research that provides insights into the people of the Rig Veda. We discovered striking linguistic connections between Sanskrit, the ancient language of the text, and other classical languages like Old Persian and Ancient Greek, and compared their mythologies. We also examined 5,000-year-old burial sites across Central Asia and Europe and analyzed ancient DNA evidence. Together, these studies wove a narrative, a story of migration: people moving across lands; interacting with others; developing languages, cultures and traditions, and building vibrant communities and civilizations.For the first time in my life, I felt a deep reverence and connection to my own lineage and ancestry. Only now, in a Georgian-style classroom building in North Carolina, did I get a deep and broad insight into the culture and tradition of my homeland.As part of my spiritual practice, I perform a daily puja — a ritual worship of my favorite deity. Initially, I found the practice a bit obscure and quirky, but through what I learned in class, I gained a deeper appreciation for it. I realized that this form of worship belongs to an ancient tradition spanning millennia and continents. The next time I performed my puja, I no longer felt isolated. Instead, I felt connected to a greater whole — a timeless human narrative of devotion and reverence that transcends individuals, cultures, and eras. Although I still believe that the nuances and deeply personal aspects of a religion cannot be fully grasped in an academic context, I realized that the power of research and scholarship offers insights far beyond what one could learn through personal practice alone.It didn’t matter whether others considered my scriptures to be mythology. I realized that I could still hold my personal beliefs while gaining valuable knowledge from the new perspectives I encountered in class. These perspectives ultimately strengthened my faith by providing deeper layers of meaning and context.One evening, after finishing choir practice at the Duke Chapel, I noticed statues of two women. After inquiring, I was told they are the personifications of Eruditio (knowledge) and Religio (religion), from Duke’s Latin motto ""Eruditio et Religio."" This university was built not just for knowledge, nor for religion, but for the pursuit of knowledge AND religion. My experience in class showed me that knowledge and religion don’t necessarily clash and can instead serve to enrich one another. To fully grasp the wonders of life, both are essential.

Searching for resonance in a sea of contention: A coming out piece,Nik Narain,2024-10-11T12:00:00Z,Oct,11,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101124-narain-a-coming-out-piece-20241011.html,"Modern journalism tells us that we live in a post-truth world, a world where facts are less influential to arguments and the lines between subjectivity and objectivity become increasingly blurred. ""Post-truth"" was the Oxford Word of the Year in 2016, and it’s unsurprisingly making its reemergence with this year’s upcoming election. A post-truth world leads to a greater distrust in government and scientific authority and a stronger reliance on emotion in shaping one’s beliefs. I’m not saying this is an entirely negative thing; it rightfully holds authorities accountable and underscores the fundamentally malleable nature of human knowledge. However, in a world of ever-growing misinformation, fake news, fear-mongering and hate speech, this notion of the ""real truth,"" then, becomes a more complex battle of science, rhetoric, media and resonance.In physics, resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when a system is able to oscillate with greater amplitude at a particular frequency, known as the system's natural frequency. When an object experiences an external force equal to that natural frequency, it exhibits resonance, where it vibrates at that high amplitude. Resonance is the phenomenon that underlies everything from musical instruments to playground swings, and in its emotional sense, resonance forms the basis for human connection, catharsis and chaos.Now, this is not an article about physics or the state of American politics, but about gender. As many might know, questioning gender is one of the most confusing processes you can ever go through, regardless of whether you’re cis or trans. It makes you re-examine every memory, behavior, thought and interaction through equal lenses of curiosity and frustration. It compels you to question what even is gender at all — something defined as both a feeling and a social construct, a biological (in)congruence and an entrenched system. It forces you to be the subject and the researcher in this exhausting experiment around a question that only you ultimately know the answer to. On the one hand, I want to believe that I’m in the 93% of people for whom transition improves overall wellbeing. But on the other hand, perhaps I was a victim of so-called “Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria” (ROGD), which, although now thoroughly debunked, was a dominating argument for the so-called ""rise"" in trans people recorded. I want to believe that gender is not and never has been binary and the overwhelming historical evidence documenting the stories of trans/GNC communities around the world. But the majority of history books, bathrooms, sporting events and prominent internet personalities promote the contrary. I want to believe the politicians who promise to enforce anti-discriminatory protections, but I inevitably end up hearing from those who wish to mock LGBTQ+ people instead.I want to trust these institutions so badly. I want to take the words they say as the ""real truth."" But, like overlapping waves, it feels like all these rushes of contradictory information effectively cancel each other out, leaving only this feeling of emptiness and fear (there’s a name for this phenomenon in physics, called ""destructive interference,"" which seems apt).But then I get this funny feeling when I wear button-downs. When I cut my hair. When I use a different name or pronouns. When I’ve used it for long enough I sometimes forget, just for a second, about who I was before because living as this person feels good, feels right, feels natural. Heck, when I open jars or doors, or when the barista at Bella Union calls me ""buddy"" when I order coffee. That feeling multiplies ten-fold when I see other trans people sharing and even celebrating similar experiences (even if it is on Reddit at 2am). And in this raging white noise of contention, I suddenly feel amplified, intensified, excited for a future where I originally saw…static. And, despite the questionable validity of this acoustic metaphor, I guess resonance was all I ever really needed.But you liked princess movies when you were a kid. But you never liked sports. But you never talked about this before with anyone — surely if you were really trans, you would’ve known years ago? Wouldn’t it have been obvious?I wish I could view transness out of politicization, but as trans existence itself becomes increasingly politicized, we have to be evermore mindful that political narratives not only shape how people see us, but how we view ourselves, and consequently how we treat ourselves. Even though the existence of trans people and everything that goes with it is not really a debate, the detriment of a post-truth society means that no matter how much evidence we accrue about the effectiveness of gender-affirming healthcare or trans well-being, we will be compromised by other people’s fear of change and what they cannot understand.I’ve often lost sight of the fact that in the absence of any concrete answers to the question of my metaphysical ""true gender,"" I’ve gained something much more valuable: community. People who resonate with my experience at such a fundamental level, and believe in it, even when I often look at myself in disbelief. And that’s something I hope I never lose nor take for granted. I feel like my collegiate life has been measured in these cycles of self-beration, self-liberation, self-deliberation and back again, a recognizable oscillation that has served as the drumbeat for my own semblance of self-transformation as a young adult (emphasis on the trans). I’ve spent so long trying to rationalize my reasons for shifting place in a system that is, at its core, irrational, one whose rigidity and unnecessary reinforcement has been the cause of suffering, violence and death for too many people around the world. I don’t want to say that this is my ""most authentic self"" or that ""this will solve all my problems,"" but it is something that makes those problems feel like they’re worth solving.Perhaps, this brief article can spark a feeling of resonance in someone else. Perhaps, years from now, I’ll find another experience that is more resonant to me. For now, I’ll continue to ride this wave and see where it takes me.Happy Coming Out Day everyone :)Nik Narain is a Trinity senior. His pieces typically run on alternating Saturdays."
Twelve easy steps to prepare for the coming dictatorship,"Vanessa Woods, Brian Hare",2024-10-10T12:00:00Z,Oct,10,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101024-hare-woods-twelve-steps-dictatorship-20241010.html,"Having spent years in African, European and Asian countries ruled by dictators, we never used to appreciate the stress our friends experienced before their Presidential elections. Typically, we avoided these periods, but occasionally our visits overlapped with election season. Whether in person, or listening to our friends’ experiences, we have learned some lessons that some might feel are unusually helpful in this moment.Many people of different political persuasion, believe we are, or will soon be, living under dictatorship here in the United States. Earlier this year, political commentator George Will decried in the Washington Post, “Joe Biden is, like Trump, an authoritarian recidivist mostly stymied by courts.” Last November, in the same newspaper, political scientist Robert Kagan published an op-ed titled, ""a Trump dictatorship is increasingly inevitable"" and argued, ""the odds of the United States falling into dictatorship have grown considerable because so many of the obstacles to it have been cleared."" And this was before the Supreme Court’s July decision that the U.S. president has criminal immunity for all “official acts.” Many are afraid that the table is set for the first American emperor to ascend the throne.Malarky, you say! We live in the world’s oldest republic — the cradle of liberal democracy. Our president is known as the leader of the free world. Only the most unhinged have ever worried about a king in America. You know, like John Adams, our second President, who responded to accusations of his own authoritarian streak with, ""there never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.""All these serious people, past and present, are obviously not serious. After all, we might be scared enough to act, if we believed the U.S. could fall into dictatorship. But just to humor all this annoying pessimism, we provide twelve easy steps to help you prepare for the transition to dictatorship.Stop worrying about fake news. With dictatorship comes the death of the free press. Things will be simpler with only one propaganda channel to choose from.Clear spaces on your walls at home and work (and preferably in your car and in your wallet). With dictatorship comes tests of loyalty. The most basic signal is to display the picture of your new dictator prominently. This way, the new regime knows you are aware you are always being watched and thinking of the dear leader.Get rid of your bullhorn and poster board. With dictatorship comes the end of government sanctioned opposition protests. You will not need to worry about your freedom to assemble or with whom to register your peaceful protest.Don’t get too close to your professors or protesting friends. With dictatorship comes the harassment and disappearances of opposition leaders. There will be no speedy trials but plenty of time for long, hard labor. Get a lawn chair.With new dictators comes looting. You might think a weapon will help you, but as our friends say, “eventually, a gun runs out of bullets. It’s safer to welcome looters with open arms and wait in comfort as they take all your belongings.”Get a wheelbarrow. With dictatorship comes inflation. If the post-pandemic seven percent inflation jump in the U.S. just rocked your world — imagine one-hundred or one-hundred-thousand percent inflation that occurs in autocratic states. Our friends strongly recommend a wheelbarrow for carrying stacks of money when shopping. Stay close to your family but stop worrying about saving money. With dictatorship comes economic stagnation and unemployment. Any money you might make will have to be shared among struggling family members.Stop upgrading your tech. With dictatorship comes massive corruption. Infrastructure, like roads, electricity, and the internet, will be crippled as funds are siphoned away to build palaces and playgrounds for regime members.Get to know your local police or join the military. With dictatorship comes a flood of injustice. To save your friends or family from jail or even worse you will need to know how to bribe corrupt officials — the odds are even better if you are one.Forget everyone being equal. With dictators comes the most extreme forms of inequality. Embrace notions that different groups are superior or inferior — make sure to identify with the majority group that will think they are superior and more human than other out of power groups.Don’t worry about voting. With dictators come single party sham elections. Voting can no longer change any policies or who is in power. Cancel your appointments downtown for weeks before and after these “elections”. Any opposition will be greeted with violence.Flee the country. With dictators comes hopelessness and flight of talent. Join other super talented citizens of your country and find a home with more democratic norms so you don’t need step 1-11 to survive (Sweden, Finland and Norway currently top the list of most democratic countries). Follow these twelve easy steps and you too can live your life in a constant state of mild panic. Or you can vote, encourage others to vote or help folks get to the voting booth so they can vote.Brian Hare is a Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology.

Rethink following your dream,Jasmine Fan,2024-10-10T12:00:00Z,Oct,10,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101024-fan-rethink-dream-20241010.html,"I grew up a huge WWE fan, especially of women’s wrestling. As a kid, I scoured the internet for WWE matches. I practiced pull-ups on a bar that hung in my bedroom doorway. I would even force my sister to let me attempt different choke holds on her. I was a little girl with a big dream: Someday, I would become a WWE Superstar.One night, I proudly announced to my parents that I was going to ""follow my dream."" They nodded and smiled — that is, until I revealed my plan to drop out of middle school, audition for WWE, and become a pro wrestler. My mom was absolutely horrified. My dad, on the other hand, took the more rational approach. He sat me down and explained that if I wanted to become a WWE wrestler, I would have to be in the top 1%, maybe even 0.1%, of wrestlers to even have a chance at supporting myself. On the other hand, if I graduated college with a CS degree, for example, I wouldn’t have to be the best programmer to land a stable job. Though my dad’s reasoning seemed logical, I felt he didn’t have enough faith in me. Why couldn’t I be the one who defied probability? Why couldn’t I be the 1%? As I grew older, however, I began to examine my childhood dream more critically. What if my dad was right? Reflecting back on this experience has forced me to challenge the framework of following your dream. There are a few hesitations I have with this belief.First, the success stories of a few can be misleading. In my case, I was only aware of the WWE wrestlers who made it on TV. But what about the 99% who tried and failed, the wrestlers who never made it onto my radar at all? I had fallen into the trap of survivorship bias, noticing only the glittering success stories and ignoring the rest. My perception of the American dream was an echo chamber of success stories, built upon the minority who were able to beat the odds.Success stories are also subject to hindsight bias. It’s much easier for the Mark Zuckerbergs and Steve Jobs of the world to encourage others to drop out of college and follow their dream. They’ve already made it. But would they have the confidence to proclaim it before they became successful? What about if all their entrepreneurial efforts had failed? Probably not.I’m not saying we should allow probabilities to dictate our lives. We shouldn’t. At the very least, however, we must recognize how these biases distort our perceptions of reality. Another concern I have with following your dream is that it’s a uniquely American privilege absent from many other countries without certain liberties. In fact, even in the U.S, it doesn’t exist for everyone. Because of familial obligations, health reasons or other extenuating circumstances, many don’t have a safety net to fall back on. As a result, when passion clashes with practicality, they are forced to prioritize the latter. Chasing your dream is a luxury not everyone can afford.But that’s not even the worst of it. Following your dream actually closes more doors than it opens. I had become so fixated on my wrestling dream that I shut down a myriad of other career paths. Yes, I wanted to become a WWE Superstar, but it was more so that I wanted to feel strong, empower others, challenge myself mentally and physically, and perhaps let out some of my inner twelve-year-old rage. Those were my true underlying aspirations. There are countless avenues to pursue these aspirations. If I wanted to challenge myself mentally and physically, I could’ve expanded my dream to include various other sports and pursued them as hobbies instead of full-blown professions. If your aspiration is to help others, for example, becoming a doctor is certainly not the only path. You could become a teacher, coach, mentor, volunteer … (the list goes on). In my mind, the power of a dream lies in its potential to open more possibilities. Why dream linearly when life is precisely the opposite?Before following our dreams, we must first reframe them to align with our inherent aspirations. Dreams should define who we want to be, not what we want to be. I dream of becoming a leader, an advocate and a better person. I hope to help others around me. I aspire to become more like the people I love. These are the kinds of dreams unaffected by biases, accessible to all and expansive in possibilities. These embody the person I strive to become.I know you’re out there probably busy chasing your dream, and I’ll let you get back to it. But before you carry on, take a moment to pause and reflect on your current dreams. Do they open more possibilities? Do they align with your aspirations? Do they truly represent who you want to be?Jasmine Fan is a Trinity sophomore."
Masters of none,Anna Garziera,2024-10-09T12:00:00Z,Oct,9,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/100924-garziera-masters-of-none-20241009.html,"""What do you want to be when you grow up?""Adults first asked us this when we were still in elementary school. They expected the same old answers, which is exactly what we gave them. An astronaut. A princess. Back then, the possibilities were endless. The sky the limit. ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" They asked us again in middle school. Our answers were hardly better than before. A firefighter. An actor. A football player. We gave them glorious careers.College applications asked us once more during our senior year of high school: ""What do you want to be when you grow up?""This took us by surprise. Isn’t college all about figuring that out? We didn’t really know what to say, then. We gave what we thought were likely answers. A dentist. A nurse. Maybe a lawyer. Whether these were our answers or our parents' answers is hard to tell. Now, as college students, we’re more realistic among ourselves. And more direct. ""So you’ll probably become a consultant?"" Yes. Probably a consultant. Duke churns out hundreds of consultants every year. It seems that generations of students before us have made the same easy decision. Specialize in financial economics. Get a consulting job in a mid-size firm. Tread the well-marked path. Sophomore spring is a pinnacle moment in every Duke student’s career. The Class of 2027 will soon have to declare its major.We’ll either decide to stick with the major and implied career we’ve been contemplating since early high school, or indulge in our inevitable undergraduate identity crisis. Maybe, what we really want is to study psychology. Statistically speaking, many of us will change our minds. And again.That’s because our interests are infinitely unique, complex and unstable. Shaped by both our natural predisposition and experiences, our tastes can’t be summarized by an eight-question career test we took in high school. Our hopes for the future can’t be captured by a single profession.""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" Gulp.Add to that the pressure from family and peers to embark on a respectable professional career and we’re stripped of the little confidence we had. It looks like we must undergo the effort of graduate school or fail to uphold our parents' expectations. I don’t remember signing up for this.Maybe it won’t be so bad. Maybe we'll still like learning new things in a couple of years.After all, the summer left us craving to learn anything and everything. When the shopping cart opened for fall registration, we felt like kids in a candy store. With so many options, how could we possibly choose? But the work that the fall semester brought with it changed our minds — it gave us learning indigestion. We’ve already had enough. But this mid-semester burnout doesn’t only have to do with overwhelming workloads. It’s also the fact that our classes are almost the same as they were last semester and so similar to each other in the first place. There then seems to be a discrepancy between what students want to do — cherry-pick unique classes that seem interesting — and what Duke asks them to do — choose a major and run with it. The ironic thing is, we’d be better off doing the former.Theoretically, Duke students get to choose 24 classes outside of their major requirements. Already, this isn’t a great deal. Out of four years of classes, about one-third of them will be major-specific. And within many majors’ requirements, there’s little to no wiggle room. Emphasis on specific. But most Duke students aren’t content with only one major. When having to fulfill two to three different sets of degree requirements, it’s no saying that there’s little space for students to ""explore.""Willingly or not, Duke is helping narrow students’ interests too early on in their academic journeys. Duke students are automatically subscribed to their major’s weekly newsletter as soon as they declare. We are invited to events related to our major’s prospective careers. We are encouraged to network with professors from our major’s department. We are told to start building our resumes early. As a result, we take interest only in our respective majors. We don’t distinguish ourselves.And it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more we specialize in a subject, the more we become proficient in it, the more we become interested in it. Even our family becomes convinced that we were ""born to be a doctor."" But it could have gone a different way. And the worst thing is, we’re sold this scheme as our being encouraged to ""explore our interests."" But our academic curiosity was killed long ago with that career survey. Now we need to be reminded that learning ""something about everything"" outside our majors is just as important. That was the original purpose of the university as the old philosophers had imagined it: education as a single endeavor. Not separating the topic from the field of study. Not separating the mechanism from its application nor theory from practice. And that’s not all: Only having reached a certain mastery in the basic subjects — philosophy, mathematics, logic and medicine — were students allowed to break off and specialize in a singular field. Plato would not be too happy with our mass-produced institutions. They put students too early on non-intersecting tracks to specific destinations. They release too many ignorant consultants.When industrialization swept across the United States in the early 1800s, cheap, disposable labor was replaced by even cheaper machines. Jobs were knocked over like dominoes. And now some wonder if artificial intelligence will do the same in this century.What measures can we take as soon-to-be contributors to the workforce to protect ourselves from such an untamable and unpredictable beast? Perhaps, the answer is the same as it’s always been. The oldest law of Nature: diversification. An ecosystem’s health can be estimated by a single metric: its biodiversity. The more complex the ecosystem structure, the faster it will likely recover from a disturbance. The more genetically varied the species, the more likely it is to survive a new disease. Economists know this too. That’s why they say to diversify your portfolio. Yet economics majors fail to diversify their wealth of knowledge and skills beyond what is strictly required by their majors. Perhaps, we just don’t have the time. Sure, we might be mildly interested in astrology. But in this economy, the only way to keep afloat is to pick an easy A to fulfill the science requirement and use that class time to catch up on other courses. Reading up on constellations is all fun and games — but I have to finish my Econ homework first.Unfortunately, this lack of interest in classes outside their majors impacts these students’ grades in all classes. That doesn’t seem right. How could knowing the basics of astrology possibly help me better understand supply and demand? But subjects, at their core, are all deeply interconnected. Skills are shared across subjects. If you have to learn French vocab, you'll also learn its Latin root. You’ll have to know basic algebra to ace a physics or game-theory exam. And whether you’re majoring in biology or computer science, you’ll have to know how to speak to a group and put together a compelling PowerPoint. I was thinking all this as I was helping my friend do his chemistry homework recently using only some basics of calculus and geology. I learned about specific heat capacity, while he learned how to rework units to derive a formula. Importantly, we both took home something valuable.This is interesting because sometimes we limit ourselves to putting time into opportunities that are linked to our major. Importantly, time spent on a class we’re not even taking might feel wasted. But it’s not wasted at all. Having a basic grip of a variety of skills and a basic understanding of all subjects has high returns at the undergraduate level. But that’s not all. Knowing how the world works from different angles makes us better world leaders. Successful communicators bank on the fact that the best way to explain something is with an analogy. By encouraging students to specialize in specific fields early on in their education, colleges across the board are making students less unique. And by segregating education paths, they are limiting not only students’ career possibilities, but also their success in life. We should be doing all the opposite. As students, we need a well-rounded education to become flexible workers and successful communicators. We first need to be jacks of all trades if we want to become masters of one. And if our interests don’t only fall in one specific field, which they likely don’t, all the better. We shouldn’t try to suppress our wilder dreams.One can never approach the same problem from too many angles. Solutions can and should be shared across disciplines. A broader background will help us build intuition of how the world works. But we knew this from the start. That’s what our elementary school teachers called ""thinking outside the box.""

What are they doing over there? American politics from a European perspective,Jakob Hagedorn,2024-10-08T12:00:00Z,Oct,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/100824-hagedorn-american-politics-european-perspective-20241008.html,"My grandmother first visited the U.S. as a young German girl in 1964 as a Girl Scout camp leader, and she still tells me about it every time I mention that I'm a visiting international student at Duke. It was one of the greatest adventures of her life, and the U.S. symbolized everything she aspired to be and to have. They had defeated the Nazis and liberated Germany, and just four years after the end of the war, they were supplying the capital (and my hometown) with the Berlin Airlift during the Berlin Blockade.As I prepared for my time at Duke, I realized how much that perception of the U.S. — and my expectations — had changed since my grandmother’s visit. Instead of the strong optimism she experienced, I felt somewhere between very excited and genuinely anxious. The America I was about to encounter seemed more divided, more uncertain. The Trump administration and its many changes and cancellations of multilateral treaties weakened trust in the U.S. as a reliable partner, and ultimately the January 6th attacks showed the world how very vulnerable one of the world's oldest democracies is. So when I came here, one of my goals was to understand what had changed and what was so different about the U.S. political system compared to the change in Germany. I was surprised at how deeply the two-party system affects political discourse in a more polarized America. Aside from being the obvious point of criticism with its many obvious flaws, many have pointed out before, such as the possibility of winning the popular vote but not the election (most recently in 2000 and 2016), I would argue that it impacts everyday discussions.Coming to Duke, I was struck by how often American voters seemed uninterested in discussing the election, even though it was less than two months away. I learned that if you are not politically active, it is simply not that important to discuss specific political issues because most voters always vote for one party and the direct impact is relatively small. Political disillusionment, i.e., the lack of trust in political institutions, goes far beyond voter turnout. It was a strong contrast to the often relaxed and daily political discussions I had in Berlin (to be fair, it is a highly educated and liberal city). You can talk about relationships, homework and the global climate crisis all at once. I would argue that because Germany has about seven major political parties, the discourse can be more policy-focused. The parties have to convince voters to vote for them, instead of just convincing them not to vote for the other party. Although Germany has very similar problems with populism and government inefficiency, the discourse is different. When we talk about discourse, we have to talk about polarization. In addition to the lack of interest I mentioned, I met people who were simply afraid of the reaction to their political opinions. If parts of the population are so polarized that they won't talk to each other, that becomes a bigger threat to democracy than actual anti-democratic candidates. Interestingly, perceived polarization, how people think about each other, is often higher than actual polarization, their actual actions and beliefs. This gives me personal hope that this process is easier to reverse than many think. It is easier to change people's opinions of others than it is to change their core beliefs and habits.Another observation I have made is that many people's main interest is in local politics, then state government, then perhaps federal government, and finally some global news. This leads in part to a lack of knowledge about basic global issues. While there is a general blind spot in the Western hemisphere on issues affecting the global South, this solely local-to-federal focus contrasts sharply with the close attention many Europeans pay to U.S. news and the political landscape. On issues like Russia's war against Ukraine, there is a geographic and geopolitical component to this difference. U.S. officials and part of the electorate see China as a greater threat to their national security than Russia, partly because U.S.-centric education and media tend to focus more on issues directly affecting American economic and security interests. This could also be seen in the most recent presidential debate. According to recent studies, Americans show great interest in these issues, and there is no better place than Duke to learn about them.To be clear, I don't want to generalize the American people as uninterested or uneducated; at Duke in particular, I've met inspiring activists and people with a very impressive knowledge of world politics. As my time here continues, I find myself in a great position to learn not only about the U.S. but also about how its political dynamics resonate across the globe. I hope to offer some valuable insights and to end with a thoughtful quote from the German philosopher Novalis, allowing others to “see the ordinary as extraordinary, the familiar as strange.”Jakob Hagedorn is a visiting international student from Berlin, Germany.

"Puppy kindergarten to shut down after puppy is kidnapped, eaten",Monday Monday,2024-10-07T12:00:00Z,Oct,7,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/100724-monday-monday-puppy-kindergarten-20241007.html,"""They're eating the dogs, they're eating the cats…"" Well, you know the rest. This anthem has been circling the internet after word spread of ACC college mascots trying to eat the puppies in Duke's Puppy Kindergarten. Duke suspects foul play from jealousy after a documentary about the Puppy Kindergarten was released on Netflix this summer. Last-minute efforts to save the pups included attempting to hire 19 bodyguards, one for each remaining puppy. I was lucky enough to be invited to see a session of 50 people, ranging from beefy to twig-like, being placed through the rigorous tryout. I was shocked that instead of testing security protocols and being assigned a dog to watch over, the University used unconventional screening methods to select their guards. The potential guards first had to practice a dramatic side roll, accompanied by action music, under the K-ville sign. Six guards didn't have dramatic enough rolls or couldn't fit under the sign, so they got the boot. Luckily, they got to chow down on some Hi-Chews, the official fruit chew of Duke Athletics, while they watched the rest of the potential guard cohort go through testing. As I took a small sip from the 6-ounce water bottle provided for the 8-hour tryouts, I saw University officials start chucking unclaimed packages from the package center at the people trying out in Cameron Indoor Stadium. Some knew to duck, but one unlucky girl got hit in the face with a box of new Peach Star Golden Goose shoes. Ouch. She covered her bloody nose and tried to run down a hall to find a bathroom but unknowingly attempted to enter the sacred hall that the basketball players ran out of. It, unfortunately, activated a laser security system, equipped with axes from all angles, that cut off some of her ponytail. She voluntarily left the tryouts, mumbling, ""My father won’t be donating anymore!""Soon after, the remaining 43 candidates entered Wallace Wade Stadium, where they got to play with the puppies before they ""pref’d"" their top dog, sorority style. Pepsi the Puppy was a fan favorite, but Poppy was a close second. After that, everyone got in line for the final two tests to prove they could protect their favorite puppy. The next task was multi-stepped: catch a pass from a ball machine, pelt it at a puppy-stealing mascot, and tackle it before it steals the puppy. Failing to catch the ball will lead to a 10-second penalty delay in running to get the mascot. A cocky, classic ""he peaked in high school"" man sauntered up to the ball, ready to protect his puppy, Sadie. Right as the man was catching the ball, Stanford's weird tree mascot made an early break, ran out of the stadium tunnel and jumped on the pup before the man could throw the ball. Slightly confused, he dropped the ball, leaped on the Tree and attempted to tear off its sewn-in leaves before officials told him he was disqualified for not first hitting the mascot with the ball. During the water break, the former head Men’s Basketball Coach demanded they care for the dogs as much as he does his own, drill sergeant-style. One of the people saluted the coach, and the others quickly followed. The coach rolled his eyes with one final ""they're hopeless"" to the officials overlooking the tryouts. Thirty more people were cut, leaving only 13 guards to protect the 19 puppies. Now, it was time for their final test: identifying restaurants in the student dining hall, Western Union, that would be safe for the puppies. Some of the guards ran around to look at the freshness of meat and produce offered, but the diamond in the rough 24-year-old, Aden, wrote down, ""They all have chocolate, so none,"" and lounged at a table near the entrance until the search was over. Everyone except Aden was cut for their lack of identification of deadly foods. However, after a University Official overheard Aden saying that he hoped more puppies would be eaten to make his job easier, he was fired on the spot. In the end, no one met the strict criteria the Puppy Kindergarten wanted for their previously unguarded puppies. The University's president was heard whispering that he was glad the Puppy Kindergarten would be out of the administration’s hands.

In the eye of the hurricane,Adam Levin,2024-10-07T12:00:00Z,Oct,7,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/100724-levin-eye-of-hurricane-20241007.html,"Nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, bordering the Pisgah National Forest, lies a small community named Celo. Defined by its Quaker values, the community collectively shares about 1,100 acres of land among 60 families. It also owns a summer camp I’ve attended for the last 10 years of my life. After attending the camp for six years as a camper, I came back for four more as a staff member. There, I helped in every conceivable way to give the campers the same experience I remembered from my camper years — I led backpacking trips, cooked home-cooked meals and emceed camper-led performances. The countless hours I’ve put into this camp have shaped me: working with kids and out in nature has a funny way of enabling you to embrace your authentic self. Years later, one moment from my years as a camper still forms my view of Celo. On a mid-camp morning, a trumpet poked through the flaps of my tent — bright brass melodies escaped from its horn. Every staff member at Camp Celo seemed to gather outside my tent, performing their once-every-three-weeks wakeup: a hopeful, heartwarming song called ""Postcards from Italy."" I still treasure that feeling, the community and the beauty permeating each moment of the song. Regardless of my deep connection to Celo and the people I’ve met there, the community feels deeply isolated. Trapped in a valley between towering peaks and 25 minutes from the nearest town, it seems like nothing can touch the peaceful, simple life of Celo. Last weekend, that isolation transformed from a defining feature of the community to another cause of its devastation. On Saturday, I began to understand the true impacts of such isolation. I hurried to the tailgate, decked out in my personalized Duke jersey and bright blue face paint. Mindlessly, I opened Instagram, swiping from story to story, my feet autonomously moving forward. Yet stumbling upon a story of my close friend’s sister, everything seemed to stop. My feet halted in their path. The pop music blasting through my AirPods paused. My excitement for the game vanished. Until I opened that story, I didn’t really understand what Hurricane Helene had meant for North Carolina — sure, we can complain about the storm drains on East or the longer bus routes, but our experience with the storm was entirely distinct from the Western half of the state. The Instagram story explained that my friend’s sister had not been able to contact her family for days, that severe flooding had occurred in her hometown, and that she was not sure who was alright or what was going on. Reckoning with a crushing fear about the safety of a friend while tailgating for a football game isn’t the easiest thing in the world. Luckily, soon after, she texted that she was okay — that she finally had access to WiFi but that every other service was still gone. I still remember her words: Celo is destroyed. Camp Celo after Hurricane Helene made landfall (courtesy of Friends of Camp Celo).And the next few days, trapped in a state of limbo — glued to the consistently horrifying news in Appalachia while living the normal ""college experience"" — made me realize that here at Duke, the world always seems to go on. The grind never stops. While the worst storm since Katrina inundated an area so far inland it was formerly seen as a ""climate refuge,"" Ed Sheeran and UNC both visited to help us celebrate our centennial. As Governor Cooper declared a state of emergency because of Hurricane Helene, the university declared that the concert would go on ‘rain or shine’. And even though images of the disaster are plastered on the front pages of the New York Times, it’s still hard for us at Duke to understand the extent of the catastrophe that occurred in Western North Carolina this past week. Eily Rule, a member of the Celo community who’s been assisting with the relief effort, explained to me that ""the media and the rest of the US is still not grasping the severity of our situation here."" When a firefighter was asked about a GoFundMe for Pensacola, an area near Celo, Rule recalled that, ""a GoFundMe link has not even been thought of yet, their focus is consumed by trying to get people out alive.""Yet even amid devastation, the community and the resilience of the same community that once played ""Postcards to Italy"" outside my tent flaps has not disappeared. The Celo community has banded together to bring each other food, water, gas and medical supplies. One local posted, ""It’s a weird combination to be utterly devastated and deep in our soul grateful. The outpour of love and support from so many from Charlotte, to Asheville, is overwhelming.""As members of the broader North Carolina community, it is our responsibility to offer the same support. If it is within your means, I implore everyone reading this article to send even a little financial support to communities in Western North Carolina. Because my greatest fear is that, in a few weeks, everything will go back to normal. The little concern that existed at Duke and outside of Western North Carolina will disappear. As the executive director of Spruce Pine, a town a few miles down the mountain from Celo, explained when Helene hit, ""Appalachia is so frequently forgotten ... We just don't have the bodies or the resources to prepare for something like this."" Don’t forget, and don’t let your concern be washed away by the daily rhythm of Duke life. Below are various resources to send contributions — in Celo and across Western North Carolina.

Time to lament,Luke A. Powery,2024-10-07T12:00:00Z,Oct,7,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/100724-powery-time-to-lament-20241007.html,"My first book, ""Spirit Speech: Lament and Celebration in Preaching,"" was an attempt to fill what I saw as a gap in the scholarly literature in the field of homiletics, which is the academic study and teaching of the practice of preaching. At the time, much of the literature on Black preaching in particular usually only highlighted ""celebration"" in preaching, where there is often a musical intoned climax near the end of the sermon in antiphony with the congregation. Celebration is historically rooted within the ""invisible institution"" of Black slave religion, through which enslaved preachers celebrated even while being devastated. Musical preaching, like the musical singing of the spirituals, was a means to resist and overcome the slave master’s oppression.In my book, I did not try to ignore celebration or mute its importance, but I wanted to acknowledge and explore another voice in preaching, the voice of lament. It has always been there in Black preaching, though it wasn’t emphasized in the literature. I wanted to lift it up on par with celebration because lament can spur us to tell the truth. Biblical scholar Walter Brueggemann says lament declares ""life is not right,"" whatever the specifics may be. Lament is honest speech and for people of faith, it is faithful speech. In the book of Psalms, there are many laments that ask questions and even get angry with God — Why? How? I take my cues from the Psalms. For the times in which we live, lament is on-time speech. If we remember all of the lives taken by international wars and natural disasters, it is time to lament. Lament for all the human hatred and injustice and lost lives, including innocent children. Lament how hatred seems to be a hero these days abroad or even at home. Lament against political power plays and backdoor deals that disregard human lives. Lament for how quickly human life can disappear by torrential rains and mudslides. Lament that ""all flesh is grass"" (Isaiah 40).Sometimes all we can do is lament. We don’t have to have all of the strategies for salvation or to have everything figured out. Sometimes all we can do is sit down on our bed and cry. Sometimes our only response is tears as our breakfast, lunch and dinner. And it’s okay because expressions of lament are human; they are nothing to be ashamed of.In fact, lament is love. Philosopher Nicholas Wolterstorff wrote a short book, ""Lament for a Son,"" when his young son tragically died in an accident. I read the book almost 30 years ago for the first time but one of his sentences still strikes my heart: ""Every lament is a love song."" Wolterstorff lamented because he loved his precious son. You lament, not because you hate, but because you love and imagine a different world. In the Bible, when Jesus discovers that his close friend Lazarus is dead, he wept at his tomb and onlookers said, “See how he loved him!” (John 11). We still love those who are no longer with us on earth and so we weep. We care so deeply that we weep for what could have been or should have been. Dare I say, if we don’t lament in the face of all of the suffering we see and experience in the world, we don’t truly know how to love.The theologian Howard Thurman in his book ""Disciplines of the Spirit"" wrote, ""Suffering stalks man, never losing the scent, and soon or late seizes upon him to wreak its devastation."" No one is immune from suffering or death. How you respond to devastation is critical. I urge you in these days to love lament because it can be how you learn to love more honestly, deeply and spiritually.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel.

'You’re so mature for your age': On the pressure to perform and missing out on a childhood,Leila Zak,2024-10-04T14:30:00Z,Oct,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/100424-zak-pressure-to-perform-20241004.html,"""I guess everyone here is kind of messed up.""At least — that was the consensus we shared at 2 a.m., on the floor, in our three-person circle at the end of the hall. We had made our ascent from a series of confessions, having divulged to one another some of the most turbulent, formative histories that had shaped us (kicking and screaming) into our present-day selves. It brought us closer together, in a sense. We could not have fully known each other until we knew this: where we came from, in all our dimensions and tragic glory.What we meant to say with this conclusion, though, was that everyone at Duke has likely come from a similar, high-pressure background. We sport an aversion to failure yet hold ourselves to impossible standards. Sacrifice is just another prerequisite to the concept of ""success"" after which we chase so furiously. Without sacrifice, we would not be at Duke. And without Duke, without the titles, credentials and group-affiliations we’ve amassed, who would we be? How else might we define ourselves? We’ve become so used to introducing ourselves with one of our titles in particular: our majors. We are pre-med, pre-law, English majors, engineering students — defined by a tentative future instead of the qualities we project definitively in the present. From an early age, many of us learned to tether our worth to our strengths and achievements, placing value not on who we were, but rather on what we could do best. Failure, as we understood it, was not an option. Before Duke, some of us may have navigated a rockier road. Validation in a school setting may have served as a substitute for the security we sought from family, friends or significant others. Theory and numbers were not nearly as volatile as life could be in the outside world.In school, there was a clear-cut rubric to success, and this calculable route toward validation could work as a source of stability amid an otherwise chaotic life. If we could not derive fulfillment from other areas, at least we knew we could achieve well in the classroom. For some, it was more comfortable, more predictable than home could oftentimes be. It is much simpler to learn about addiction, abuse, or assault in an academic setting, for instance, than it is to experience it first-hand in the flesh. Whatever the root cause, we pushed ourselves to excel often at any expense, even when it meant neglecting our health, relationships and personal passions (perhaps even for artificial ones). Whether it was driven by financial necessity or simply our own self-made monstrosity, we placed extraordinary pressure on ourselves to get to where we are today. And we were rewarded for it. We felt in control. We received affirmation and admiration alike for engaging this vicious cycle.In the media particularly, youth are celebrated for their displays of superlative talent. It is always impressive when children bear skills and mindsets that exceed the perceived confines of their years. What’s paradoxical about this, though, is that young people are so often lauded in the public eye for taking on the most pressing issues of today, but are at the same time underlooked in the professional world on the basis of their age. They are undermined in the workplace, but are expected to have the capacity to tackle global, system-spanning challenges all on their own accord.In a dim and anarchic world, youth inspire hope as ""changemakers"" and the ""leaders of tomorrow."" Instead of taking place and precedence in the present, progress is deferred to future leaders, future generations. And while many young people are invariably committed to and find value in the work they do, the real issue is, at its core, systematic. It begs the question — why should the responsibility to create lasting, collective change lie on the shoulders of students and not on those at the helm of global governance? Why are our youth working against a system that is actively working against them? There is this sense of ""if they won’t do it, I will."" Many of us are forced to mature early by the displays of iniquity we witness either around us, directed toward us, or in the media. Disillusioned by the world we inhabit, we are prompted to be agents of change, to seek out reform in any way we can. We are pressured to carry the weight of the future, but in thrusting these enormous expectations onto ourselves — similar to the case of academic pressure — we miss out on the proper childhood we could have lived. In both of these cases, we are forced into adult shoes at a premature age. And by consequence, we are denied the time and space we need to be immature, to make mistakes and learn from them, to grow, to have real, unfettered fun — to truly be children at all. All the while, the expectations both we and society demand of ourselves continue to tower ever-higher over us. And when it’s all too much, we will have two options: either continue enduring this hell we’ve created for ourselves, or topple. Either way, we are the ones who will have to bear the brunt of it.

Democracy at work ,Matthew S. Johnson,2024-10-03T12:00:00Z,Oct,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/100324-johnson-democracy-at-work-20241003.html,"I first learned of King Arthur Baking Company during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when I joined the bandwagon and began baking my own bread. What initially drew me to the company were its recipes for delicious sourdough waffles and its flour’s high protein content. What kept me fixated on the company, though, was its corporate structure. King Arthur is 100% owned by its employees through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). Workers begin earning stock in the company once they’ve worked there for a year, providing both a nest egg for retirement and a direct interest in the company’s financial success. Moreover, workers — as co-owners — are directly engaged in the company’s decision-making.ESOPs are a particular form of workplace democracy, or the ""application of democratic practices, such as voting, debate and participatory decision-making systems, to the workplace."" Other forms include worker co-operatives, in which workers both own and fully control the company, and co-determination, in which control of the firm is split between shareholders and workers. Labor unions — while they do not give workers direct control or authority in decision-making — are a more indirect form, providing worker voice via collective bargaining with employers over wages and working conditions. If you’ve had an internship or any work experience during your time as a student, you have probably figured out that most U.S. workplaces are not bastions of democracy. Most workers in the U.S. and around the world exclusively earn an hourly wage or annual salary with little to no direct stake or say in what happens in their workplace. Production in most firms is organized through dictatorial control rather than democratic decision-making. Most of us have had little to no experience with democratic practices at work. Why should we care about this seemingly arcane aspect of corporate governance? For workers, studies overwhelmingly show that workplace democracy brings substantial benefits. Workers who begin their careers as ""employee-owners"" accrue more wealth than their counterparts at traditional firms. Unionsraisewages. Giving workers a ""seat at the table"" can ensure that companies’ decisions prioritize workers’ wellbeing, such as firing fewer workers during recessions. When Brock Barton, the current Chief Financial Officer of King Arthur, visited my class at the Sanford School in 2022, he described ""brainfood classes"" the company holds to increase workers’ financial literacy. This initiative wasn’t from the goodness of the management team’s hearts: it benefits the company to have owners who can read its balance sheet.What about effects on the rest of the economy? By construction, employee-owned firms are not owned by outside shareholders exclusively focused on maximizing profits. King Arthur’s co-CEO put it clearly when he said ""[w]e do not believe in growth for growth’s sake."" That said, there are lots of evidence that workplace democracy tends to increase firm productivity. Though perhaps surprising, the economics of this relationship is clear: having a direct stake in the company’s success gives employees a clear incentive to work hard. Adam Smith himself argued that the separation of ownership and control — endemic in shareholder-owned firms — inevitably results in ""negligence and profusion."" But perhaps the most profound impact of workplace democracy could be on democracy writ large. Employee ownership, co-determination or labor unions are political institutions that connect politics to outcomes that are tangible and consequential for individuals' lives. Experiencing democracy and its benefits at a micro scale provides a direct case for why democratic vitality is important at any scale, in the process promoting collectivity and a sense of common purpose. It is thus not surprising that exposure to participatory workplace practices leads individuals to be more critical of authoritarian government, and that coordinated policy efforts to weaken labor unions have led to quantifiable democratic backsliding. Despite these potential benefits to workers, consumers and citizens, workplace democracy really only exists on the fringes of the U.S. economy. About 8 percent of U.S. workers work in an ESOP; the share in worker co-operatives is much smaller, and co-determination is non-existent. Fewer than 10% of U.S. workers today are members of a labor union. On the face of it, one might wonder if workplace democracy has a place in today’s U.S. capitalist system. However, the present moment is a uniquely opportune one for workplace democracy. Americans overwhelmingly want democracy in their workplaces. The ongoing ""silver tsunami"" of baby boomers exiting the labor force means that millions of small business owners are retiring, many of which would be ripe for a transition to employee ownership. Americans’ approval of unions is at a near-record high, and the last two years have witnessed the biggest surge in union organizing in decades. For those of us concerned about the health and future of democracy in the U.S., maybe the first place we should look for inspiration is inside our own workplaces.

Bad hair… Who cares?,Valentina Garbelotto,2024-10-03T12:00:00Z,Oct,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/100224-garbelotto-bad-hair-20241003.html,"Last week, I cut baby bangs on a whim. Think mid-forehead, with my eyebrows peeking through like a glimpse of ankle in Victorian times. The reactions were very entertaining. One of my best friends asked me, “Why can I see your eyebrows?” I managed to put off FaceTiming my parents for a few days because I knew what they were going to say: a lot of “ohh, oh no” and “uhmm, it’s quite short.” My dad even compared me to an Argentine politician (thanks, I guess?). I used to look for external validation to feel confident about my hair but, after spending a few years undergoing various experiments with my hairstyle, my hair no longer feels like a massive weight on my shoulders.This past March, a week before my Spring Break trip with my gals, I decided to finally cut bangs. I had been cutting curtain bangs for a while, but I decided it was time to commit to the bit. I didn’t cut the blunt kind, but the open, parted-in-the-middle type that covers the forehead. I fell in love with them — exactly what I had envisioned on my mental Pinterest board — and I’ve been cutting them myself ever since.But it took me a while to find my style. Over the past few years, I’ve experimented with all sorts of cuts. When I was little, my mom gave me a side part that stuck with me throughout childhood. It wasn’t until I got curtain bangs in high school that I realized a middle part even existed. In high school, I developed trichotillomania — the compulsive urge to pull out hair — replacing my childhood habit of biting my nails with a new one. After a few months of oddly short strands of hair in some spots, I decided an undercut was the way to go. While it helped with the hair-pulling, it was horrid to grow back, so I transitioned to a bob. I came to Duke with that haircut and now have long locks.Now, I've had my fair share of disastrous haircuts. Once, I left the salon and cried for so long my mom thought something serious had happened. Another time, a botched bang trim led me to cancel plans with a friend as we were hanging out (yes, I’ve apologized). I developed a deep mistrust of salons and felt no one understood what I wanted. So I started to cut my own hair; it’s freeing to take scissors to your hair and know there’s no one to blame but yourself.Still, the first day with new bangs was nightmarish. It felt like everyone was seeing me for the first time, and those impressions weren’t necessarily flattering. But after a few days, I learned to rock them. If someone thinks something negative, I doubt they’ll have the balls to say it to my face. I wouldn’t care anyway, because it’s just hair and I’m still me.There’s a scene in ""Sex and the City"" where my favorite character is diagnosed with breast cancer. She loses her hair due to chemo and starts experimenting with wigs, and in the process, realizes her identity isn’t tied to her hair. At one point, she even lets go of the wigs, embracing her newly grown pixie cut. Before that season, her defining feature might have been her blonde locks, but no matter what hairstyle she rocked, she was still her same, fierce self. It got me thinking about how identity and hair — or any form of self-expression — can be two separate things.It’s safe to say we’ve probably all had bad hair days — ones where we’re internally screaming for it to cooperate. But relying on hair to determine our identities sets us up for failure. Hairstyles, like trends, are fleeting. And trying to keep up with what’s ""in"" or ""out"" means chasing a standard that constantly changes, rather than embracing our authentic selves. My hair has become a journey of self-discovery. Changing it reminds me that I’m not confined to one look or a single identity — I have the freedom to grow, evolve and transform, just like my hair. When life feels like it’s spiraling out of control, my hair is a way for me to regain it — it's like hitting refresh on my look and my mindset all at once.I’ve been told so many times that hair holds memories. But why should it become an embodiment of the past? For me, the haircuts become the memories. Each new style marks a beginning, turning my hair into a canvas for new experiences rather than a record of my history.Each haircut has taught me something new — whether it was accidentally tapping into my more masculine side, laughing at a happy accident (thank you, Bob Ross!) or turning how I saw myself upside down. There’s an undeniable sense of liberty in experimenting with your hair. It’s taking control of your own narrative, shaping it how you want. Hair grows with us, but it isn’t us.Cutting my own hair has also made me care less about how I present myself to others. If one strand is longer than the others, who cares? It’s okay to embrace the chaos, to laugh at the imperfections, and to learn as you go. The process of change is often more important than the result. If you accept that your hairstyle isn’t the ultimate measure of who you are, you open yourself up to a more vibrant and fluid sense of self. Hair is messy and fleeting, and so is life. Experimenting with different hairstyles shifts the focus from how others see you to how you see yourself. It’s a way to better understand your identity and realize that your true self isn’t defined by something as impermanent as hair.And here’s the thing: Your hair doesn’t have to be the only way you express yourself. It’s just one small part of a much bigger picture. Your interests, your passions, your values — those are the things that truly define who you are.Cutting your hair isn’t just for finding your style; it can also help you become more resilient and open to change. Each time you experiment with your look, you take ownership of your decisions, identity and personal chaos. You shape your narrative.Our confidence shouldn’t be tied to how we look, but rather to the true self-esteem that comes from within. So screw what people think about your acne, your jorts or your crocs. Life’s too short to care what others see when they look at you. Those who truly care will see you beyond the vessel you occupy.So, next time you see yourself in the mirror, I challenge you to question how you think about your hair. For me, hair is an accessory for self-expression, not a definition of who I am. Maybe it can be that for you, too.What are you waiting for? You never know what could happen until you grab some scissors and give it a try. After all, if a frat bro can rock a buzzcut, so can you.Valentina Garbelotto is a Trinity junior.

'A man was lynched today',Sonia Green,2024-10-02T12:00:00Z,Oct,2,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/100224-green-a-man-was-lynched-today-20241002.html,"In 2001, Marcellus Williams was convicted of the 1998 murder of Felicia Gayle, a former newspaper reporter. On Sept. 24, he died by lethal injection. Williams’ story exposes the cracks in our justice system that will continue to spread if we do not take action.Every few months we are bombarded with stories of people who have been in prison for decades for crimes they did not commit. Occasionally they are on death row, but usually, advocates are able to help them acquire their freedom. But this was the first time that I had seen one of these campaigns fail. This failure was extremely eye-opening to me as I had come to understand this as a cycle of outrage and resolution. It showed us all that it is possible to fight for innocent people behind bars and fail. The stakes in this case were life and death. A key detail in this story is race. Williams was a Black man convicted of the murder of a white woman. Despite the prevailing idea that we live in a ""post-racial"" society, this story is proof that we do not. Williams’ race played a role in his unjust conviction, denied appeals and untimely passing. For generations, Black males have been punished when crimes were committed against white women, even when evidence was marginal at best. The story of Emmet Till stands as a prime example. At only 14 years old, he was brutally murdered after allegedly whistling at a white woman. This brings forth the question; why is it that a Black man’s claim of innocence is seldom respected? In Williams’ case, aside from his word, he also had attorneys from both sides, the victim's family and the Innocence Project (a nonprofit that uses DNA and other scientific advancements to prove wrongful conviction) all fighting against his execution. Even their words and the evidence they presented proved not to be enough. Perhaps the most disheartening part of this story is that Missouri’s Republican governor Michael Parson also had the power to intervene but chose not to, stating: ""Nothing from the real facts of this case have led me to believe in Mr. Williams’ innocence, as such, Mr. Williams’ punishment will be carried out as ordered by the Supreme Court.""I do not write this to sadden the Duke community. All we can do is pray for the family and friends of Marcellus Williams as they grieve. I write this in order to demonstrate exactly why it is important for all of us to vote. This is not a question of releasing ""criminals"" back onto the street. It’s about how we value human life. It is estimated that approximately 4.1% of people on death row are likely innocent. This may seem like a marginal number of people, but in a country that professes to be built on ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"" there is a clear contradiction. This is why we must vote in every election. Even in seemingly small elections or when we feel that no one candidate is perfect, we must vote. Voting ensures that we are not rushing at the end to prevent the death of an innocent man, but that we are putting people in power who will actually listen to the appeals brought forth in the court of law. As an African American, I was extremely disheartened when I received news of Marcellus Williams’ execution. I walked around campus deeply saddened and I could barely go on Instagram without seeing a post about Williams’ execution. I did, however, come across a post by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) that stated “A man was lynched today” and I cannot help but agree.

Two icebergs on the way to the 2024 election,John Aldrich,2024-10-01T12:00:00Z,Oct,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/100124-aldrich-two-icebergs-20241001.html,"Roughly 10% of an iceberg is visible, standing above the water line. Most of it is hidden. While 2024 has been a dramatic, even shocking, election season already, who knows what is yet to come that we don’t know about. Like what George W. Bush’s Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, called the ""known unknowns,"" there are at least two more icebergs to come this campaign. We know a little about what is happening with them, but 90% is yet to be seen, and that 90% could make all the difference.One iceberg is voter registration. There are various groups that need to register to be able to vote in 2024: young people reaching voting age since 2022, new citizens, those who have moved sufficiently across border lines that they need to register at their new location — and a very large number of citizens who either have never registered or who have failed to vote for so long that their names have been ""purged"" from voter rolls and therefore need to register to be able to vote in 2024. Registering enough folks to vote for your party’s candidates can make all the difference. This is true in the presidential battleground states, but it is true of many other contests, too. The Montana Senate race, for example, is a close contest, even though the presidential contest in Montana is decidedly not close. Virtually every state will have a number of close contests, and adept registration drives might be enough to pull victory out of the jaws of defeat. For the most part (maybe for that unseen 90%), we have no idea or way to figure out how voter registration is going. This became clear when enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket surged after President Biden withdrew. There is convincing evidence that registration drives are reporting more success than before, but by how much, where, and even more importantly, by how much more than for the other side? We don’t and possibly can’t tell, — at least until after the election.The second iceberg is election administration. This includes rules changes since 2020 or 2022, some of which we can observe, but it also includes the administration of rules. Stories mount of the Republican Party seeking to appoint local election administrators favorable to their side. How successful have these efforts been? We have some sense of this, but basically, who knows? More importantly, how have the rules changed and what are the choices they face in turning those new rules into the actual administration of elections? The pandemic caused many states and localities to change how early voting, absentee voting, voterregistration and other aspects were implemented. Because those new procedures were designed to make it easier for people to vote, it tended overall to help Democrats, but not by that much. At least that is what the best current research seems to be saying, but that is research that is still coming out — four years after the fact. What does this mean for 2024? Just like voter registration drives, election administration happens most fully at the local level, making it hard to see the full picture — indeed, to see much of the picture at all. To be sure, from what we can see from the 10% of the iceberg, it seems to be working to the benefit of Republicans. But the other 90%? Who knows?Perhaps there will be more substantive “October surprises” to come yet this campaign. But even if not, we do know that registration drives and election administration will make a difference. We just don’t know how big a difference — or who they will help and by how much.John Aldrich is the Pfizer-Pratt University Distinguished Professor of Political Science.This piece is part of the “Virtues of Democracy” column, a series of op-eds by faculty and student contributors across Trinity College and the Sanford School of Public Policy.

To each their hall of mirrors,Paul Dilly,2024-10-01T12:00:00Z,Oct,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/100124-dilly-hall-of-mirrors-20241001.html,"Editor's note: This article mentions an eating disorder.We all have our own perspective, our own point of view. And we all so often think we come to know a thing by our experiences with it. (This is known as anecdotal fallacy, in which personal experiences are extrapolated to make dangerous generalizations.) But we don’t. Not really. Not even close, actually. Especially when it comes to people. How could we? We are infinite beings in an infinite universe; there’s no way anyone could really understand you. Even your closest loved ones can’t possibly articulate all of you. Except you. You are the only one with the key to all your mirrors — all the angles into your soul that, when brought together, comprise YOU. Others have access only to a handful of your mirrors and, as such, can just make out pieces of you: the pieces you let them see, the pieces they want to see. They are blind to the rest. (This idea is inspired by John Green’s novel “Paper Towns.”)That’s where the fallacy comes in. We make assumptions about someone based on our limited collection of their mirrors. Then, once we’ve rationalized and categorized them, we label them (think “The Breakfast Club”). Heck, I pick people apart before I’ve even met them. Tall dudes sporting varsity jackets? Frat bros who only eat at Kraft. Professors who don’t curve exams when the average is a 60? Horrible people who deserve to have their tenure reconsidered. I could go on.Whether those labels are true or not doesn’t matter; regardless, we've stripped them of their infinity and squashed them into a one-dimensional Flat Stanley. Because that’s how we can explain them to ourselves. But there’s more to varsity jackets than burgers and sports, and there’s more to no curves than sadistic fascination with student suffering. Let others squash you — they ain’t got the mirrors to understand you anyway. Whatever you do, though, don’t squash yourself. It’s all too easy to pretend some of your mirrors aren’t there. I know, because I’ve done it.I used to think that Real Me was a good person, that I was naturally amiable, respectful, kind. Sure, I am those things… most of the time. But sometimes I’m irritable, standoffish, annoying. I scowl at teachers and professors as I stalk into their classroom early in the morning. I ignore friends and cancel hangouts. I pout in pictures (pitiful, I know). I half-ass work. I self-sabotage. I don’t follow through on projects, relationships, meetings. I show up late. (I think I should stop now….) I would write those times off as bad days, telling myself excuses: I’m not acting like myself because I’m not feeling like myself. If I were feeling better… I’d smile. I’d be the life of the party. I’d work hard. I’d take care of myself. I’d be on time. I’d be the good, fun, joyful person I know myself to be.The problem? I hooked my identity on conditionals, telling myself lies to save face. I refused to acknowledge the parts of me I didn’t like, instead blaming their manifestation on my circumstances. I willed myself to believe the only accurate mirrors were those that reflected me on good days.But the bad days were Real Me too, those mirrors just as accurate. Just because my day, month, year, life wasn’t going the way I wanted it to go didn’t make my response to it — and the person I was in that moment — any less real. (In fact, I’d argue the opposite: It only matters who you are when things get hard. Anyone can do good when they feel good.) It wasn’t life forcing me to take my problems out on others; it was me. My mirrors don’t lie.So long as I ignored my mirrors and remained in denial about who I was, I stayed stuck in the same ol’ shit with the same ol’ me. How could I possibly change when I ignored the possibility of needing to change? When I accepted that I wasn’t a perfect little angel — that I was, in fact, a crappy person half the time — I was finally free to begin taking steps toward changing myself for the better. In this way, I came to like and appreciate Real Me, instead of fantasizing about how awesome Pretend Me was.You ain’t perfect. Odds are, you kinda suck. Don’t pretend. No one’s fooled. Deep down, not even you. You might be thinking, “Why should I care if I’m an asswipe? I’m already awesome in other ways. I’ll just work on making the awesome parts of me even better.” But you can’t separate the good from the bad. I tried. And — spoiler alert — I failed.I had so entrenched myself in the belief that I was awesome and perfect — that Pretend Me was Real Me — that the only way I thought I could get any better was through improving the reflections of me I already liked. So that’s what I did.I was athletic, so I wanted six-pack abs. I was gifted, so I wanted success. At face value, those desires were okay. But I wanted them so badly I didn’t stop to acknowledge my tendency to go overboard — especially when it comes to my ambitions (hence my impatience to accomplish them). So, when I started pursuing these goals, I failed to go about them in a healthy, sustainable way.I became anorexic and lost twenty pounds. I threw myself at internship applications and resume boosters, to the point where I was so stressed and exhausted I could hardly walk (check out my other articles if you want more on THAT drama). I had abs and bullet points, sure, but I’d broken those mirrors — those pieces of myself — in the process.But what if I hadn’t been pretending? I would’ve recognized Real Me’s excessive ambition as a byproduct of not being enough for myself. I would’ve understood that, so long as I remained in this state of self-discontentment, I was a threat to myself — because I was willing to stop at nothing to change the person I saw in the mirror (literally). I would have seen how I could end up hurting myself and consequently been able to ensure that didn’t happen by adapting my method of achieving those goals — working out more rather than eating (wayyy) less, for example. In this way, I would have accomplished what I set out to do without compromising myself and my health in the process. So, not only did my pretending forfeit any chance of fixing the bad, but it also stunted the good. Way to go, me! Needless to say…Don’t do what I did. Your mirrors deserve better. You deserve better. You can run, you can hide, you can break, you can lie — no matter what, you cannot escape yourself. So, go ahead: Stare at your reflections until you’ve come to terms with who you are. You don’t have to like what you see — you may even hate it — but you have to be ok with it. After all, you can’t choose the mirrors you want to keep; you’re stuck with all of you. And, if you really do want to better yourself, you can’t expect the best of yourself without first accepting the worst. Otherwise, you’ll launch yourself off the deep end and wind up hurting yourself — as I so brutally learned so you didn’t have to. (You’re welcome.)You can’t possibly discover all of your mirrors; infinity is a pretty big number, after all. If you go looking, though, you can get pretty damn close. So you might as well get started. Your very own hall of mirrors awaits.Paul Dilly is a Trinity junior. "

Polls and prejudice,Cara Eaton,2024-09-30T12:00:00Z,Sep,30,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/093024-eaton-polls-and-prejudice-20240930.html,"Duke is fantastic in mobilizing us to vote. Every day I walk by Bryan Center Plaza, a dedicated group is hawking cookies, stuffed animals and cotton candy to whomever will spare five minutes and fill out the registration form. The students themselves seem to respond in kind. The Duke Votes student group is particularly dedicated, pulling a surprising number of participants dedicated to mobilizing their peers. The partisan groups join them in their mission – the Duke Democrats and Ciceronian Society even co-hosted a debate watch party at the Devil’s Krafthouse for the first presidential debate. The turnout was beyond my imagination. All of this is symptomatic of a politically healthy university. Duke students want to create voters. And creating voters in one of the most key battleground states is pretty noble. Yet, for some of us, a perfidious rhetoric lurks behind the casual invitation to vote. Sometimes, when a peer (or a professor!) asks us to vote, it comes with the unspoken double meaning of ""You should vote for who I think you should vote for.""Which is why I find myself apologizing and tripping over myself after telling people I was planning to vote for a third-party candidate for president. I don’t like the establishment options. I’m doing it on principle. I know it’s equivalent to throwing away my vote, but...Feeling like I have to apologize for picking a candidate that is most aligned with my points of view (on war and foreign policy, on individual choice, on criminal justice reform, etc.) just because they’re not an establishment option is depressing. Of course, this is not a Duke-specific issue, but rather an effect of our generation being more polarized than ever. Still, why shouldn’t we have this conversation here at Duke? There are so many issues on the political front that Duke is willing to accommodate. We don’t hold back from tough conversations. Yet, I haven’t really encountered anyoneopen and willing to talk about political shame and the effects it can have on a student’s social life. You’re damned if you say you’re voting blue or red in the presence of a deeply seated member of the opposite party. You’re damned if you say you’re voting third party. You’re also damned if you decline to answer or claim that you won’t vote at all (just look at pop star Chappell Roan’s recent initial hesitation to endorse any candidate for president and the hysterics that followed).This is not to say that everyone is not willing to befriend or even hear out someone who doesn’t share their opinions. But there’s definitely a faction of peers who will not hear you out. They will tell you to vote and then side-eye you when you don’t agree to vote for who they implicitlyare asking you to vote for. And humans being self-protectionist creatures, many of us will then simply not speak our mind. And what a shame that is. Most anyone will criticize establishment politics, and hardly anyone will talk about avenues to change the two-party system. If intelligent young people refuse to accommodate the idea of voting for a third party, the system will never change. That’s the bigger picture, and it’s rather abstract but worth thinking about. More pertinent to this column are the day-to-day social consequences. College is hard enough without trying to psychoanalyze the political leanings of your conversation partner (a game largely based on stereotypes, anyway), respond in kind and then walk away feeling ashamed on principle of not fully expressing your true opinions. Those brave enough to express their true opinions to the fullest extent don’t often win themselves many friends, except in hyper-specific circles of people with their same opinion. Apologies, but I envision a world where universities are more than these circles. Sitting outside of the Devil’s Krafthouse, watching the debate and knowing that at least some of the members of the Duke Democrats and the Ciceronian Society worked together to make such an event happen was a sign of hope. Collaboration and amnesty between left- and right-wing students is a fine first step. I hope that this little bit of open-mindedness between whomever involved can spread to localized conversations around campus and extend to people who have radically different or just plain radical ideas about who and what to vote for. I hope we can incentivize voting without the fine print of who to vote for. Besides, I think you’ll be surprised about what happens if you just let people really speak their truth. Many of the people who have seemingly radical ideas have surprisingly rational justifications. And, hey, even if we don’t leave the conversation convinced, at least we did our part in creating a little connection between two separate circles of thought. At least we’re not complicit in the contagion of political shame. Enough conversation and free and open thought and we can really change the social and political landscapes of Duke. Wriggle free of your shame in having what you believe to be a less-than-desirable political opinion, show others the same respect and perhaps we can eventually work toward a societal microcosm that represents a new way forward for our generation: a way that abolishes the old establishment conventions and in which we stick to the principles of our word.

I hate Duke’s sodding grass,Shambhavi Sinha,2024-09-30T12:00:00Z,Sep,30,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/093024-sinha-hate-sodding-grass-20240930.html,"As the freshmen run around for orientation week, and summer is nearing its carefree end, Duke prepares all around for the coming academic year. From replacing common room furniture in Edens (it’s the least they can do to remedy that place) to installing HVAC upgrades for Brodie Aquatics, summer has been the time for change. Now, as a sophomore, I cannot confirm how common or uncommon it is, but it is the second — maybe third — time I’ve witnessed the grass be replaced since my time here. I would not deny that I was surprised by the lush lawns the first time I came to Duke. They’re vibrant, and in conjunction with the Georgian style architecture distinct to the East and the towering trees well cared for on the quad, it seemed like the opening shot of some light academia coming-of-age film. Enveloped by the stirring sunshine, the chirping birds, and the buzzing bees, I often found myself possessed by the spirit of Keats. But not all that is beautiful lasts.As the semester went on and we all buried ourselves in coursework — the glorious free time from orientation week felt like trying to recall a dream from last night — the atmosphere grew tense every time the pre-meds had another organic chemistry midterm, and East felt it too. By November, the grass on East was a depressing, dead shade of ochre. Even by the end of spring, hints of the yellow remained. Perhaps it is my (sub)tropical origins speaking, but it was not an overstatement to say that it felt depressing relative to its former glory. So then, color me surprised when I return to East — during the summer — to find the grass green again. Suddenly, it was as if I had become my freshman-year self. Nothing had changed. The lawns were the same. I was the same. Or was I even ever there? No trace of me existed. The lawn in front of the Classroom Building I had laid on for hours did not exist. Nor did the lawn where I watched ""Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse."" None of that remained. The lawns I once loved, now made me feel sick: Because what I loved was never real. All the lawns I know have been “natural”: Even if they were planted with intention, they grew at their pace, by their own choice. There were no carpets of perfectly uniform, green grass; they seemed to suggest more theideaof a lawn than a lawn itself. There was inherent randomness. I do not know why what I thought was superficially beautiful could give me so much grief, but I still despise these lawns. They lack the individuality I desperately crave, the chaos of nature. They lack the unique spark in their eyes, the passion for changing the world. They seem to become dimmer after the rain, rather than brighter. They somehow all want to work in investment banks. For some reason, they need sprinklers on for them during severe thunderstorms. In ways more than one, the lawns are a reflection of us. Everyone brings their fresh selves in the fall, but it is us falling apart by the end of the year. We all pretend. We all perform. Put on masks of pretend intellect, and engage in superficial conversations. Some even refuse to engage with others at depth, and others don’t even try to know themselves. And if these lawns all are the same, what does that say about who we all are? Are we all the same despite our unique quirks and distinct backgrounds? Are we all just transported here, watered and made to seem appealing, and we eventually leave (statistically, to a consulting firm)? We all are brought here, from our unique backgrounds and perspectives into East Campus. Bright-eyed, fresh-faced barely adults who want to change the world. But as we are planted, we all start resembling each other. Conversations start becoming less about impact-making, and more about profit-making. We all are diverse on paper — on the surface — but these unique quirks and perspectives converge. We conform to what performances are expected of us and mold ourselves to the mold of superficial intellect that recruiters crave. And this inauthenticity of thought, of engagement, translates and pervades our lives here: No matter how hard we try to retain the memories from our time here, or try to leave our mark on the ground, nothing will remain. Why? Because every year, they strip them. Who knows where they end up? Maybe in some Gothic-style composting unit. Maybe in some boutique investment bank. We will forget each other despite the countless ties that connect us. Despite the fifteen gigabytes worth of pictures on the cloud, none of these memories will follow us. No sophomore, junior or senior notices the difference: After all, the grass is basically the same, right? No freshman recognizes the history in the grass, because there is none. We tried to make our marks, as will they. And eventually, someone will come strip them and delude the next class into trying to make their marks. We will keep making our marks on these lawns, only for them to fade to obscurity.Shambhavi Sinha is a Trinity sophomore. Her pieces typically run on alternate Mondays."
We should reimagine our vending machines,Zubin Rekhi,2024-09-28T12:00:00Z,Sep,28,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092824-rehki-reimagine-vending-machines-20240928.html,"If, like me, you study late into the night as midterm season approaches, you probably also enjoy taking late-night snack breaks through vending machines. While sipping on Diet Coke and snacking on Doritos from a vending machine in Perkins last week, I had a late-night realization: what if I wanted healthier food at 12:30 AM? And why was it that vending machines, which are ubiquitous on campus, could not house things students need more immediately than junk food, including over-the-counter medicines, like Tylenol, and stationary for classes, like extra calculators? It occurred to me that I haven’t looked into how Duke limits the potential uses for vending machines, which form an unparalleled distribution network on campus that’s lying latent.Vending machines, by definition, house non-perishable, processed food whose lifespans can last long enough that their contents don’t go stale by the time we consume them. But not all non-perishable foods are as unhealthy as Lays chips — there are some that house Kind bars, trail mix, Cliff Bars and stick to non-sugary beverages. Others, like the ones from which I usually procure late-night snacks, stick to high-caloric foods. Considering the dearth of other food options on campus after 10 PM — which are essentially limited to Pitchforks, McDonald’s, or vending machines — the contents of vending machines should be more rigorously scrutinized through the lens of nutritional value. College students have notoriously off-kilter sleep times, particularly at Duke; considering that, it would be nice if instead of eating greasy McDonald’s fries or potato chips, we could also eat more raisins or trail mix late at night.In addition to stocking healthier foods, vending machines should house other necessities that provide Duke students more utility than junk food, especially given their ubiquity on a large campus. Our campus is large and cumbersome to traverse. A 10-minute long shuttle ride separates one half of the student body from the other and another 5-10 minute walk separates our dorms, classes, cafeterias, pharmacies and hangout spots from the shuttle. Those of us with cars who go off campus to buy necessities have to trek five to ten minutes to parking spots in Blue Zone and drive to off-campus grocery stores and pharmacies with the uncertainty of knowing whether an empty parking space awaits us when we get back. Everyone would save unneeded time and stress if they had daily necessities closer to where they ate, studied, worked or hung out, stocked conveniently in vending machines.So in addition to stocking healthier non-perishable foods, vending machines should be stocked with stationary, like G2 pens, small notebooks and Texas Instrument scientific calculators; health products, including over-the-counter medication like Tylenol or allergy medicine, first-aid kits and contraception; and other miscellaneous goods like nail clippers. The products offered in vending machines could be tailored to the building they are in: stationary vending machines could be placed in the library while health products could be housed closer to our dorms. Product mixes could also change with the time of year: during spring allergy season, more health machines can stock allergy medication; during LDOC, more can stock electrolyte and hydration pouches. A re-imagination does not require buying new machines: vending machines often occur in pairs, so we could re-stock one per each duplicative set of machines across campus buildings so that they contain health or stationery products rather than more junk food.Reimagining vending machines might seem like a tall task that overlooks what can be feasibly implemented but it is, in fact, long overdue and completely achievable. For starters, Duke already does have health and stationary machines, although not enough of them: there’s a stationary vending machine in Bostock library and a few health-focused machines in Bryant Center and on East Campus. It should expand its offerings by modifying the contents of its existing machines. UNC, by contrast, has three health-specific vending machines: one in the Carolina Union, another in the Health Center, and a third in their Gillings School of Public Health. Those machines provide sick students with medicines and the remedies they need after hours and are conveniently located in UNC’s Student Union. Yale also opened a chain of sexual health-focused vending machines. Given the benefits that reimaging vending machines could bring students, I believe it’s high time the administration should consider doing so. Zubin Rekhi is a Trinity junior.

Imagining the restorative justice crime drama,Nik Narain,2024-09-28T12:00:00Z,Sep,28,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092824-narain-restorative-justice-crime-drama-20240928.html,"Whenever my older sibling came home from college, there was one thing we’d always make time to do: watch ""Criminal Minds,""marathon-style. This 2005 hit crime procedural was a foundational component of our relationship as we both transitioned into confused and concerned adults with our own weekly mysteries to solve. It’s also just an all-around good show, with its 17 seasons, multiple awards and priceless Matthew Gray Gubler memes to show for it. ""Criminal Minds"" is part of the much longer list of procedural drama TV shows, shows in which a conflict is introduced and resolved completely in the span of one (usually hour-long) episode. While they don’t necessarily have to center around law enforcement agencies, many of them do, such as ""Bones,"" ""Miami Vice,"" ""NCIS,"" ""Law & Order SVU,"" ""The Blacklist""; the list goes on. Americans love cop dramas — they’re digestible due to their comprehensive narrative structure, thrilling due to their life-and-death stakes and deeply satisfying due to their ability to answer big questions so concisely (who did it, how, why, etc.). We always know the “good guys” will be rewarded and the ""bad guys"" will be punished. We always know the case will be solved and all will be well in the time span of baking a lasagna. It’s no surprise why we keep making more of these shows and extending them for, at times, decades.In 2020, the Color for Change Hollywood project put forth a study on how TV's scripted crime genre excludes writers of color, miseducates people about the criminal justice system and normalizes injustice from the comfort of our screens. The study, in collaboration with the USC Annenberg Norman Lear Center, coded 353 episodes across 26 crime-related scripted television series in the 2017–2018 season. To put it another way, several undergraduate and graduate students watched hundreds of hours of crime shows and analyzed its scenes and characters in the name of science. The researchers found that the majority of shows depicted their criminal justice professionals committing wrongful actions, such as conducting searches without a warrant, shooting without a cause, forcing confessions and racially profiling, among other things. They did so in a way that depicted these actions as normal and necessary in the pursuit of justice. Viewers were least likely to see victims of crimes portrayed by women of color, which is unrepresentative of national crime statistics. Out of 275 writers and 27 showrunners, 81% of showrunners and 81% of writers were white, with the majority of series having no or just one black writer. Finally, almost all shows did not discuss any of the problems within the criminal justice system, and conveyed the sense that any ""ineffectiveness"" within the system was due to bad police officers rather than structural issues of racism, sexism and abuse of power built into the system.I read these critical findings with a rather hypocritical eye. On the one hand, I’m a staunch advocate for restorative justice. I believe that criminal justice should have its focus shifted from punishment to accountability and from institutionalization to reparation. I believe that restorative justice is critical to conflict prevention and has been shown to be effective in conflict resolution compared to traditional approaches. I believe that our current criminal justice system is in need of deep structural repair and that prisons and jails don’t keep people safe and don’t ""solve crime"" at all. But on the other hand, it’s clear my patterns of media consumption have revolved around the enjoyment of storytelling centering around a corrupt justice system, one that fundamentally contradicts these values. It’s undeniable that media sensationalizing and celebrating a retributive justice system is only part of the problem.In 2019, CNN released a single season of ""The Redemption Project with Van Jones,"" an eight-part TV series that offered a rare glimpse into the restorative justice process from real-world cases. A smattering of one-off local news specials, documentaries and short-form content has been instrumental to increasing awareness about restorative justice. The hashtag #restorativejustice on TikTok has over 5,000 posts alone. But what about scripted stories and new series pitches? To fictionalize the restorative justice process in its variety of methods makes the phenomenon more accessible, more humanized, more real. To introduce a conflict and resolve it through conversation and action; to focus stories of “crime” on the people involved in the situation rather than an external agency; to highlight the inequities of our legal system in a way that is nuanced yet still optimistic, all within the span of an hour — I think that would be an amazing feat of television. What if we had show creators, showrunners and entire writer’s rooms imagining what a nonviolent form of conflict resolution might look like cinematically, not solely as a tool for exploring and celebrating abolitionist movements, but as an overall solid piece of drama television? TV is one of the biggest ways we learn about the world. With crime TV being one of the most popular genres, media has played a major role in shaping our relationship with crime and punishment, sometimes as major as the policies around criminal justice themselves. It’s certainly not my position to tell you what to watch and not watch, but perhaps this piece can offer a nuanced perspective on the dark realities of these stories that not only miseducate but perpetuate harmful ideas about crime that inevitably contribute to real-life violence. If we want to advocate for a world of nonviolent conflict resolution and trauma-informed justice practices, we must have entertainment that reflects that. Nik Narain is a Trinity senior.

Community members share remembrances for Dean Gerald Wilson,Remembrances,2024-09-27T11:00:00Z,Sep,27,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092724-remembrances-to-gerald-wilson-20240927.html,"I just saw the very sad news that Dean Gerald Wilson passed away, and I'm writing to share my remembrance of Dean Wilson. He helped me through one of the worst days of my life — he cared for me. It was extraordinary, and yet, it was one of a zillion things that Gerald Wilson did for Duke students. Let me tell you my story about him.In December 1981, I was a senior at Duke. I was applying to law schools, and like all Duke students doing so at that time, I met with Dean Wilson and got his advice. I had no special relationship with him. On December 14, 1981, during final exams, I learned that my father had very unexpectedly passed away of a massive heart attack. It was such shocking news. I didn't sleep a wink that night as I tried to process the news. The next morning, I went to the exam I was supposed to take and told the professor what happened. He said there was no need to take the exam. I had several hours to kill before my flight left RDU. For reasons I can't quite explain, I decided to see Dean Wilson. I knocked on his office door in the Allen Building, and I told him what had happened. He was so caring, so compassionate, so understanding and so giving. At the end of the conversation, I thanked him, and he got up from his desk and hugged me. A few days later, he called me to see how I was doing. I never forgot the extraordinary compassion of Gerald Wilson.Dean Brenner, Trinity '82~~~~~Gerald Wilson was my academic adviser when I was a Duke undergraduate from 1968 to 1972. He always had an encouraging word, and pointed me in the right direction. It was clear that he cared deeply about his students. In recent years, he would stop to visit me and my golden retriever on campus as we sat on one of the West Campus benches. He remembered me even after all the years that had passed. His dedication to Duke made it a better place for all. He will be missed.Keith Upchurch, Trinity '72~~~~~Dean Wilson was a wise and compassionate administrator. He helped two generations of our Duke family, and we will be forever grateful for that. His door was always open when old friends dropped by, and always a cheerful, encouraging but clear-eyed presence. Mark I. Pinsky, Trinity '70; Sallie Brown, '71; Asher Brown-Pinsky, Trinity '10; Liza Brown-Pinsky, Trinity '13~~~~~I am writing upon hearing of the passing of Dean Gerald Wilson. Dean Wilson was a life-changing figure in my life, both as a wonderful professor and as the pre-law Dean. I took both of Dean Wilson's small seminars, ""American Dreams, American Realities"" and ""Leadership in American History."" Although I took these courses over two decades ago, I still remember being so inspired by his teaching and learned to think very deeply and analytically. The lessons that I took away from his courses have served me so well in my life, personally and professionally. And speaking of professionally, Dean Wilson helped me get off of the waitlist at NYU Law School with one or two swift, strategic moves immediately following my graduation from Duke in 2000. Attending NYU Law School was another life-changing experience for me and opened so many doors professionally, which ultimately paved the way for me to have the fulfilling and exciting legal career that I've had so far. I visited Duke in February of this year with my 15-year old son, Sam. While we were on campus, we were lucky enough to sit down with Dean Wilson for a coffee and a chat. Dean Wilson was so warm and engaging with Sam and immediately asked him to start thinking about how he would answer the question of ""Who are you?"" — so that Sam could answer the question by the end of our visit. Sam answered Dean Wilson at the end of our visit, and I can't recall much of Sam's response and the particulars of what he and Dean Wilson discussed. I do recall, however, that such a simple question posed to Sam has already made such a huge difference in his life, as well, as it got him thinking about who he is as a learner and as a person and has inspired him to be the best version of himself. After our visit with Dean Wilson that day, Sam turned to me and said, ""Now I see why you loved going to college here so much. Dean Wilson is amazing."" Below is a photo of Dean Wilson and me from my Duke graduation in 2000, a photo of Dean Wilson and me and a photo of Dean Wilson and my son, Sam, both from our visit in February.I will never forget Dean Wilson and the impact that he had on my life and that he has potentially had on the life of my son. I offer my heartfelt condolences to his family. May his memory be a blessing for all who knew and loved him.Shelby (Granowitz) Weiser, Trinity '00~~~~~Gerald Wilson made thousands of Duke students consider how American history shaped the America in which they lived, and he made them laugh along the way. “My point,” he told me in a 2013 email, “is that to understand public issues fully you need to know their origins and course of development, i.e., history. OK, so much for the sermon.”He helped shepherd hundreds more students along the precarious path to law school as the pre-law advisor, which he called his penance for his own close decision to attend seminary rather than law school. He impacted, influenced, reassured and encouraged countless more as a dean and in myriad other roles over his six decades at Duke. He liked to call himself an enabler; he wanted to empower young adults to find their paths, accomplish great things and leave the world a little better than they found it.Dean Wilson was a keen listener, even as the maestro conducting the sometimes reluctant and occasionally unprepared orchestra of a hundred-seat lecture. When he heard something promising that deserved a fuller explanation, he amped up his old-South accent to deliver his favorite exhortation: “Say more words!” The Duke Divinity School alumnus spent a quarter-century as a Presbyterian church pastor along with his increasing responsibilities on campus. He was serious about religion, but not self-serious: “Piety is not one of my vices.”Dean Wilson was steeped in history, religion, and the South — where he quipped that he first learned about the Civil War from a teacher who hadn’t realized it was over. He bridged the past and the present for generations of young people. He meditated on the American character, with particular insight into his native region and such a memorable way of speaking that I jotted down quotes in my lecture notes: “We southerners sin just as much, even as you Californians — but we enjoy it more, because we feel so guilty.”His most popular course took a skeptical look at the idea of the American dream, noting many ways that groups were excluded from its pursuit throughout our nation’s history, but he was ultimately optimistic about America’s future. He said our growing diversity made the country not a melting pot but a gumbo, where different flavors rubbed off on each other and improved the whole without necessarily ceding their original identity.I was blessed to know Gerald, as he insisted I call him after graduating in 2015. I took his always-full lecture course on “American Dreams, American Realities” and his seminar on leadership in American history. He sponsored my thesis project and the thousand-mile summer road trip that provided the research; his ceaseless curiosity and excitement sustained my own. He attended my wedding a few years later, but only after warning me with a literary paraphrase that a groom is “a minor character in the story of his own wedding.” After another few years, he supported me when I decided to pursue law school, promising his recommendation letter was “one of the best pieces of fiction I have ever written.” Gerald was a beloved academic grandfather to so many of us. A half-century after his first Duke degree, he remained insatiably and infectiously curious. He inspired his many students to understand more about this nation’s past, to impact its present, and to hope for its future.Shortly before graduation, I signed off on an email to Gerald, “Your student always.” That farewell holds true today. Andrew Kragie, Trinity '15~~~~~I first met Gerald Wilson around 1962, when he had interviewed me for the position of Housemaster (supervising a Men’s Freshmen Dorm) on the West Campus; he was the Head Housemaster. Gerald was an impressive figure even then, looking serious and well dressed — like a lawyer. I remember that he asked me, among other things, what books I was reading outside of the curriculum at the time. I got the job.Getting to know him, I found that he was a very intelligent, capable and kind person with a good sense of humor. In later years he was also very helpful to my son, Aydin (E ’01), and to my daughter Peri (T ’04). As a consequence, my wife Engin and I had the pleasure of meeting Dean Wilson and his gracious wife Ginger in later years as well. Dean Gerald Wilson will be missed, and remembered with admiration as well as affection.M. Esat Kadaster, Pratt ’64~~~~~Learning of Dean Gerald Wilson's death brought back memories and reflections of 4 specific meetings I had with him at Duke. His wise guidance and advice helped shape several key life decisions. Like many freshmen, my initial transition from New York City to Duke was not simple. I met with Dean Wilson late first semester and expressed an interest in transferring from Duke. He was generous with his time and was warm and thoughtful. Our conversation was extremely helpful. I never submitted the transfer applications. During my sophomore year, I was confused about what major I should commit to. As a junior, I had a serious issue with a professor in that major (Art History). Both times, I sought out Dean Wilson's counsel and he provided true insight in an empathetic manner. Finally, a few years after I graduated, I was considering applying to law school. I reached out to Dean Wilson again. He remembered me and was excited to discuss my ideas and questions. He recommended a few schools and offered to support my applications. I went to Boston University School of Law (where I met my wife), enjoyed a long legal career and am now a senior corporate executive.4 specific meetings that helped shape my life. I never really thanked Dean Wilson for his support and guidance... until today.Thank you Gerald Wilson! May your memory be a blessing.Michael Kaminsky, Trinity '80~~~~~Gerald Wilson was a celebrated teacher, trusted pastor and legendary adviser to generations of law school applicants, but I remember him most as a friend, one of the closest I’ve had.I schemed my way into his graces at the start of my sophomore year. Thinking I wanted to go to law school, I sought out the pre-law dean and asked to be his work-study student. He said he didn’t need a work-study student. Then he hired me anyway. Generosity was Gerald’s first instinct.The job, which lasted three years, largely involved talking to Gerald. We talked about everything: southern history, Gandhi, the New Deal, the appeal of fried chicken for breakfast, class anger, my romantic quandaries, why an omnipotent God permits evil and suffering, whether America could deliver the American Dream. Gerald was both a wise elder and a co-conspirator, a pal. He listened to me, had faith in me, poked fun at me. He made me feel empowered. My friends were surprised to discover a man with all those honorifics — “the Reverend Doctor Dean” — was, to use a term not yet coined, so ""relatable."" Trudging to the library one afternoon, I found him headed to the Gardens with my girlfriend, hooky on both of their faces. Law school advising, they said.A turning point in my time at Duke involved a plan to spend a summer in India doing volunteer work. There were lots of reasons not to go, including the cost. Gerald told me to follow my heart and jump-started the fund-raising with small grants from three rural churches he served as a part-time pastor. I returned to the churches to describe my adventures and discovered another side of Gerald — the anchor of small-town life, proclaiming the faith far from the cosmopolitan campus. He belonged to both habitats.The trip changed my life. I wrote about it for a campus publication and moved on to a career in journalism, thanks in large part to Gerald. I rushed off on a reporting trip after graduation and stored a trunk in his house.When I returned to Duke half a lifetime later to help my son move in, Gerald was a figure of fame. His course, American Dreams, filled a large hall and spawned a waiting list. (I was flattered that one of its readings came from my book ""American Dream."") Gerald stopped by the hotel to visit — with the trunk in his car. It had been living in his attic, rent-free, for nearly 40 years. My wife was astonished: Who stores a student’s stuff for that long?If he minded, he didn’t show it. We all carry debts we can never repay, but what a list I compiled with Gerald!Jason DeParle, Trinity '82~~~~~Dean Gerald Wilson was a legendary pre-law advisor, but in his part-time job as a Presbyterian minister, he offered me counseling that changed my life. As a potential seminary student, I sought Gerald out and found him to be generous with his time and his insights. He supported my application to Yale Divinity School and launched me on the path to ordained ministry. I was so grateful that he made the trip to my home church in Maryland to preach my ordination sermon in 1986. No doubt he was making such trips for former students across the country, particularly in his much-loved role as a wedding officiant. Within the last ten years, he reached out to me and asked me to ""sponsor"" him as an officiant in Washington, DC. For some reason, DC has that requirement, officiant to officiant. I was happy to do so! It was a small token of my appreciation.I'm also grateful that Gerald sent my daughter a children's book in 1988, the year she was born. Roughly two decades later, Sadie (Trinity '10) was a student in one of his history classes at Duke. We share the special bond of being shaped by a remarkable man, a generation apart.Henry G. Brinton, Trinity '82~~~~~We welcome the Duke community to send additional remembrances to The Chronicle atabigailspiller@dukechronicle.comandopinion@dukechronicle.com."
Costs of college campus economic diversity to democracy? A view from an economics classroom ,Lisa Gennetian,2024-09-26T12:00:00Z,Sep,26,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092624-gennetian-economics-classroom-democracy-20240926.html,"In September 2023, David Leonhardt wrote an opinion piece provocatively headlined “Why Does Duke Have So Few Low-Income Students?"" with images of graduation paraphernalia like mortar boards and diplomas covered in $100 bills. Based on the article’s analysis, Duke ranked 12th of the elite universities in the proportion of students with Pell Grants; Harvard ranked first, with Columbia, MIT and Yale closely behind. Though 12th in economic diversity, Leonhardt also notes that 40% of Duke’s students are students of color and 10% from overseas; this demographic puzzle of low economic diversity yet high racial, ethnic and global diversity is tucked into the context of Duke’s $12 billion endowment (ranked 13th of top 20 universities).Leonhardt personalizes the piece featuring the stories of two students who reflect on introductions to luxury brands such as Canada Goose, luxury vacations in exotic places and the ease by which students impulsively enjoy trips to experience things like Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Merit scholarships are criticized for subsidizing high-income students. Sushi in Duke’s main dining hall is held up as an example of expensive guilty pleasures (versus sustenance). The article ends with an implicit and kind apology from Dean Gary Bennett, who, applying tools of economics, explains that Duke fell behind in a landscape of fierce competition with demand among post-secondary institutions that exceeded the supply of students with low income. Duke makes for a powerful case study. Duke’s economic diversity looked similar to elite peer institutions a decade ago. Leonhardt moves his analysis forward, raising important normative questions such as: Are students worse off at Duke, with less economic diversity, than peer institutions? Does this affect their worldviews? Their role as citizens? Their obligation to society? And does it affect all of these things in ways that reinforce their privilege? In a twist, at the end of Leonhardt’s piece, Duke students with low income express gratitude for their experiences and how they’ve widened their worldviews. I’d argue that this is the starting place for interrogating tough normative questions: what are the varied ways that students’ worldviews are and can be shaped on college campuses? What better place to reflect on this than in a contemporary undergraduate economics classroom at Duke? A place that Duke students enter with very strong world views on, for example, income inequality (typically ranked as the top social problem in the U.S.) as undermining democracy. Let me demonstrate by bringing you into my applied microeconomics classroom, taught in Duke’s Sanford School of Public Policy. In my teaching module on economic consumer theory, we will turn to questions about housing and public education choices. Duke students have a lot to say about segregation and high housing prices. They also learn some things they didn’t have the tools to previously piece together. For example, while it seems clear that when parents make decisions to enroll their children in private school because it presumably benefits their own children, students also learn that families are still paying for public education through taxes that they are obligated to pay no matter if they have children or whether or not their children attend the districted school. Students learn this and another important feature of public financing through this simple example: that most school districts realize their revenue from property taxes and property taxes are based on home values. This sparks a robust conversation about school quality and who benefits and who does not; students in my classroom who attended private school openly mingle their insights about their views and experiences of school quality with students who attended public school. This sparks yet another thread about the value of homes that contribute to property taxes that fund school budgets that affect school quality. They learn that while the value of a home increases one’s assets (translated to an increase in your budget constraint), it can also price you out of your community if you are to realize that return and sell your home, which also might mean priced out of a high-quality school district. When home values go up, some things get better, e.g., increased revenue from property taxes can go toward funding public goods like schools, parks and libraries, but who benefits? Some people get priced out. This sparks yet another kind of conversation in my economics classroom regarding segregation and discrimination. One year, a student vocally chimed in that prices are not always the objective determinant of value: this student’s mixed-race family staged their home (e.g., removing all photographs of her Black mother) to ensure its monetary value is not judged by racial bias. I ask students to go online and calculate their eligibility for an earned income tax credit. Students punch in the most familiar number they have access to when asked about an annual salary: the annual tuition of a Duke education. They are shocked to realize that their earned income tax credit equals zero. How can it be that the cost of a Duke education does not reflect a salary eligible for a tax credit? This opens the door to a discovery of median household income in the U.S. and at levels of poverty, both of which are way below the cost of a Duke tuition. Some of the deepest and sharpest insights happen at the end of the semester during students’ showcase presentations when students lean into applying economic concepts to make sense of their daily lives at Duke. This includes “the economics of luxury products,” almost always generating uncomfortable pauses and then lively debates about the economic mystery of how an unattractive $2000 sneaker could be so desirable. Students engage in collaborations reflecting wildly different backgrounds: a student from rural Japan working with a student from urban Los Angeles, and together they confront the trade-offs of traffic congestion, availability of public transportation and access to jobs and consumer goods, considering the impact on the climate, and on people’s quality of life. Year to year students in my Duke economics classroom bring their existing world views, experiences and assumptions, and what I see is how these shape into new insights on the “exorbitant pricing strategies of Duke dining,” the “high cost of Duke parking” and the seemingly “rational decisions to participate in Duke Greek social life.” These are not comfort zone conversations, and these conversations are happening in ways that are applying core theorems of economics about the forces and dynamics of allocating scarce resources, equity and who benefits and who does not. Going back to Leonhardt, can elite institutions like Duke do better on all aspects of diversity, including economic diversity? Yes, of course. It’s important to recognize the ways in which we could do better, but also recognize the existing agency and diversity that we do have — and that can be leveraged to foster and facilitate democracy. Classrooms can be set with cultures in which students with low or high or mixed-income, indeed all students, are empowered to push world views. Classrooms — I might argue, especially economics classrooms — can go a long way to interrogate normative perspectives and issues from non-normative tools in all of the ways that a true democracy demands. That’s the good news! Lisa Gennetian is the Pritzker Professor of Early Learning Policy Studies at the Sanford School of Public Policy.

Embracing polyhedronism,Aaron Siegle,2024-09-26T12:00:00Z,Sep,26,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092624-siegle-embracing-polyhedronism-20240926.html,"Are you afraid of the dark?Fear of darkness, or nyctophobia, is now relegated to a cute childhood memory for most of us. But an intrinsic fear of the dark is hard-wired into us humans. After all, we’re not designed to be nocturnal (except for the four brief years of college). Fear of the dark is an evolutionary adaptation that enabled our ancestors to avoid predators and other calamities. A hidden landscape is a dangerous one.Today, we are blessed with a well-lit physical environment. But our social climate is murkier than ever before. Trust is at an all-time low. We seldom know our neighbors, much less talk to them. Our lives on social media are even more fraught. In this way, our assumptions about others are made in darkness, like attempting to discern a shadowy figure in the distance. To see the entirety of a figure, one must closely examine it in the light. A pyramid could be mistaken for a cube or a prism for an octahedron. But all these shapes share one thing in common — they are all polyhedrons.Polyhedrons are 3D solids comprised of polygons that are conjoined at the edges. Polyhedrons are complex, multifaceted entities that come in a variety of flavors despite the geometric constraints on what constitutes a polyhedron. Distinguishing one polyhedron from another takes patience and is the premise of the entire field of polyhedral combinatorics. What if we viewed each other just as we studied polyhedrons?In today’s sociopolitical climate, we group ourselves into binary categories. Are you a Democrat or a Republican? White or Black? Man or woman? Religious or atheist? Based on how you answer these questions, society infers certain attributes about you. The challenge is that people never align neatly into these categories, leading to stereotyping and polarization. We are all intersections of overlapping identities that may not be traditionally associated with each other. As the amount of people we encounter via the internet grows and our attention span simultaneously shrinks, we rely on simple characterizations to process information at the speed demanded by our fast-paced digital environment. Space and time compel us to reduce others into cartoonish versions of themselves. The path out of this spiral, is, naturally, to give ourselves more space and time. The metaphor of a polyhedron is not a new one. In his encyclical ""Fratelli Tutti"" Pope Francis states that a polyhedron is emblematic of “a society where differences coexist, complementing, enriching and reciprocally illuminating one another, even amid disagreements and reservations."" We are not supposed to pretend that our differences have suddenly disappeared, but rather acknowledge the shared human experiences that unite us. But instead of appreciating the humanity of those around us, we too often act like the devices that we are always on — computers. Our modern computing architecture, despite all its complexity, still relies on a binary code of 0s and 1s. Even as servers are developed that process an enormous quantity of 0 and 1s in milliseconds, they still only recognize 0s and 1s — nothing in between. In the same way, we analyze those we encounter with the same dualistic mindset and respond accordingly. The roots of this challenge can be traced back to where our values come from. Many cite the aftermath of the 2016 election as the moment when America became defined by polarization. In response to the election of Donald Trump, liberals began placing ""In this house"" signs in their yards. A conservative version emerged soon thereafter. Regardless of what the signs actually say, they serve as powerful symbols of values diffusion in our society. The signs — and the words on them — are curated and distributed by politicos. Normal people are expected to accept the values distributed to them or else risk severe condemnation. Values are, by definition, things that you believe in and motivate you to get out of bed each morning. Therefore, you should create your own beliefs, not your party. Top-down values creation is what suppresses organic creation of social norms. Original ideas, those developed within the local community, are more likely to help groups overcome their collective challenges. In other words, trickle-down values are just as ineffective as trickle-down economics.These developments are coupled with the rise of partisan schadenfreude in American society. Schadenfreude is when one experiences pleasure derived from the suffering of others. It’s that feeling when the victor is happier about their opponents’ pain in failure than their own joy in winning. While it’s obvious to foresee the deleterious effects of schadenfreude on social capital, what’s less clear is how we got to this point. Part of the answer lies in the constant temptation to define ingroup versus outgroup dynamics. One of the most oft-repeated lines in political communication is ""You are either with us, or against us."" This quote, or variations of it, has been used by a diverse array of public figures — including Cicero, Vladimir Lenin, George Orwell, Mussolini, Hillary Clinton, George Bush, Sarah Palin and Anakin Skywalker. Given that many of these figures lived in liberal democracies in which appealing to the median voters is the objective, villainizing neutrality seems foolish. As a result, polyhedrons, people who prioritize independent thought, get locked out of our social and political systems. Most remedies for partisan polarization focus on strengthening our relationships with those around us. And while these efforts are impactful, they are only effective as the people who participate in them. That’s why civility can’t be restored without widespread personal introspection. In our nonstop information environment, we seldom have the time and wherewithal to reflect on our own existence. Only in these quiet moments can we truly understand that we are polyhedrons — unique creations shaped by a variety of identities and experiences that may contradict societal expectations. And we also become more aware that those around us — whether we agree with them or not — are polyhedrons too.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity junior. His pieces typically run on alternate Fridays."
We only live once: Protecting the sanctity of life,Advikaa Anand,2024-09-25T12:00:00Z,Sep,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092524-anand-only-live-once-20240925.html,"I remember the first time that I saw a friend’s arm in a cast. The tips of her finger were wrapped up in neon pink plaster, its bright color distracting me from the multiplication problems in front of me. During our break, all our classmates flocked to sign her cast, and so did I. I pressed the tip of the sharpie to the plaster’s rough surface, searching for a small space to write something when someone else’s message caught my eye, “You’re so cool!” I decided that I concurred with the sentiment. After all, my friend’s cast was a testament to an adventure, a breathing relic of the daring spirit that propelled her to score the winning goal in her soccer game, albeit at the cost of her ulna. So the next time I tumbled down the stairs, admittedly as a result of my clumsiness rather than daredevilry, I wasted no time sobbing over the aching pain piercing my knee. Instead, I marched through my front door with pride, brandishing my injury to my parents, “Look what I got at school today.”I am not sure when I crossed that grand precipice of wounds and injuries ceasing to serve as emblems of thrill and excitement and instead, causes of fear and worry. I look back to my childish naivete of thinking all physical consequences of my adventures were irrelevant if I had a good story to tell, and I am shocked at my obliviousness. I don’t think we fully comprehend the gravity of only getting one body with which we are to live our entire lives until we are far too old or far too sick. When we are young, we think that we are invincible and so we hurl our bodies into situations of peril without regard for the repercussions. I can think of far too many instances when I have neglected eating on time or forced myself to carry through a school day even while not feeling well.What is far worse is that we scorn fragility. When our peers are not able to maintain the same physical pace as us, we laugh at them and deride them. I remember a conversation a few years ago with a few friends, and our discussion of asthma when we saw that someone had accidentally dropped their inhaler in the hallway. “What a wuss has asthma at nineteen,” he cackled as we walked past him. The lack of compassion in his words pierced me like a blade through my ribs. I know he was kidding, but the sheer ignorance of his words has stayed with me. After all, we cannot spend all our lives sustaining the same vigor we boasted in our youth. To assume that we are immune to the ebbs and flows of life that might render us vulnerable to debilitating illness in the future or even in the present is more than foolish. It is insensitive. And it is myopic. Yet, it is also a hallmark of youth and one for which we cannot entirely fault ourselves. Psychological studies have repeatedly shown that teenagers “simply do not believe that anything truly bad will ever happen to them.” These feelings of “immortality” have their origins in the delayed chemical evolution of our brains: “The reason the frontal lobes are not fully engaged is because they have not yet completed the process of neuronal myelination.” This myelination is essential to providing the insulation that enables electrical signals to reach their neuronal destinations. Although much of this false sense of invincibility is biochemical in nature, not every teenager gets to enjoy it. Some adolescents are forced to reckon with the fragility of their bodies and shed their neuronal inclinations towards invincibility, as they contend with health conditions that impair their ability to eat, walk, and breathe in the same way as their counterparts. What they learn in months takes others decades: we cannot take the proper functioning of our health for granted. And if the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us any lessons, it’s that our bodies are not impervious, and neither is our collective health. None of us exist in a vacuum — the decisions we make have important reverberations for the well-being of others. It takes a second — one accident — for the physical plights we view as distant threats to become our present predicaments. But as we acknowledge the ways in which our innate vulnerability as humans may hinder us, a susceptibility that transcends age and health conditions, we must not forget that this fragility is also a beautiful thing. That we are not immortal at any age means we are also afforded the privilege of feeling deeply throughout our lifetimes — so just as we may struggle with our bodies as much at five as at sixty-five, we may also love and feel with the same intensity. We only live once. But we only live once. And when it’s over, it’s forever. Advikaa Anand is a Trinity junior. Her pieces typically run on alternate Wednesdays."
Comparison is the thief of joy. But why do we do it? And is there a way to avoid imposter syndrome? ,Angarag Gantogoo,2024-09-25T12:00:00Z,Sep,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092524-gantogoo-comparison-thief-of-joy-20240925.html,"""He finished this assignment in an hour! How come it has taken me days to complete this! She looks so pretty in that dress! I wonder why I can’t dress like that everyday..."" Why do we compare ourselves to others? More specifically, why do we do it when it almost never makes us feel better? I mean, there I was, sitting in class, scrolling through the endless achievements of my peers on social media, and suddenly it felt like everything I’d ever done academically wasn’t good enough. The perfect grades, the scholarships, the prestigious internships — they all seemed like they belong to someone else. It’s the classic trap of comparison, and I’m starting to think it’s not even a modern-day problem. Sure, we now have Instagram and LinkedIn to give us constant, curated reminders of how well everyone else is doing, but hasn’t comparison always been a thing? The ancient philosophers probably didn’t have a digital feed, but I bet they still felt a pang of jealousy when their peers were lauded for groundbreaking ideas. So, what is it about human nature that makes us so obsessed with stacking our accomplishments against others? Some people say it’s natural to want to benchmark ourselves, to see how we measure up. After all, it gives us some frame of reference, a way to understand where we lie in the grand scheme of things. But what they don’t often tell you is that this need to compare is one of the fastest ways to feel inadequate — cue imposter syndrome, where even the most accomplished among us feel like frauds waiting to be exposed. We all know the feeling: you land an academic achievement, be it acceptance into a prestigious program or a glowing recommendation from a professor, and instead of basking in the glory, you panic. ""What if they find out I’m not actually that smart?"" you wonder. The irony? The very people you’re comparing yourself to probably feel the same way. Imposter syndrome is like a shadow that follows you around, showing up at the worst possible times. It tells you that your achievements are either a fluke or not nearly as impressive as someone else’s. It convinces you that if you just tried harder, you could finally be “good enough.” The trouble is, there’s always someone ahead of you — someone smarter, more accomplished, more capable. And the more you compare, the further you feel from your own success. So how do we stop? How do we break free from the never-ending loop of comparison and learn to feel proud of our own work without feeling like a fraud? I think it starts with understanding that everyone’s path is different. Just because someone else has reached a certain milestone doesn’t mean you’re behind. Life — and academia — is not a race. It’s more like one of those group projects where everyone plays a different role, and success looks different for everyone involved. And then there’s gratitude. I know, it sounds cliché, but it’s true. When we focus on what we’ve accomplished — what we’ve learned, who we’ve become — we start to realize that our journey is valuable in its own right. Your GPA might not be perfect, but maybe you’ve gained insight into what truly interests you. Maybe you’ve struggled through a tough course and come out stronger for it. That’s worth celebrating. Lastly, surround yourself with people who remind you of your worth, people who see your accomplishments for what they are — yours. It’s easier to silence imposter syndrome when you have a community who encourages you, not a stream of comparison constantly reminding you of how far you think you have to go. In the end, maybe we’ll never fully stop comparing ourselves to others — it’s human nature, after all. But we can choose to shift our focus. We can remind ourselves that someone else’s success doesn’t diminish our own. So the next time you feel the itch of comparison or the sting of imposter syndrome, just remember: you’re not an imposter. You’re exactly where you’re meant to be.

It’s time to accept weed ,Ethan Khorana,2024-09-24T12:00:00Z,Sep,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092424-khorana-time-to-accept-weed-20240924.html,"Editor's note: This article mentions substance use and overdose.The first funeral I ever attended was about a month before I started at Duke. It was the middle of the night when I found out my friend had died. I was driving home, and the illuminated fast food and gas station signs flashed against my car windows. My phone started to ring, and I saw my friend Dell’s name appear on my CarPlay screen. I answered the call and from the way Dell said my name when he answered the phone I knew something was wrong. An entire list of all the people who could have been hurt appeared in my head. “Bro, Elijah died,” Dell said. It felt like time slowed down, and I froze. I texted Elijah’s cousin who told me that they had found him dead in his house. It wasn’t until three days later that I found out he died of an overdose because someone laced his weed with what we believe was fentanyl. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 100 times stronger than morphine and can be extremely lethal if not dosed properly. Due to its highly addictive nature, drug dealers will lace weed with the narcotic to entice consumers. However, drug dealers are not trained to microdose fentanyl, which is why people can have severe reactions when consuming laced weed. This is not uncommon: just this year in May on a Monday night in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, three people overdosed on weed laced with fentanyl. I remember talking to my dad after my friend's death and his saying “It really is a sad situation, he didn’t do anything wrong, and the parents didn’t do anything wrong”. The truth of this sentiment stuck with me. In a small funeral home, on the east side of Cleveland, I watched a pastor and funeral home assistant shut the casket of my eighteen-year-old friend; he did nothing wrong, and, more so, he did nothing out of the ordinary. Three out of every ten high school seniors smoke weed and it is now acknowledged that weed is substantially better for you than other addictive substances like alcohol. This is why the narrative must be changed around the legalization of weed. Elijah bought weed from a drug dealer only a couple of weeks before weed became legalized in Ohio. Legalization brings safeguards for consumption and an elimination of the risk of weed being laced with illegal substances. However, a bill currently stands in the North Carolina House of Representatives that would effectively ban weed from being legalized in the future — even if it is legalized on the federal level. The banning of weed will not stop North Carolinians from consuming marijuana but will ensure that they consume it with no safeguards or regulation. The bill should be rejected again in the next house session, as it was at the start of the year, and should be vetoed if ever passed to ensure that no life is ended too early from laced weed. There is one more thing that could have saved my friend's life, and it hangs in every dorm room on Duke’s campus locked in a small box. Narcan is an antidote administered to those experiencing an overdose that will block symptoms of opioids for up to 90 minutes. Duke University puts Narcan in every dorm as a safety precaution; however, the boxes containing Narcan are ziplocked. When overdosing on fentanyl, people have minutes before their lungs shut down, and they are unable to breathe. The time it would take to cut the zip lock and open the box of Narcan could be detrimental to a Duke student who may be experiencing an overdose. It is time that Duke University cut ties with the zip locks and help ensure that no students at Duke University have to see their classmates in a coffin. Ethan Khorana is a Trinity first-year.

Leaked document outlines extreme student voting incentives,Monday Monday,2024-09-24T12:00:00Z,Sep,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092424-monday-monday-extreme-voting-incentives-20240924.html,"In a shocking breach of multifactor authentication, a confidential document outlining the university's plans to boost student voter turnout has been leaked on X, formerly known as Twitter. The document, apparently intended for release by the University’s President via flyers in Krafthouse, explains a voting initiative Duke is implementing starting in mid-October.The main incentive will be a 1% tuition discount for every student who votes. When approached for comment, Duke's Vice Provost for Student Affairs, who wished to remain anonymous, said, ""Look, we're already spending an average of 20 students' tuition on constantly resodding the quad grass. And Duke Athletics pays students hundreds of dollars to come to their football games, so what's another million in the name of democracy?"" Students who vote will also earn a second prize to help their stomachs after helping their country: “I Voted” stickers are worth 50 food points. Finally, here is a way to get dessert in The Commons without lying that it is someone’s birthday.In addition, the document outlines a list of prizes students can get for referring students to vote. The referral is logged by entering the student’s Unique ID. If they get five other students to vote, they’ll be entered into a raffle to earn a coveted spot in Miracle Lot. An electric fence surrounded by barbed wire will be put around the parking spot to keep Bird scooters away.If they get twenty other students, they will be entered into a raffle to rename Cameron Indoor Stadium. The University’s President predicts that a top contender will be “Scheyer’s Erotica XPalace” after a Psych 101 survey found that the number one place for students to find a hookup is with the person they’re accidentally grinding on when “we jump on defense.” However, it also warns that all students who don’t vote will be forced to take a new T-Req course: Patriotism 101. This class has traditionally only been seen in the SEC. Student reactions have been mixed. Sophomore Math major Rachel Adams groaned at the news. “I can barely stay awake in my current classes. If I wanted to learn about the origin of eagles in the United States, I would’ve gone to Boston College.” Self-proclaimed party animal Junior Kyle Brooks III gushed, “1% tuition discount, that’s like, what, 500 bucks? That can pay for a few more kegs for Waynestock!”The document includes details on a 'Great Patriotism Contest.' Students who demonstrate the most patriotic spirit (goodbye, Cameron Crazies, hello, Voting Vixens) through activities like hanging up a range of flags – from Confederate to Pride – will earn one food point per flag. The University’s President also notes that in an attempt to breach bipartisanship, only whole milk will be available in the dining halls, as soy milk has been deemed too divisive. It concludes with a cryptic message: ""Finally, imagine: do you want a packed election night Shooters to be Charli XCX brat-coded, or would you prefer dry-humping a stranger while the leaked Project 2025 videos play on a loop?"" When pressed for clarification on what the British singer has to do with an American election, the visibly confused University President muttered something about ""those darn dancing TikToks"" before hurriedly ending the interview.As the Duke community grapples with the content of this leaked document, one thing is clear: democracy has never looked so lucrative. International and underage students can be heard already practicing their eagle calls for the first Patriotism 101 midterm. But in all seriousness, Vote, Vote, Vote. Election day is on November 5th. Show them we can rig the system by getting the free Locopops they hand out outside of Karsh after you vote. Let's do the damn thing and win this election. Monday Monday wants to remind students that voting more than once for extra Locopops is illegal in most states. They heavily recommend that students wait for a free popsicle on LDOC instead. "
How “free” misleads us,Anna Garziera,2024-09-24T12:00:00Z,Sep,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092424-garziera-free-misleads-20240924.html,"Costanza et al. wrote a paper in 1997 titled “The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital” in which they dared to do the impossible: put a monetary value on all that nature provides us. Reading this influential paper for my Environmental Policy 102 class got me thinking: What else are we given that we take for granted?The more I thought about it, the more the answer became clear: lots of things. From the necessities that we are provided with from birth to the kind words said by our loved ones at our funeral, most of what is valuable in life we receive by the grace of others.The least we can do is be grateful for it.Mother Nature is one of the most overlooked givers. Last July, I discovered a secret gem in my garden: the modest boughs of a young crape myrtle. More importantly, I discovered how much I preferred being outside. For me, there is nothing more relaxing than reading under the shade of a tree. Americans collectively spend billions of dollars on dream vacations every year. Think of how many cruise trips we embark on. How many “calming” SPA massages we pay for. How many fragrance oil diffusers we buy, leaving our rooms smelling like lavender. Lavender is a relaxing scent, I admit. But so is the smell of freshly cut grass on a sunny afternoon. Perhaps, a lot of us would feel fulfilled by the latter, if we only gave it a try.It’s no news that nature is good for us. We embellish our spaces with it, we advocate to protect it, and yet we still, as a generation, resist spending time in it. Spending time in nature has been proven to improve our physical and mental wellbeing time and time again. But we’ve still been ignoring the elemental lesson — our parents were right. Go play outdoors. Costanza et al. wrote that paper to convince policymakers of the importance of conserving our natural environments. They argued that we destroy natural ecosystems because we don’t realize their value to our economy. Now, we’re realizing we don’t spend nearly enough time outside for what good it would do to us, and yet it’s free. Perhaps because it is free.You know what else is free? Public libraries. I bet you’ve heard this said a million times. Public libraries are a resource that is generally underused for what unbounded amounts of good it would do us as a society — we don’t read enough books. We want better empathy, higher literacy rates, improved standardized testing scores, creativity, innovation. Reading would improve our competency in all of the above — but we don’t want to read.Reading would also do us Duke students a lot of good individually. From reduced stress, to better sleep, to improved imagination, reading is a cure-all. Much like spending time in nature, it’s difficult to adopt this habit and not reap its benefits.But we still seem unconvinced. Most of the use gotten out of public libraries is by the same few regular bookworms.College campus libraries are made so accessible that inevitably some students use them to their full potential. Think of how Perkins noticeably fills up during finals season. But most students ignore their intended use. Except for a cozy study spot, our campus libraries’ intended purpose as banquets of knowledge is entirely forgotten.One free and beneficial resource that Duke students make good use of is the C1 bus: direct transportation between our two campuses — East and West — on an electric vehicle that only partially shakes the sanity out of its passengers with its violent sways. But Duke essentially removed all other options for East campus residents. Walking takes too long to make it on time to class. There’s no bike lane. There are close to no parking options on West. Cars don’t even have access to Chapel Drive. So we take the bus. But isn’t it weird? If freshmen could drive to West and park there for free, the C1 would become a ghost bus. And yet it'd be more convenient than facing morning traffic. And yet it’s free.The hardest thing to realize is that someone's underappreciating our presence in their life. While the C1 bus won’t be offended if students stop making use of its services, we immediately notice if our friends don’t match our investment in the friendship. We question why we’re always the ones to text first. Growing up, we start to realize that the most valuable thing we have is our time. We allocate each hour carefully amongst our interests — our classes, our clubs, our loved ones — and maybe a couple to sleep each night. Our time is scarce, and we cherish it.Yet it's so easy to underestimate the value of someone else waiting for our class to end to go to dinner together. From our point of view, waiting for us costs them nothing. But we know the value of our time — it’s gold. We just don’t realize others must feel the same way.And it’s not just the living time of those around us. It’s also the time of the geniuses, architects and artists of the past, who gave up their lives to enable us to live as we do today. After reading ""East of Eden"" this summer, I remember feeling so grateful for old Steinbeck, whose work he did in the 1950s gave me — and so many around me — such pleasure today. The awards he received for his novel at the time might have been mighty. But compared to how many American Literature classrooms he encaptivated, how many minds he opened, he was undoubtedly undercompensated. He might as well have done the work for free. Most artists do. Even now famous pieces — The Starry Night, Girl with a Pearl Earring, Impression, Sunrise — were hardly worth a penny when they were first finished.Through the books he left us, I can indulge in Steinbeck’s illuminating ideas “for free.” It only costs me the time it takes to read the book. It cost Steinbeck his lifetime. “But books aren’t fr—” Stop. Stop right there. Go back and read my previous point about public libraries.My Econ 101 professor used to openly criticize the pass/fail system of the class during lectures. He thought that fulfilling requirements for the class was too easy — he called it the “pass/pass” system. This effort to lower the barriers to entry for the Economics major here at Duke failed to make me realize just what I had been given: a golden opportunity. For once, higher education became what it should be all about — learning for its own sake. Yet that “free” opportunity slipped right by me. Instead of wanting to learn, I wondered what I was doing, sitting through those lectures. I took regular breaks in the middle of class to go to the bathroom and roam the halls.I can now see that my attitude was all wrong: Instead of seeing the class as a free break, I should have leaned into attending lectures just to learn. I should have cherished simply listening to the professor without the need to frantically take notes or worry about what I must learn for the final exam. Learn from my mistake: Don’t get caught in the trap. Just because something is free to you doesn't mean it isn't valuable. Don’t underestimate what you are given.Because, just like that, you’ll wake up one day and there'll be no free bus that takes you from home to work every day. There’ll be no one that cleans your bathroom for you. Things will change and you will lose a friend and you will find yourself wishing you had been more thankful for the time they gave up for you. That's the bummer about ""free"" things — they’re invisible. You don't realize you have them until they're gone.Anna Garziera is a Trinity sophomore. Her pieces typically run on alternate Tuesdays."
Dialogue and the Divine,Luke A. Powery,2024-09-23T12:15:00Z,Sep,23,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092324-powery-dialogue-divine-20240923.html,"As I reflect on last week’s Provost Forum focused on “Universities and the Israel-Palestine Conflict: How to Discuss, How to Engage?” and enter this week of the Centennial Founders’ and Homecoming celebrations, I am reminded of the founding of Duke University in 1924, including our institution’s guiding documents. “Article I: Aims” of the university bylaws speaks of how Duke “is committed to creating a rigorous scholarly community characterized by generous hospitality toward diverse religious and cultural traditions” and strives “to promote a respectful spirit of dialogue and understanding; to discourage all partisan and sectarian strife….” How relevant are these aims for the time in which we live!The panel of Duke faculty and staff, for which I served as moderator, discussed the topic “dialogue and discourse amidst differences.” The panelists were the embodiment of Duke’s aims as a teaching and learning community. They were respectful, thoughtful, insightful and dialogical, while possessing a sense of intellectual humility and desire for further understanding. It revealed that discussions do not have to demonize but rather it is possible to engage in humanizing discourse. It was fitting that this panel occurred during the Centennial year because it demonstrated what Duke aims to be as an institution. I walked away inspired to continue in this “spirit of dialogue and understanding.”Beyond the institutional, there is something theological about dialogue as well. In the Gospel of Luke, chapter 24, two disciples of Jesus, as they walk to the village Emmaus, are distraught over the death of Jesus and his body having gone missing from the tomb. They’re questioning, wondering, and uncertain, but they are in dialogue. They don’t understand what has happened and are grappling with those realities and their implications. It’s helpful to notice that as they engage in dialogue, that is when the resurrected Jesus appears among them. The ancient scripture says, “While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near….” In genuine open dialogue and conversation, the Divine can manifest. Dialogue is not only a sociological phenomenon; it is a spiritual one. Conversation can be an invocation for the Holy. There is a similar concept in Judaism that I learned about from my colleague Rabbi Elana Friedman during the recent panel discussion. It is called “argument for the sake of Heaven.” The gist of it is that people can debate for destructive purposes such as gaining power or humiliating an adversary or for good purposes, such as to better understand what is true or right — that is, for the sake of Heaven. The late English Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks explains, “‘Argument for the sake of Heaven’ is one of Judaism’s noblest ideals – conflict resolution by honouring both sides and employing humility in the pursuit of truth.”In the current time of tense political, social, cultural and religious polarization, I encourage you to “argue for the sake of Heaven.” Don’t be afraid to learn from the other, whoever they may be, because they, too, are human, and by engaging their humanness you may encounter holiness.During the COVID pandemic, I wrote a poem called “Space”: Pandemics. Social Distance. We are far away From each other Yet Launch into space Far away At distance. Closer to technology Than one another. Technology Outpacing Our humanity. We like distances. Far away ones. Go to space and Not make space For each other. This is Pandemonium. It is truly pandemonium — a word reserved for the name of the capital of hell in John Milton’s epic poem ""Paradise Lost"" — when we eschew, ignore or hate other human beings and are unwilling to dialogue. To avoid pandemonium, why not embrace Duke’s bylaws and live into the “spirit of dialogue and understanding” and “discourage all partisan and sectarian strife”? This is a part of Duke’s culture that challenges us to not only “go to space” but to “make space for each other.” What the bylaws don’t say but I will, is that when we make space for one another in dialogue, we may be pleasantly surprised that we are also making space for God.The Rev.

Overcoming addiction,Arya Krishnan,2024-09-23T12:00:00Z,Sep,23,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092324-krishnan-overcoming-addiction-20240923.html,"Editor's note: This article discusses substance use and addiction. My go-to breakfast was a small cappuccino, a bowl or two of weed and a generous number of vape hits.At the time, it felt like the perfect start to the day. It got me energized, motivated and wired-in, ready to face whatever the day had ahead. Despite the inevitable annihilation of my gut health and endocrine system, there were other issues at hand. That bowl or two of weed for breakfast became a bowl or two for lunch and dinner. That devolved into me sessions in between meals. Eventually, all this descended into pure chaos where I was hitting weed or nicotine every chance I could. And that wasn’t even the main problem. Like the now non-existent dodo bird, I similarly obliterated my high into extinction. Long gone were the days of calm, euphoria and that tasteful altered state of consciousness. No matter how much or how frequently I stimulated myself, I pretty much felt the exact same. I was devastatingly paralyzed. It was like tasting a buffet of the heavens and then suddenly losing all my taste buds before I could go back for seconds. Instead of doing the logical thing — taking a break and building a more responsible relationship with intoxicants and stimulants — I doubled down and desperately sought after that high. I experienced it before so I can and will experience it again, I told myself. Hour after hour, day after day, I kept trying to get high, to no avail. I was falling further into a deep abyss. “The best way to overcome an addiction is by getting addicted to something else.” Right? Well, kind of...I took inspiration from Beethoven. Plagued by deep mental health troubles, trauma, alcoholism and deafness, he took refuge in music. He proclaimed he would live for his art and his art only, and then went on to become the undisputed GOAT of music (yes, I said undisputed). So, with that in mind, in not nearly as dramatic a fashion, I followed suit and got into music. This was a transformative period where I fell in love with and immersed myself in the art and craft of music making. Channeling that energy and craving into art actually filled me with a higher sense of joy and euphoria — the feelings that drugs weren’t giving me anymore. I also made attempts to focus and work on my health, by incorporating more sports, gym training and yoga into my daily life. So, indeed getting “addicted” to something that is more healthy, fulfilling and productive for myself was a great way to overcome “lower” addictions. But there’s a catch: I’m an idiot. Instead of replacing my drug addiction with a more productive passion, I ended up combining the two. My new hobbies became the perfect stadium to host and foster my drug use. I used drugs to fuel my musical-making process, and I got hooked on the sensation of working out when high. Furthermore, I was starting to develop a mentally unhealthy relationship with my passions; I excessively strived for new heights and was disheartened when that didn’t happen, and also became dependent on them for my daily happiness. New addictions weren’t working, and this made me realize that the problem wasn’t what I did or didn’t do. There’s something deeper underlying this whole issue: my personal and strictly internal sense of well-being. All the posters say happiness comes from within, and I had experienced this the hard way. I committed myself to working on myself, which found expression in the development of meditation practice. This was initially challenging: It was impossible to keep my mind from distractions, and I’d quickly get anxious. Despite these hurdles, I stayed consistent as I felt immediate improvements in both focus and calmness. I progressively increased the duration of my meditations, and started experimenting with different forms of the practice. I dove deep into simple practices such as breath work and silent contemplation, as well as explorative practices such as creative visualizations and chanting “mantras” (a string of sound believed to encapsulate beneficial energies). The result? A high that drugs could never rival. A high without a low, which filled me with peace and bliss. In the ancient yogic tradition, they believe the body is the ultimate machine that can produce all the chemicals we may want or need. With modern science, studies have shown that not only are endorphins released in meditation, but eventually your brain functioning itself changes. What’s more, DMT, a psychedelic compound famously dubbed the “spirit molecule,” is also produced in the human brain. No matter your goals, be it wellness, improving mental cognition or a deeper spiritual connection, I believe meditation is a practice everyone can benefit from. If you’re stuck on how to start, I would try this: Sit in a quiet place, close your eyes, and slow and deepen your breathing. Try to exhale twice as long as you inhale. The slowness and the inhale-exhale ratio relax your entire system and calm the mind. Naturally, your mind will wander into thoughts; just gently take it back to your rhythmic breathing. I also like to visualize beautiful things in my heart area such as a red lotus or an orb of golden light. You may not be inclined towards meditation, and that’s okay as well. Activities such as running or singing, just to name a few, produce these same effects. Inner wellness is a personal exploration which need not be confined to one practice or the other. With a bit of time, a lot of discipline and a sheer love of mindfulness practice, I saw all my toxic habits and external dependencies naturally fall away. For me, meditation, music and working out gave me the outlets I needed to work through my addiction. You may be neither addicted nor into meditation, but whatever may be holding you back emotionally and mentally — with a little time and effort — will give way to a healthier and more joyous life.

"What are we, anyway?",Umang Dhingra,2024-09-23T12:00:00Z,Sep,23,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092324-dhingra-what-are-we-anyway-20240923.html,"For the first month after the new semester starts, my calendar is typically decked out for every meal — plans with friends I haven’t seen in a while and dinners with professors I have to catch up with, brunches with clubs and girls’ nights. A month filled with, “Tell me about your summer,” “Do you think you know what you’re doing after college?” and “Where are you staying this year?” And just as quickly as the calendar fills up, it dwindles. Lunches turn into quick conversations in the hallway and dinners morph into waving at WU. It’s understandable: life gets hectic, priorities change, and the weight of classes and extracurriculars begins to hang heavy. Maintaining friendships gets more and more buried on the to-do list. Most people I talk to on campus are knowledgeable, kind and wonderful — how do I decide which friendships to invest in? Which ones will last when I graduate? Who do I want to see at the ten-year reunion, and who do I want to see over Christmas break? College and, by extension, the relationships it brings, is intrinsically ephemeral. In the grand scheme of things, these four years stand out as a space of liminality, of constant and pervasive change. Like few other experiences in life, when you are in college, there is an inevitable end always in sight, amidst all-nighters, parties and crises of faith. You hope that the learning, the memories and the friendships linger past graduation day, but you can’t know that they will. To wonder if any of this means anything, then, is natural. As sad as it is to consider that these relationships may dwindle over time, it doesn’t reduce their value in the present. Any level of belonging and comfort that we are offered leaves an indelible mark on us. My signature still looks like the one my sixth-grade best friend and I drew as a joke at the back of our notebooks. I haven’t spoken in years to the boy who introduced me to my favorite singer. A colleague I didn’t know before this summer has forever changed my makeup game with her fantastic (and ferociously gate-kept) mascara hack. To reduce the value of friendships to whether they last a lifetime is ultimately a myopic view. Love, irrespective of how present it is in our lives, is never not valuable. It leaves us as different, more nuanced people than we were before. To be vulnerable and forgiving might be rewarded in the form of a lifelong friendship, but it ultimately means something bigger — it shows us we are capable of fostering relationships with others, things that connect us to our own humanness. I don’t mean to say one should be impetuous with the people they choose to spend time with or lean towards having very many surface-level friendships over sharing deeper connections. All I mean is the question of which friendships to invest in based purely on whether they will stay beyond school is moot. Irrespective of how many promises you make right now, life is far too elusive to guarantee permanence. To demand a “forever” from every relationship that means something to us right now is naive. Our best of intentions disappear with age, replaced by priorities, practicality and logic — I know my middle-school self is disappointed in me for spending my 20s as a student at Duke and not a lovelorn artist wandering the streets of Rome. When faced with the reality that none of our friendships here have temporal permanence baked into them, we must contend with their value that has nothing to do with time. It has to do with everything we add to each other’s lives right now. I have been at Duke for a little over two years now, and I am a completely different, better person than I was when I came in — it is no small part because of the kindness, the warmth and the support of the people I was surrounded by. The value in our friendships comes from the impact we let it have on us and what we offer in turn for it. No one knows who we will become, to each other or otherwise, when we leave this university. Will I be someone you call to tell all the crazy things you do in your 20s, or simply be someone who finds out about them through social media? What we do have is now. We have our silly WU dinners and people to wave at in the main quad, professors to catch up with and girls’ nights. Just for right now, I hope you don’t wonder, “what are we, anyway?” I hope you allow yourself to love and care for people, intensely and unapologetically, without wondering if you are bound to lose them. I hope, at least for these four years, you take space in other people’s lives and let them take space in yours. The clock is ticking anyway. Don’t let the chance to be brave — or better yet, to be human — pass you by. Umang Dhingra is a Trinity junior. Her pieces typically run on alternative Mondays. "
The cost of silence: The erosion of freedom of speech in Venezuela,Barbara Cardenas,2024-09-20T12:00:00Z,Sep,20,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092024-cardenas-cost-of-silence-20240920.html,"I was in Miami, watching my country unravel from afar. The Venezuelan presidential elections had just taken place, and everyone knew that Nicolás Maduro had lost. As late dictator Hugo Chávez’s handpicked successor, Maduro has remained in power for years, clinging to his position through multiple fraudulent elections. This time, Edmundo Gonzalez and María Corina Machado, opposition leaders representing a united front for democracy, swept the votes. It was a moment that could have marked a turning point for Venezuela, a victory for democracy after decades of corruption. Instead, we watched in disbelief as Maduro shamelessly declared himself the winner, manipulating the results and disregarding the people's will. The election was stolen, with allegations of fraud, voting manipulation and control of the National Electoral Council (CNE) by pro-Maduro forces. From thousands of kilometers away, I felt utterly powerless.My parents were back in Caracas, voting, doing everything in their power to make a difference, while I was stuck in Florida, unable to cast my ballot. Then the protests began. I watched as my people took to the streets, demanding that our voices be heard. This time, unlike all the times before, María Corina Machado isn’t calling for chaos in the streets. For the first time in years, it feels like there is a plan — something organized and strategic. The fight is ongoing.For 25 years, my brothers and sisters have protested against this government. Hugo Chávez, the man who led Venezuela into authoritarianism, wrongfully came back to power in 2002 after briefly being ousted during a coup. Despite a temporary removal, Chávez reclaimed his presidency through manipulation and military backing, solidifying his control over the country. From that moment on, the Venezuelan people’s fight for freedom intensified. In 2004, 2007, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2019 and now again in 2024, we have taken to the streets, demanding change. Year after year, we’ve watched our freedoms — such as the freedom for laymen and journalists to speak openly, to protest without fear and to vote in free and fair elections — slip away under the grip of Chávez and, now, his successor, Nicolás Maduro.What’s different about this election is that everyone voted. The slums of Petare, a region long known for its loyalty to Chavismo, voted overwhelmingly for Edmundo. The poorest Venezuelans in rural regions, those who have traditionally supported Maduro, finally rejected him.Machado and her team didn’t leave it to chance. They spent months preparing for this moment, organizing a network across the country to ensure that we could prove the truth about who won. Thousands of volunteers — los comanditos — were trained to gather and transmit the voting records (actas) directly from polling stations, working alongside tech experts abroad who designed platforms to handle the incoming data. This immense effort allowed them to gather undeniable proof of our victory, despite the government’s attempt to silence us once again. María Corina’s strategy ensured that the world could see what we’ve known all along: Venezuela voted for change.But now, the government’s assault on freedom of speech has intensified in terrifying ways. They created an app that allowed Chavistas to report their neighbors if they suspected them of being opposition members. The app was quickly taken down, but the damage was done. The message was clear: speak out, and we’ll find you, we’ll silence you.One of my friend’s friend’s family members, a 22-year-old, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. His crime? Having photos from a protest on his phone. Twenty-five years for documenting the truth. Children as young as 13 are being sentenced to years behind bars for protesting. The government doesn’t just want to silence us; they want to break us, to strip us of hope.Every protest is a risk. Every post on social media could be a death sentence.In the United States, people often take their freedom of speech for granted. They can criticize their government, protest in the streets, and voice their opinions without fear of being thrown in prison. They can gather in public squares, wave signs and challenge those in power without disappearing into a jail cell for decades. But in Venezuela, the stakes are different. The price of dissent can be your freedom, your family’s safety or your life. We live in constant fear, but we refuse to stay silent.When I talk to people in the U.S., I realize how often they don’t understand what’s at stake when freedom of speech is eroded. In Venezuela, we’ve watched it disappear over nearly three decades. And once it’s gone, getting it back feels insurmountable. The government wants us to be afraid, to stop posting, to stop speaking. But we can’t, and we won’t.Edmundo Gonzalez, who should be celebrating victory, had to flee to Spain because he couldn’t stay in Venezuela safely. María Corina Machado remains in Venezuela, still fighting. Her bravery gives us hope — hope that one day, our country will be free again. We won the election. We will claim our country. But it’s going to take more than protests — it’s going to take international support.The tactics used in Venezuela mirror those of dictatorships throughout history. Imprisoning political opponents, silencing dissent, controlling the narrative — it’s the same playbook used by the most oppressive regimes, from Nazi Germany to Stalinist Russia. The world has seen these tactics before and should recognize them for what they are: a terrifying threat to freedom and democracy.And while we fight, we are facing an exodus like never before. Over 7 million Venezuelans have fled, seeking safety abroad. We’ve left behind homes, families and our country in search of a future. I am one of the millions living outside my homeland, watching from afar as my countrymen continue the fight. But we haven’t left our love for Venezuela behind. No matter where we are, we feel the pain. That’s why we speak out.As a Venezuelan outside of my country, I feel a deep responsibility to speak out and to educate those around me. Freedom of speech can disappear in the blink of an eye. In Venezuela, we’ve learned the hard way that once it’s gone, getting it back isn’t just a fight — it’s a war.I believe in my country. I believe in the power of my people. We will rise again.We’re smarter this time. We’re angrier this time. We’re more organized, and we know that the battle for freedom doesn’t end in the streets. It ends with reclaiming our voices, our country and our right to speak without fear.We need the world to stand with us and to help us win this fight. Because this isn’t just about Venezuela — it’s about the future of freedom everywhere.Barbara Cardenas is a Trinity senior. Her pieces typically run on alternating Fridays."
The WSJ’s new college rankings are a joke. Maybe that’s the point. ,Leo Goldberg,2024-09-20T12:00:00Z,Sep,20,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/092024-goldberg-wsj-college-rankings-20240920.html,"Last week, the Wall Street Journal released their annual list of the best colleges in the US for 2025, and it is, put mildly, a bewildering mess. Reading it feels as though the world has turned upside down, with conventionally highly esteemed universities taking the back seat to lesser-known schools. Right off the bat with the list, objectively prestigious universities like MIT (6th), Harvard (7th), and the University of Pennsylvania (13th) have ranked after WSJ’s #2 pick of… Babson College? If you find yourself scratching your head and asking, what exactly is a Babson, you’re not alone, I did the same thing. Babson College is a small, selective business school outside of Boston. It offers one of the nation’s top entrepreneurship programs, and while I’m sure it offers wonderful opportunities and experiences to its students, ranking it above Ivy League schools is certainly a stretch. Bizarre upsets like this continue as you go down the list. At #5 is Claremont McKenna, also surpassing Harvard and MIT. Spots 10 and 11 go to Davidson College and Bentley University respectively, San Jose State University takes #16, and UC Merced occupies #18. For perspective, UCLA isn’t found until 50 spots later, at #68. Again, I have no doubt that these schools are fantastic in their own right, but claiming them to be superior to schools which are renowned not just nationally, but globally, is simply not making contact with reality. Perhaps even more shocking is the lower rankings of universities that are generally reputed to be some of the best in the country. Brown University comes in at #36, Vanderbilt at #44, Dartmouth at #57, Northwestern at #62, University of Chicago at #75 and Johns Hopkins at #92. The WSJ also made the mistake of ranking Duke as #45, thus incurring my wrath and providing the impetus for writing this article. Of course, this is all highly subjective, and therefore criticizing the WSJ’s quantifying methodology on a matter of personal opinion doesn’t hold up. However, a key characteristic of the rankings, which dampen their credibility, is the erratic fluctuations of many colleges from just last year. Vanderbilt, for example, dropped 31 spots, from 13th in 2024 to 44th in 2025. The University of Florida went from the #1 ranked public university in 2024, to #34 in 2025. Other schools like Brigham Young dropped 43 spots from 20th to 63rd, and UVA shot up a whopping 51 spots from 84th to 33rd. Now, it’s normal to see some year-to-year fluctuation in college rankings as new data comes in and other factors are taken into account, but certainly not to the extent seen in the WSJ. New data or revelations about current statistics would have to be produced to assert that a university had improved or declined so drastically, such as when Columbia’s ranking dropped suddenly in the US News and Report in 2022 as discoveries were made of the university fudging numbers. The WSJ, however, has schools sliding up and down the rankings seemingly on a whim over a 1-year period at a level that can only be described as capricious. So, what does this all mean? The WSJ’s recent publishing is part of a larger national movement to redefine the notion of what constitutes a “good school,” shifting away from elite universities and focusing instead on other institutions. Protests over the war in Gaza and abundant charges of anti-semitism in top universities last school year caused many to call for a reconsideration of the esteem held for traditionally elite colleges. Put another way, the Ivies are canceled. So much so that a new tier of schools called the “New Ivies ” was created to propose an alternative to the conventionally accepted best schools in America. Top schools are even losing currency as the producers of the most coveted employees, one of their most appealing aspects. Numerous schools have for some time been able to offer roughly the same academic experience as elite colleges, but the brand name of the Ivy League was at least supposed to carry some weight in the job market. Now, that doesn’t even offer much of an advantage, as employers are increasingly looking outside of the Ivies for their workforce. With stereotypical “top schools” purportedly no longer on top, and alternative college quantifiers overcompensating for this by overstating the value of their alternative institutions, do college rankings even matter anymore? And therein perhaps lies the point of the WSJ’s 2025 College Rankings list: the list satirizes the whole idea of college rankings itself, an endeavor which is self-evidently absurd. If we take anything away from the WSJ’s rankings, it’s that the act of quantifying schools competitively against one another is silly and trivial, because, in reality, every school has something to offer. Even if Babson College isn’t actually better than, say, Harvard, the fact that a source as colossal as the WSJ recognizes it as such puts the relativity of such a system into perspective. Next week, US News and World Report will release their highly acclaimed rankings, and as high-school seniors once again undergo the distressing college application process, I would advise them to take these lists with a grain of salt. It’s easy to get caught up in the frenzy of the top 10, but even the idea of the top 10 is rapidly evolving, let alone which schools comprise it. In an environment of higher education that is as volatile as the one we’re currently living in, don’t bank on an exclusive bracket of schools culled from dogmatic rankings lists. Choose a school that truly feels like you, and remember, regardless of rankings, you will end up somewhere great.Leo Goldberg is a Trinity first-year."
"New to the game? No experience, no problem",Valentina Garbelotto,2024-09-19T12:00:00Z,Sep,19,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/091924-garbelotto-new-to-the-game-20240919.html,"When I first heard upperclassmen talk about the dreaded “sophomore slump,” I dismissed it as just another college myth. Freshman year had been a whirlwind of newfound independence and a growing sense of belonging. I felt fully settled into life at Duke, homesickness barely crossing my mind. I was sure I’d breeze through my second year just as smoothly. But the transition from East to West Campus wasn’t just a change of scenery. The slump was real and I never saw it coming. A full-time internship that summer left me overworked and burnt out. As a result, the beginning of my sophomore year hit me hard. I couldn’t leave my dorm without my heart rate spiking and my hands becoming pools of sweat. My anxiety was at an all-time high. I felt overwhelmed by the sights and smells of WU, the lights in Perkins and the expansiveness of lecture halls, even when they were half empty. The honeymoon of new experiences was officially over, and I felt the looming pressures of major declarations, extracurriculars, internship deadlines and summer housing. I felt confined by the four walls of my room, yet I couldn’t leave it. It had become my study space, my dining hall. Anything that brought me out of my dorm and disrupted my routine sent me reeling. It was mid-November when I finally called my mom near tears, telling her I wanted — no, needed — to change my flight to an earlier one so I could get home faster. I missed her hugs and the smell of freshly brewed tea. While Duke had felt like a new home freshman year, I missed my family. The 5000 miles between Durham and Buenos Aires were gnawing away at the hole in my chest. With tickets already bought, though, there wasn’t much my mother could do to comfort me, other than help me count down the days. When December finally arrived, two weeks back home in the Argentine sun and sand helped me reconnect with my body and reset my priorities. What did I want out of my Duke experience? If it was academic success, was I willing to commit to my hermit status in exchange for my mental health? Despite my best intentions, I felt the familiar pit in my stomach as soon as I returned to campus. The anxiety came rushing back to me. It was then that I admitted to myself what I had known since winter break — I had to do something to break the cycle. During a post-class lunch in Sanford, my friend mentioned club soccer and how she loved the community it had given her. Little did she know, our conversation sent me spiraling into research mode. Could I join a team this late in the year? Would I have to pay dues with just two weeks left in the Spring semester? More importantly, could I play soccer when I’d never kicked a ball in my life (except for that disastrous sixth-grade kickball tournament)? After learning that I could, in fact, still join, I set my sights on soccer. My experience? None. So, to prepare, I took it upon myself to get out of my comfort zone that summer. I jumped out of a plane and consequently got over my plane-related anxiety (I’m an international student — I fly at least twice a year), camped on an island I had to ferry to and traveled to China by myself through a Duke program. Now, it was time to face my fears on campus. So, at 8:45 a.m. last Saturday, I headed to Wannamaker Drive for our first game of the season. As I triple-checked my packing list for our two-and-a-half-hour drive, I realized I was forgetting the most essential part of my fit: my brand-new cleats. After chucking them in my bag and panicking about whether I was headed to the right Wannamaker pick-up spot, I was out the door. As a new player, I’ve volunteered for any position needed in practices to see what I like. But I should’ve crammed some prep in beforehand, because UNC-Wilmington brought their A-game. Five minutes into the game in drizzling Wilmington, I was already breathless. Everyone seemed to sprint circles around me, while I was secretly praying for a sub. I had no clue what position I was playing; I was just trying to circulate enough air through my body to stay conscious. The redhead I tried (but failed) to mark was breathing down my neck as though she could conjure my handball with her breath. Spoiler alert: she did. By the time I was finally subbed out, all I felt was relief and a distinct longing for my pink Nalgene. But in hindsight, that moment was more important than I realized. I survived. No, I wasn’t going to become the next Messi, but that wasn’t the point. The experience was fun, absolutely humbling and strangely fulfilling. I discovered joy in the simple act of playing, learning something new and being part of something larger than just me. Before pushing myself to join club soccer, I was insanely focused on academics and success had become a metric of my worth. But in soccer, I’m not playing for one sole purpose — I’m playing for the experience, the community, and for myself. Sometimes, happiness isn’t uncovering a new talent — screw your perfectionism — it’s discovering you can do things without an end goal simply because you enjoy them. You don’t have to be an expert to start something new in college. Whether it’s a sport, a hobby or any extracurricular, what you gain from putting yourself out there can be far more valuable than a trophy or a title. I’m finding my footing (no pun intended) on the soccer team not because I’m a standout player, but because I’ve allowed myself to embrace the joy of being a part of it. And if you’re reading this and wondering if you should try out a new sport, I encourage you to go for it, no matter if you’re a moral-support player or a goal-scorer. Duke covers the cost of one club sport through the Kevin Gorter Memorial Endowment. Whether it’s joining a new club, picking up a half-credit PE class or simply going to a practice, all it takes is one “yes.” You might be surprised at what you discover about yourself along the way.

Just a coffee isn’t breakfast: Freshmen need better meal equivalency  ,Kate-Yeonjae Jeong,2024-09-19T12:00:00Z,Sep,19,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/091924-jeong-freshman-meal-equivalency-20240919.html,"Often, with so many club meetings, rush events, sports practices and all the other things in between, it’s not rare to find yourself having to skip a proper meal in college. Duke’s solution to that is equivalency. If you’re in a rush, you can simply exchange your Marketplace “swipe” to get a meal at Trinity Cafe or select locations on West Campus. It sounds nice in theory. You don’t have to run half a mile so that you can have just barely enough time to sit down for a rushed meal. You can simply grab everything you need to-go, and get on the bus without running into the inevitable human traffic jams at the bus stop. However, thousands of freshmen have raised complaints about the flawed equivalency system — myself included. Under this system, if you want to exchange your Marketplace swipe — one where you would get a full buffet-style meal — for a meal equivalency, you get only $5.70 for breakfast and $10.90 for dinner. Your breakfast options are either Trinity Cafe, Skillet, or Marketplace (from noon onwards). Your dinner options are Trinity Cafe or a Board Plan swipe at Freeman Center Cafe. The main problem? The value of meal equivalency is simply not enough for a nutritious meal.With the current equivalency rate, students cannot buy a sandwich without going over the price limit. If you want to add coffee or even water to a breakfast pastry, you're way out of the equivalency range, and will have to pay out of pocket with food points. At that rate, it’s not too difficult to quickly run through your food points, making it an unsustainable design for students. I can’t help but feel disappointed with the way Duke has designed its equivalency system. At a ""work hard, play hard"" school like Duke, I’m constantly on the move; it’s difficult to squeeze time to even eat properly. Having just a cup of yogurt and an apple simply just isn’t enough to get through over 4 hours of classes. On top of that, Duke is supposed to be renowned for its amazing dining options — and I feel that my freshmen experience hasn’t lived up to it quite fully simply due to the restrictions placed by the equivalency system. The pricing isn’t the only issue. Trinity Cafe also doesn’t open until 8 a.m. on weekdays, so for students with an 8:30 a.m. class, it’s almost impossible to time correctly with the frequent bus traffic. On weekends, it’s even more problematic; Trinity Cafe doesn’t open until noon. When I had a morning interview for a club, I couldn’t even have breakfast in East Campus, so I had to ride the bus all the way to West for my only other option — The Skillet. At The Skillet, the only option that fits the $5.70 limit is an egg and cheese biscuit with one fruit. Behind the glass, I could clearly see the many breakfast-style options Skillet had — from French toast to omelets — but it was frustrating as those were not affordable and were out of reach. Not only that, with the limitations on the types of foods students can afford with equivalency, those who are gluten-free and have allergies are faced with even more restrictions. If the $5.70 equivalency rate is firmly set, it’s not unreasonable for students to request more dining options to eat at. With allergen-free places like ""It’s Thyme"" and breakfast-inspired menus at ""Sprout"" or ""Farmstead,"" expanding dining options could make student life easier. All in all, increased dining options for freshmen is something many students feel passionate about. With the upcoming student government election, freshmen are eagerly anticipating a hopeful and much-needed reform to addressing its limitations and challenges.

Democracy as competitive cooperation,Michael Tomasello,2024-09-19T12:00:00Z,Sep,19,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/091924-tomasello-democracy-cooperative-competition-20240919.html,"Democracy often seems like unfriendly competition, with all its arguing, partisanship, and mean-spirited attack ads. But underneath the rancor, democracy actually depends on a basic infrastructure of human cooperation.In evolution, cooperation is difficult. Individuals who want to pass along their genes must look out for themselves, often in competition with others. Nevertheless, some species have developed forms of win-win cooperation such that all cooperators benefit (more than non-cooperators). The champions of such cooperation are ants and bees, who are special because all the individuals in a nest or hive share the same queen mother, so it's all in the family.Humans around the world are great at cooperating in families. And early humans lived exclusively in small groups that were family-like in many ways: all group members were interdependent and helped one another reciprocally. But that Garden of Eden ended for most humans with the advent of agriculture and cities (a.k.a., civilization) some 10,000 years ago. As human cities and settlements grew ever larger and less family-like, small-scale cooperation based on interdependence and reciprocity was no longer up to the job.In the last few centuries, large-scale human groups have organized themselves cooperatively in two main ways. First, they have looked to an individual, or small group of individuals, to act as parent-like bosses who make sure that everyone behaves. But parents can be defied, and so some monarchs have fortified their authority with claims of divine imprimatur, while other autocrats have fortified their authority with weapons. When monarchs and autocrats are benevolent, this form of societal organization can work. But, as Lord Acton observed more than a century ago, “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”. So monarchs and dictators often foster discontent and discord in the populace and often end in one or another form of violence (or else in a powerless form of ceremonial monarchy, as in some European countries today).Second, the alternative to person-based, parent-like authority is group-based organization, the ultimate form being communism, in which the ideal is for the larger group to consider itself as one big family. But large-scale modern economies cannot function effectively in this way, as the Soviet Union discovered when it tried to collectivize its farmers to pool their bounty every year for the benefit of all. It turns out that people work much harder and more diligently when it is they and their immediate families (and not lazy free riders) who benefit. The problem with communism is thus that it has too optimistic a view of the human potential for cooperation. Or as E.O. Wilson, the great scholar of ants and bees, observed about the communist system: “Great idea. Wrong species.”And so have arisen in the modern world liberal democracies that allow individuals to pursue their self-interest so long as they follow cooperative rules of the game on which everyone in the group, through their representatives, agrees (rule of law). It is very much like a team sport in which competing teams, such as our beloved Blue Devils and those despised Tar Heels, fight tooth-and-nail to defeat one another — but all within a mutually agreed-upon set of cooperative rules. Liberal democracies aim at a healthy balance between competition and cooperation.And their aim does not always have to be perfect. That is because liberal democracies are self-correcting. Unlike in autocracies, if the agreed-upon rules no longer work for the common good, there are ways for the people or their representatives to change them. For this, everyone must agree not just on basic rules, but also on second-order rules for how to change and enforce the basic rules — for example, via constitutionally specified legislative and judicial procedures. And of course, we can also vote to change our representatives as well.Francis Fukuyama believes that, given human nature, modern liberal democracies are the best form of societal organization of which humans are capable. People vote with their feet, and those living in autocratic societies attempt to immigrate to liberal democracies much more often than the other way around. Nevertheless, autocrats are on the rise worldwide: we all sometimes wish for a parent who knows what is best for us and can make it happen. But as history has shown time and again, giving an autocrat power and hoping that they will use it for the common good is not a promising plan for good governance.Michael Tomasello is the James F.

"The kangaroo or the eagle: How independence, networking and the college experience differ across continents",Annie Ming Kowalik,2024-09-18T12:00:00Z,Sep,18,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/091824-ming-kowalik-kangaroo-and-eagle-20240918.html,"In the early days of the semester, when my 14-hour jet lag made waking up at 5:30 AM a habit, I would wander around West Campus. I’d video call my parents, who couldn’t come with me to Duke, and pause to marvel at every carved archway and poised squirrel. I was equally in awe of the variety of campus food choices and surprised that many didn’t open until 10:00 AM.My wide-eyed wonder at the grassy green quads, gardens and the sheer size of Wilson (A climbing wall? Excuse me?). The Maccas (or, as you’d call it, McDonald’s) in the Bryan Center constantly reminds me of the question I’ve been asked countless times since arriving: “What’s the biggest difference between your home and Duke?”As a visiting international student from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia, Duke has been the adventure of a lifetime. Yet, as I live, study, meet new people, and attend many sporting, cultural and musical events, I’ve become acutely aware that while all universities aim to educate and mentor capable, confident students, they approach this goal with very different ideologies.Of course, the vast difference in resources between UNSW and Duke plays a role — Duke’s annual budget was $7.7 billion for 2022, compared to UNSW’s $1.7 billion (adjusted from AUD to USD). But this isn’t just about resources; it’s about the mindset each institution cultivates.The most drastic shift in my lifestyle came with the arrival of my roommate on an unremarkable Friday before FDOC (I’m picking up the Americanisms). She’s lovely — we’ve become great friends, and we'll talk for hours into the night — but being assigned to live with a stranger is foreign to me. You mean I’m supposed to sleep 1.5 meters (that’s about 5 feet for non-metric users) away from someone I just met?Reflecting on this experience, I realize a roommate symbolizes a larger cultural difference in how the U.S. approaches college. Having a roommate is part of the American ethos of providing a built-in support system, creating an immediate social structure and cultivating skills beyond academics. It’s not just about sharing space — it’s about learning to communicate, navigate conflicts and build relationships, which are vital for personal development. In many ways, a roommate is a microcosm of the broader safety net U.S. universities construct for their students. With extensive academic support services and mental health resources, the system strives to ensure that students have a sense of community that catches them before they fall.I was astonished when I heard about Duke’s writing center, where students can receive feedback on their work. The option to discuss extra-credit assignments or take a professor to lunch for advice highlights a culture that values connection and mentorship as central pillars of learning. Here, college isn’t just about mastering content — it’s about building a network, advocating for yourself and seizing opportunities beyond the classroom.Contrast this with the Australian model, where most students live at home, in private accommodations, or, if on campus (a small minority), in private rooms. This setup fosters independence but often leads to a more solitary, self-sufficient experience. The expectation in Australia is that by the time you reach university, you’re ready to manage your academics and personal life with minimal external support. My largest class at Duke has 25 students, which feels luxurious compared to UNSW’s lecture halls, where 400 students are the norm. This forced self-reliance in Australia teaches you to navigate university life independently, without the same level of guidance or built-in social structures. This difference in philosophy extends to the admissions process. Discussing with new friends how we transitioned from high school to university, I was struck by how the differences across our countries promote different schools of thought. In Australia, admissions are almost entirely based on academic performance in state-wide exams and your Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR), which assigns students a country-wide rank in comparison with all other students. It’s straightforward: your ATAR determines your eligibility for your degree (apart from a few exceptions that may have additional constraints). Your grades largely determine your path. In Australia, there’s a deeply ingrained culture of earning your achievements, with a more pejorative attitude towards leveraging connections for personal gain. This attitude shapes how we approach opportunities and relationships.Here in the U.S., I’ve been struck by the transactional nature of some interactions, where networking and self-promotion are common. The insincerity with which I am asked about my week, or my opinion on this or that, can be jarring. At first, these conversations felt more about gaining something than forming genuine connections. But over time, I realized this wasn’t intentional; instead, it reflects how deeply embedded networking and opportunity-seeking are in American culture. People here expect to build relationships that will help them professionally and personally throughout their university years.The American admissions system mirrors this focus on building a narrative. Grades are just one part of a much larger puzzle that includes personal essays, recommendation letters, extracurricular activities, leadership roles and, crucially, your ability to communicate who you are and why you belong at a particular institution. It’s a process that demands networking, storytelling and knowing how to present yourself in a way that aligns with what universities want to see.These cultural differences — from college life to social dynamics — shape how people interact in the real world. In the U.S., the focus on striving to be recognised and networking echo the college experience of crafting a professional identity. Meanwhile, Australia’s more relaxed approach to social and political conversations mirrors the emphasis on self-reliance and authenticity.The contrasting college experiences in the U.S. and Australia influence how people interact and build relationships well after they graduate. In America, I’ve noticed that a common conversation starter is often centered around work — your job becomes a key part of your identity. This focus on professional life reflects the importance placed on career-building, which starts in college and continues into the workplace. On the other hand, in Australia (and many other places overseas), work tends to be a topic more avoided in casual conversation. Social interactions are less driven by professional ambition, and there’s a sense that who you are is not solely defined by what you do for a living.Ultimately, both systems offer valuable lessons. The American focus on collaboration can inspire Australians to embrace networking without sacrificing authenticity, while Australia’s emphasis on self-reliance can remind Americans of the importance of personal accountability. I’m immensely grateful to my Australian education for fostering my independence and teaching me to navigate challenges with confidence. At the same time, I’m eager to learn as much as possible from my time here at Duke, embracing new opportunities and expanding my perspectives.Annie Ming Kowalik is a Pratt sophomore and a visiting international student from the University of New South Wales.

Why law abiding young people should cherish the rule of law,David Schanzer,2024-09-17T12:00:00Z,Sep,17,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/091724-schanzer-cherish-rule-of-law-20240917.html,"I imagine that few Duke students have spent much time thinking about the rule of law or worrying about its potential demise. After all, Duke students are almost always law-abiding citizens that, for the most part, do not need to fear arbitrary arrest and prosecution. I imagine very few have ever been hauled into criminal or civil court to defend themselves and had to rely on a lawyer, judge or jury to make sure they were not treated unjustly.So why should Duke students fret about the possibility that the rule of law might be eroded depending on the results of the next election? The reason is that the rule of law is the foundation of a free society. Once the rule of law erodes, it is difficult to recover. Without the rule of law, life as you know it, even as a student at Duke, would be unrecognizable compared to today. So, what is this amorphous concept of the “rule of law” and why is such an important component of a liberal democracy?At its most fundamental, the rule of law is a core restraint on the exercise of governmental power. The rule of law requires that when the government affects the citizenry, it must act consistent with a set of preexisting rules put in place by democratically elected bodies accountable to the people. The rule of law also requires a set of institutions, like an independent judiciary, capable of enforcing these rules and making sure they are applied fairly. For example, consider student loans and Pell Grants. Students don’t get notice that arbitrarily tells them how much money they are going to get in loans and grants (yes, I know FAFSA was messed up this year — but you know what I mean). Rather, in our rule of law society, Congress enacts laws that establish how student loans and Pell grants are going to be calculated. Executive agencies, like the Department of Education, interpret these laws and publish a set of detailed rules and instructions about how loans and grants are calculated. After getting your financial information, Duke applies the rules and calculates the proper loan and/or grant amount. If you don’t agree with the calculation, you can submit an appeal to Duke arguing that the rules were not properly applied to your individual circumstances. But consider what could happen if the United States were ruled by an individual determined not to be constrained by the rule of law. This leader sorts society into favored and disfavored groups. This president could order his Secretary of Education, a total loyalist who he appointed, to give larger student financial aid to the parts of society he believes deserves them and low or no assistance to groups of students he disdains. Consider the myriad of discretionary decisions that governments make every day that can affect your lives: visas for family members traveling to the United States, enforcement of food and safety regulations in a restaurant, issuance of green cards to provide work authorization, wage increases for government employees and on and on. A government unconstrained by rules is a government that can exercise its discretionary power over people’s lives to punish dissent, force conformity and coerce allegiance. Don’t count on an independent judiciary to save the day. If a leader permeates a culture where the rule of law no longer applies, even a fair and independent judiciary will quickly become overwhelmed. Think about how expensive it would be and how long it would take to hire a lawyer and go to court to correct your student financial aid level. Justice delayed is often justice denied.Leaders unconstrained by the rule of law can exercise power in a myriad of ways to get their way, including how elections are conducted and votes are counted. Imagine an anti-rule-of-law leader asking an election official to ""find 11,780 votes"" to win an election and that official, worried about how governmental power might be used personally against him, succumbs to pressure to do so. When the rule of law no longer constrains even election officials, the jig is up for democracy.One would expect that if the rule of law were so fundamental to our system of government, then surely the Constitution must have mechanisms to protect the citizenry from a potential authoritarian.The sad answer is that there is no constitutional provision that codifies the rule of law. The Constitution provides only one remedy to restrain a lawless president — impeachment by the House and conviction and removal by the Senate, which has never occurred in our 248 year history. This summer’s Supreme Court decision that presidents are immune from criminal prosecution for actions that fall within their defined constitutional duties has made it even more difficult to hold future presidents accountable for lawless conduct. The rule of law is an unwritten “norm.” It is a culture of law-abiding that has permeated our society and has been institutionalized as a fundamental principle within our government. For example, there is a long tradition, written into executive branch policy, that presidents should not interfere with the Department of Justice’s discretionary decisions on opening criminal investigations and seeking indictments. This “norm” exists to prevent politics from impacting one of the most powerful actions any government can take — prosecuting a person for a crime and taking away personal liberty. But this norm is not an ironclad enforceable law. There is nothing stopping a president from violating it. Indeed, a president could appoint a loyalist Attorney General who also does not respect the rule of law, then that appointee could acquiesce in allowing the president to use the criminal justice system as a tool of politics. The same holds true of other agencies with coercive power like the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service and on and on. The ultimate protection against abuse of the rule of law is the people themselves. We are the ones responsible for protecting the rule of law by carefully scrutinizing those who seek the awesome power that comes with the office of the presidency (as well as those who run for other executive offices like governor or mayor). A citizenry that plays fast and loose with giving power to an individual that finds law a mere inconvenience and cares not a whit for the norms and traditions of democracy is playing a dangerous game. For once the electoral votes are counted and the Chief Justice administers the oath of office, all the power of the presidency immediately vest in that one person. Norms and traditions can be ignored with impunity. So, when you go to cast your ballot this year, and I hope you do, it is all of our solemn duty, to consider which candidate will respect and protect the rule of law that keeps our society safe and free.

 Failure is the only option,Aaron Siegle,2024-09-16T15:00:00Z,Sep,16,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/091624-siegle-20240916.html,"“If you don’t fail, then you aren’t even trying” is the most oft-quoted line from Denzel Washington’s 2011 graduation speech at the University of Pennsylvania. The speech, regarded amongst the most iconic commencement addresses of all time by CNN, urges listeners to view failure as a critical step to reaching unprecedented accomplishments. If you try enough times, then you will eventually succeed.In 2024, Washington’s optimism and fearless attitude can seem myopic. After all, 2011 was a year of progress. Global economies rebounded after the Great Recession, advances in leukemia technology resulted in a breakthrough in cancer treatment and the Occupy Wall Street movement forced corporations to rethink their unethical actions. Now, faced with a contentious Presidential election and an uncertain future, optimizing for failure seems like folly. After all, failure implies that we’ve messed up, fallen short of a goal or become too distracted to focus on what’s really important. Failure is embarrassing — something that should be avoided at all costs. But failure is also inevitable. Can you think of a friend who has never failed? Failure, in an instant, can shatter the reputation you have worked for a lifetime to protect. If failure is both cataclysmic and ubiquitous, then how can any gains ever be realized?The answer lies in changing our perspective on failure. Embracing failure doesn’t mean lowering our standards and condoning inaction. But it does entail a wholistic reevaluation of what success looks like and a deeper examination of why we want the things that we want. Failure is the engine that drives change. By setting ourselves up for failure, we change the world.Gen Z (those of us born after 1997) are often criticized for being averse to failure, part of a broader narrative of young people’s softness and intolerance to opposing ideas. And this is by-on-large true. Research has shown that Gen Zers have “a heightened aversion to negative events, including failure.” Part of this can be attributed to the pervasive cultural narrative that society is made up of two distinct groups, the winners and the losers, and it sucks to be on the losing side. Furthermore, the dogma goes, winners owe nothing to the losers, regardless of how they won. An example of this worldview is clearly communicated in Nike’s ad aired during the Paris 2024 Olympics. The commercial, titled “Winning Isn’t For Everyone,” lambastes the values of empathy, compassion, respect and humility, all while displaying a slideshow of the world’s most successful athletes. It broadcasts that core human values are antithetical to success in competition.In another age, such an ideology would be denounced as authoritarian propaganda. But today, ruthless winning is a vogue marketing strategy. If winning is seen as necessary at all costs and losing means a life filled with pain and agony, then of course Gen Z would avoid failure at any price. The problem is that failure isn’t a path to death and destruction, it’s the foundation upon which innovation is built on. To produce something new that is useful for society, one must experiment in uncharted waters. In this realm, there are no training wheels — no academic literature to rely upon, no instruction manual to follow, and no assurance of success. These are spaces where failure is most likely to occur, and, in some cases, is inevitable. Doing something that humanity has never done before is an iterative process. Research from the University of Bristol Business School has shown that failure disrupts the status quo, puts fundamental truths in question and aids in the knowledge transfer process. Indeed, failure is the driver of America’s economic success. One of America’s greatest attractions is that provides a space to fail, and thus learn. Imagine this. One day you woke up and every time you played your favorite sport, you won. Despite how hard your opponent played or how much talent they accrued; you would inevitably win. Would you still play the game?In the same way, what is the point of living life if you know that you will succeed in everything you do? The predictability of your success diminishes its significance. Yet, despite this, we expect perfection from ourselves and struggle to learn from mistakes when things inevitably go wrong. The craving for success is an indication that one’s actions are extrinsically motivated — as in, rooted in power, money and fame. Yet, a true embracing of failure comes only when one is intrinsically motivated, when someone is willing to do something regardless of the outcome. Many figures we celebrate as successes lived lives marked by failure. According to his own record, Thomas Edison failed 2,774 times before successfully developing an incandescent lightbulb. We can learn something from Edison’s approach to failure. He famously said, “I have not failed 10,000 times — I’ve successfully found 10,000 ways that will not work.” Duke professor and Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, Robert Lefkowitz, stated that most of the research he does fails. Over his many years of mentoring students, he noticed how the ones who initially struggled the most eventually became the most accomplished scientists. This is because these individuals weren’t afraid of risk — they relished the opportunity to engage with the most vexing challenges.Our society needs more failures. With our minds glued to the hedonic treadmill of success, we render failure impossible. By minimizing the possibility of failure we are unable to solve our own problems and the problems of those around us. To solve pressing problems, we need to create a learning environment that incentivizes failure. This doesn’t mean more superficial ""fail fests"" or A’s for effort, but a framework that teaches us how to fail and glean valuable information from that failing. In order to learn from our mistakes, we have to acknowledge that we make mistakes in the first place. Encouraging failure is hard. But living with the regret of unpursued dreams for fear of trying is harder.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity junior. His pieces typically run on alternate Fridays."
Drag science and the slaying of nerd aesthetic,Nik Narain,2024-09-14T12:00:00Z,Sep,14,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/091424-narain-drag-science-20240914.html,"The past decade has seen a surge of global collaborations between science and fashion. We’ve seen the rise of online stores selling science clothes ranging from quirky to couture, such as MySciGear’s seemingly infinite selection of quality nerd puns and Svaha’s specific emphasis on breaking gender stereotypes in STEM through their clothing. Science-inspired clothing has made its way to high fashion, like with Dr. Yuly Fuentes-Medel’s 2014 collaboration Descience, which fostered collaborations with scientists and fashion designers to bring “research to the runway.” Within its Media Labs and in collaboration with the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT), MIT has been a pioneer in developing sustainable and high-tech methods for textile production such as 3D-printed fabrics. And just this past May, the Museum of Science in Boston celebrated its own sustainable fashion show. As the founder of Boston Fashion Week, Jay Calderin, stated, “science and technology are the future of fashion.” Why not embrace it?In the midst of this interdisciplinary SciArt explosion of dad humor and mycelium skirts (‘shroom leather, anyone?), there’s an intermediary space where science has arguably seen its most prominent boom in visibility: drag. Since 2020, The Royal Canadian Institute for Science has proudly supported the world’s first science-themed drag show, Science is a Drag, an annual show made by and for queer people to create a community where people can share and engage with science in an inclusive and authentic manner. Through lip-syncs, stand-up, and live science demonstrations, the show’s team of expert science communicators has won several global awards for their intersectional SciComm (science communication) work. Science-themed drag events for all ages have since grown increasingly popular, even here in Durham at local drag queen Stormie Daie’s “Science with Stormie” shows.Outside of in-person events, many science drag artists have utilized TikTok and Instagram as their primary platform, such as Pattie Gonia’s environmental activism and Anna Lytical’s coding education. Most notably, drag queen, online math communicator and competitor on the first season of Canada’s Drag Race Kyne Santos (known mononymously as Kyne) published the first-ever book combining STEM and drag. ""Math in Drag"" draws upon a combination of math history lessons, explainers, and personal anecdotes as a drag queen to embrace math’s inner beauty in a unique way. ""Math in Drag"" was called a “spectacle” by the Johns Hopkins University Press and an excerpt from the book was featured in the popular science podcast and magazine Science Friday.Drag is already a highly contested art form, with several U.S. states passing legislation to restrict or ban drag altogether. Critics have called drag “threatening and vile” for children, and politicians have designed laws with vague enough wording to ban many forms of nonconforming gender expression, even in a non-drag or performance-related context. What does it mean for drag to be used as science education if a loud group of Americans doesn’t even want drag near their children? Is “wearing” and “performing” science a valid enough form of SciComm? While I don’t think science drag is on the same level of educational attainment as, say, a PBS Nova documentary or a well-crafted museum exhibit, I think the purpose extends into something far more fundamental. That is, incorporating scientific concepts and scientific practices in fashion, dance, performance, etc., offers a whole new way of reconciling and conceptualizing the fact that science can not only be beautiful, but glamorous, desirable, something worthy of being flaunted. That science can be colorful, humorous, and over-the-top if needed. Science is a process as equally as it is a product. Why not have fun and look hot while doing it? As both drag and science become increasingly politicized, sometimes making a statement about drag and/or science itself is as important as more traditional forms of media-based education. To say “science is a drag” or to discuss “math in drag,” is to say that science is for all gender expressions and identities, and drag is for education and empowerment, in stark contrast with the traditional narratives of what science and drag looks like and who it is intended for.People like to think that SciComm is a watering-down of “the hard stuff” like diluting a cup of strong coffee, when in reality SciComm is about creating something palatable, strong, and exciting, like an espresso machine (if you don’t like coffee, I apologize if this metaphor doesn’t apply). If the goal of SciComm is not just to improve the dissemination of scientific information, but to promote excitement and engagement for science itself, what better way to do that than through drag, which enables performers to celebrate science on such a personal level? To slay nerd fashion with such confidence and curiosity, whether it be through drag, at a fashion school, or even in everyday wear, is one small but powerful part of the future of SciComm.Nik Narain is a Trinity senior.

The new social contract that permeates Duke student life,Zubin Rekhi,2024-09-13T14:15:00Z,Sep,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/091324-rekhi-new-social-contract-20240913.html,"An eye-opening New York Times article, written by a professor at neighboring UNC-Chapel Hill, Dr. Rita Koganzon, caught my attention last week. It describes how universities are increasingly extending a mix of carrots and sticks to control more aspects of student life. She explains that as part of the ever-expansive “facilitator model” that has taken hold, universities have reinstated control over student life, in which “It’s not that students don’t have rights; it’s just that safety comes first.” According to her, as universities began to expand and supersede a fixed definition of “safety,” they extended carrots — “relative generosity to their students” — to legitimize their enlarged presence. I believe this dynamic is playing out at Duke. There are many previousarticles in The Chronicle outlining how the university often infantilizes its student body by restricting their choices. There are others that detail how the university extends generosity to the student body — in some quarters, deserved, in others, not so much. I believe that generosity and control are two sides of the same coin, demonstrating an evolving social contract in which benefits experienced by the student body are, often implicitly, conditioned on further restrictions in other facets of student life.This system offers students more benefits in certain quarters while restricting their autonomy in others. Let’s start with the benefits. In the classroom, grade inflation, for example, has been extensively covered by The Chronicle. Students now take weed-out classes like Econ 101 and Public Policy 155 on a S/U, rather than graded, basis. Even for those classes that are graded, they are likely to get an A, without much legwork — the cutoff to be top 25% for last Spring’s juniors in Trinity was a 3.92 GPA and in Pratt was a 3.877. Outside the classroom, students enjoy performances on LDOC featuring Swae Lee and on Founder’s Day featuring Ed Sheeran on campus, some of the best student dining food in the country, freshly renovated (and costly) dorms in even our oldest buildings, rapid shuttle frequency to get us on and off campus with convenience between 6:30 AM and 12:30 PM and DukeVans to get us home at night at the touch of a button as late as 2:30 AM. I want to acknowledge three caveats here. One, not all of this generosity is equally deserved — for example, I support DukeVans that enhance student safety, while opposing the more pernicious effects of grade inflation. Two, many of these benefits arose due to student advocacy — for example, to extend DukeVan service for student safety concerns — and not out of the beneficence of the administration. Three, many of these improvements exist amidst lingering concerns — for example, concerning dining affordability — and they’re not as universally or equitably enjoyed as I’d like. However, for the most part, Duke students have it pretty good in student life — at least better than many alumni or many of our parents can attest to when recounting their college experiences.On the flip side, however, administration is more involved than ever in student life. With the establishment of the QuadEx system, Duke students now live on campus for three, and often all four years, in contrast to peerschools. In their first year, students are assigned random roommates and in their second, they must move in tandem with their first year Quad community to a West campus quad. As late as their sophomore year, students are inhibited from choosing roommates beyond their assigned quads, and as late as senior year, students regularly live on campus. When students want to study abroad,students face program caps for their desired destination if it, like Copenhagen or Madrid, is popular with the student body. Hungry students need not worry if they are allergic to nuts: there is no Panda Express with tempting late-night treats; no almond milk in campus coffee shops and no peanuts in my pad thai at Ginger & Soy.In other words, the definition of “safety” that originally targeted hazing rituals in the 1980s has now become so broad that it encompasses facets unrelated to safety. As the university went from being a neutral facilitator, taking a hands-off approach to all student actions clearing the low bar of safety, to an active participant with veto power over student choices, it also used its expanded powers — in ways intentional or not — to extend benefits to students. The same administrators that forcefully inserted themselves in conversations about roommate selection, for example, renovated old West Campus dorms, giving them alluring living spaces, bathrooms and amenities. The same dining authorities that took away Panda Express and peanuts from WU also renovated it into a world-class, aesthetically pleasing facility serviced by an array of local vendors. And the same academic deans that made studying abroad in our desired programs harder also acquiesced to making school easier.But college students are adults and we should make our choices, even in the midst of an evolving and enlarging university apparatus. I’m proud of the fact that my classmates have gone out of their way to reject this saccharine social contract that offers us benefits conditioned on increased control, demonstrating maturity in the face of infantilizing — but often lifestyle-enhancing — rules. I implore Duke administration to listen to my colleagues and treat them like adults — by listening to their calls for scaling back their control over student life.Zubin Rekhi is a Trinity junior.

Why you should read below your reading level,Anna Garziera,2024-09-13T12:00:00Z,Sep,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/091324-garziera-read-below-level-20240913.html,"I kicked off my summer one day early last semester. The day before my Math 212 final, I went outside and opened a book. It wasn’t a math textbook, though. It was L. M. Montgomery’s ""Anne of Green Gables.""Nine hours of reading got me through to the last page. What Joy it brought me! Satisfaction wrapped me like a warm blanket. After a year of reading next to no books outside of school, this accomplishment felt like a breath of fresh air. So, after school ended in May and I returned home, all enthusiastic, I embarked on a quest to read as much as I could this summer. You see, I come from a family of readers. My dad reads most of all, devouring literature as fast as he does pickles; my mom savors books more slowly and my sister Linda had just published her first book as part of her high school’s creative writing program earlier in the spring. On paper, there should be no reason why I should not be an avid reader too. But my journey towards appreciating books is a little more rocky than that. In middle school, I read little besides mystery novels — all of Agatha Christie’s Poirot mysteries, among others — but that’s not to say I read little. I often got myself into ruts, where I finished one book every evening of the week. But as I grew up, I started to view these books as childish. That’s when I stopped reading altogether. Fast forward to the latter part of my senior year of high school, when classes started to slack off — or rather, I was starting to slack off — and I had to find something fun to fill my school days. One at a time, my literature teacher lent me every book on his bookshelf. The more I read, the more I started to like reading. It became so part of my routine that soon, I couldn’t live without it. But freshman year of college threw men off the tracks again. With demanding classes, clubs and friends to think about, I once again pushed reading to the back burner. By the time finals week rolled around, I needed another reading-recovery period desperately. This past summer was exactly that — I happily fell back into the rabbit hole. Each time that I take up reading again after a dry spell is similar: I go back to my beloved mystery novels. I’ve realized that I have to start with easy, enjoyable books to get back into the rhythm, to convince myself that I do like reading, after all. As growing adults, we let go of good habits easily. After a week of morning runs, we happily push off the next day of training until six months later. During the first week of classes, our class notes could be framed — they’re so neat. Towards the end of the semester, they’re barely legible — if they exist at all. On our third day carrying our water bottle that has motivational hydration markers, we barely get past “Good Morning.” The next day we leave it at home. Few of us have kept up the daily 30 minutes of independent reading since middle school. And no wonder. There’s no surefire way of letting go of the habit of reading than forcibly plowing through a book you don’t like. The problem is that young people immediately become discouraged after opening a bad book — become convinced that they unfortunately just don’t enjoy reading. Instead of trying again, this is often accepted as a fact, a personality trait, and not questioned again until late adulthood. Duke students are no exception. As much as we celebrate self-improvement at our school, we don’t read half as much as we should, given the benefits it brings us. Perhaps, this is entirely due to a misunderstanding. I won’t blow your mind by saying that the student population here at Duke is, on average, fairly ambitious. We take classes we feel unprepared for, start researching as freshmen and are part of more clubs than there are days in the week. We dream big. Naturally, when we pick up a book, we don’t want it to be any old book. We want to read big. We want to limit our candidates to only lengthy manuscripts in tedious Old English. All the better if they’re a well-known classic. But we’re only human — we get stuck after the fourth page. It’s no wonder that picking up Tolstoy after several unscholarly months creates friction. In today’s age of technology, when our brains are used to being overstimulated and our attention spans average a few seconds, committing to reading word after word on a black-and-white page can feel daunting. The best way to break down that wall of resistance is to do the very thing that feels wrong: read an easier book. And I’m not talking about merely shifting from Shakespeare to Virginia Woolf. I mean a much easier book. There seems to be a widely unquestioned misconception that one should always read at or above their reading level. While this can be empowering for third-grade readers, I feel that for adults who last picked up a book in February, this restriction no longer applies. There are a couple of reasons for that. First and foremost, no matter how simple a book may be, it will always require more intellect than scrolling through TikTok. Even books of a low reading level can teach us something. I was surprised to find that Agatha Christie’s Poirot mysteries lie somewhere between the 6th and 10th grade levels. Granted, my mother tongue is not English, but I learn a new word or expression from these novels every other page. Like all things, reading skills are built from the bottom up. Not only will reading simpler books help brush up some cognitive skills, but it will also improve imagination, memory, stress, empathy and sleep, to name a few. These benefits aren’t singular to big, lengthy, intellectually challenging novels. Importantly, as a habit of reading is formed, pulp fiction or “silly” mystery novels will no longer satisfy a highly intellectual mind. In other words, we need not fear being “dumbed down” by simple books. I admit that finding a book that makes one’s heart sing is no easy task. When we’re not used to reading, this is even harder — with 87 genres to pick from and critics using words like “satiric,” “insightful” and “prolific” in every blurb, we’re lost in indecision. Perhaps, finding an enjoyable book — a sure-safe title that is easy to read — is a good starting point. At the end of the day, there’s a clear answer between choosing whether to read below your level or not at all. And think about this: there’s no harm in trying. If even Agatha Christie fails to convince you that reading is more fulfilling than scrolling, then you may immediately go back to your phone, knowing in your heart that, intellectually speaking, you cannot be worse off than before.

Staying back: On first semester junior year,Advikaa Anand,2024-09-11T12:00:00Z,Sep,11,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/091124-anand-staying-back-20240911.html,"I remember my first day of freshman year vividly: the rush of adrenaline through my veins as I jumped out of bed to get to Marketplace brunch in time, the excitement as I introduced myself to new friends every hour and the sweet confusion of meandering West Campus for hours as I accidentally wandered into Duke Law School while searching for Sanford. I also remember my first day of sophomore year with great fondness. The thrilling sense of excitement that characterized freshman year had been usurped with a warm comfort as I smiled at recognizable faces in BC plaza and walked campus with the certainty of knowing exactly where I was going. The things that seemed so frightening freshman year — trying to make new friends, navigating Duke’s campus, and getting academically situated — now evolved into second nature, like I was dancing a familiar dance with an old friend. Nothing stepped on my toes, and I fell into a quick rhythm that pulsed in my bones and warmed my heart. But my arrival to campus to start my junior year carried none of these feelings of excitement or warmth; instead, as I walked around campus after setting up my dorm, I was filled with dread. I searched the multitude of people scattered around the quad on the first day of class, hoping for a glimpse of recognition. All I saw, however, was a sea of strangers, and a hollow emptiness developed in the pit of my stomach. Where was I? Who were these people? What had happened to the place I’d called home for the last two years?Although I had known that interpersonal dynamics around campus would be different this semester due to the large exodus of juniors who have gone abroad, I did not expect to see such a drastic shift in the patterns of my own social life. There is a wistful remarkability in this observation — how a beloved place can transform into a mighty stranger when it no longer carries the people it brought you to love. And so, I spent the first two weeks of this semester yearning for my old life at Duke — the blockmates interrupting intense microeconomic study sessions in my room, the people who I’d see only in passing as we crisscrossed the pathways in front of Perkins but whose smiles I’d grown accustomed to seeing daily, and the constant supply of friends with whom I could eat dinner, study and even do the laundry. During the later hours of the evening that I’d normally spend with people, I find myself alone.Often, in solitude, my thoughts spiral. I find myself wallowing in the misery of my loneliness, plagued by the imagination of the experiences I might have relished had I not chosen to stay at Duke this semester and a nagging worry of how these sentiments might be exacerbated in the months ahead. But as I am learning, life cannot be a leap from one incredible high to the next. My search for a constant adventure in every day is not only futile but also dangerous. While mundane moments of alone time may bring dark thoughts that surface our innermost fears and insecurities, they must nevertheless be confronted. I am unraveling my constant need for social stimulation through seizing opportunities for personal reflection. There is a unique joy in building relationships that are simply between one’s self and a moment, like the vibrant pink and purple sunset sinking behind the Chapel that I stopped to admire last week. Or the soft cool breeze bringing respite from the harsh summer sun as it filled my lungs this afternoon. Or even the feeling of pleasure that envelops my consciousness as I wake from a heady afternoon nap. Perhaps it is only through spending time by ourselves that we can learn to feel everything so very deeply, even the sweet pain of missing the people we love. Growing to appreciate the mundane nature of everyday life has only heightened these feelings of overwhelming affection for those who are close to my heart. In the meantime, I’ll continue to become my own friend so that when I meet those who are gone from campus for now, we can enrich each other’s lives with the experiences we weathered alone.

Your first learning assignment: College roommates ,Sarah Gaither,2024-09-10T12:00:00Z,Sep,10,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/091024-gaither-college-roommates-20240910.html,"I will always remember walking into my freshman dorm on UC Berkeley’s campus — excited and eager to meet my new roommate for the first time. (Remember, this was before Facebook or any social media so I only knew my roommate’s name!) I walked into my room and my roommate wasn’t there, but her things were all moved in — an organized desk, a neatly made bed with monogrammed blankets, a full-sized Texas state flag hung on the wall and a framed family photo of her with former President George Bush. It was proof that a randomized roommate policy truly was giving me an opportunity to live with someone very different than myself, as a strongly identified Democrat from California. I was nervous to say the least — what do we talk about? What will she believe? How will I react if she says something I don’t endorse? I was so incredibly focused on how different we might be that it set up my expectations all wrong. It turns out, she and I had so much in common despite this one difference. And it was those initial conversations that were key in discovering just how much we could learn from each other. You see, this is exactly why randomized roommate policies work — they create opportunities for us to get to know someone new, someone different from ourselves, someone we likely wouldn’t meet otherwise. Duke is one of many campuses that has recently switched to a randomized roommate policy for first year students. My own college experience, combined with data we collected here at Duke, show that living with someone who is different can diversify our friend networks, expand our senses of self and teach us to think more flexibly. Although living with my roommate didn’t change my political beliefs or party affiliation, I do think that particular part of my college experience prepared me for living today in a political swing state like North Carolina. It’s true, we definitely experienced some conflict and some disagreements. But it is those disagreements that gave us the needed practice and experience in learning how to navigate differences, which is one of those invaluable skills all of us should leave college with. I have always said to find comfort in your discomfort, and I promise you that you will learn something about yourself and others by doing this. And this is what the democratic process is all about — people actively participating in the decision-making process where complementary and competing interests are all vying for respect and votes. This fall marks one of the biggest presidential elections in modern history, combined with a politically charged governor race here in North Carolina. If the work on intergroup contact theory from psychology has shown us anything, it is that positive long-term meaningful, and even indirect, contact with people who are different significantly reduces levels of prejudice. Thus, your college dorm room has the power to reduce bias! Your college dorm room has the potential to create needed opportunities for both listening and dialogue! And even that friend of your roommate has the ability to help teach you something new. Past research has shown that having equal status (you are both students here at Duke), common goals (wanting to survive college), no intergroup competition (you are part of a bigger Duke or dorm community) and authority sanction (Duke endorses its randomized roommate policy) all leads to higher chances for intergroup contact to succeed in reducing bias. So this fall, when everyone will be experiencing various levels of stress and anxiety linked to the election, practice democracy by talking to your roommate or someone new on campus. Democracy is defined as power being with the people. Thus, each of you has the power to create connections and to create change, both here on our own campus but also broadly through the act of voting. Even if you can’t vote here in the U.S., I still challenge you to go and learn from others on this campus and elsewhere. This is the beauty of being human and why social connection is essential to our survival. Dr. Sarah E. Gaither is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience.

"Racism, fatphobia and child labor: Duke welcomes Lululemon with open arms",Felix Jones,2024-09-09T12:00:00Z,Sep,9,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/090924-jones-lululemon-racism-duke-20240909.html,"Duke announced the opening of a Lululemon shop at the University Store Aug. 21. Lululemon has a long-standing history of fatphobia and anti-Asian racism. This decision does not sit right with me.Lululemon’s history of racism dates back to the company’s very inception; in a 2004 interview, founder Chip Wilson said he chose a name with three L’s in it because Japanese people struggle to pronounce that sound and “[i]t’s funny to watch them try to say it.”I know no other brand whose name was crafted as an explicit, racially-toned joke at the expense of an entire ethnic group. In the nearly two decades since this information became public, Lululemon has not changed its name. A name is the most integral part of a brand’s identity, and I’m deeply uncomfortable with a brand whose identity was borne out of anti-Asian sentiment.Wilson has also made fatphobic comments directed at his customer base. When Lululemon recalled some women’s yoga pants in 2013 after complaints that they were see-through, Wilson took it upon himself to announce that “some women’s bodies just don’t work for it” and that it’s an issue of “the rubbing through the thighs.” When products don’t live up to consumer’s expectations, companies will typically rework their product to satisfy their customer base; for Lululemon, the problem is instead the size of women’s bodies. So before you buy leggings from the Duke x Lululemon collab, remember that unless you have a thigh gap, these clothes weren’t made for you.Wilson released a book in which he wrote that he “isn’t necessarily opposed to child labor,” which he sees as “excellent training for life.” He also noted that Asian children are faced with the choice to work or starve: “I liked the working alternative.” Wilson added that his own children “have worked in the family business since the age of five, without pay.” In response to criticism of his “not necessarily opposed” stance on child labor, Wilson and his employees fought back by dressing up as babies while working sewing machines. Wilson’s rationale: “Nobody could accuse us of child labor, because we agreed with it.” Problem solved.This past January, Wilson did an interview with Forbes in which he lamented the “unhealthy,” “sickly” and “not inspirational” appearances of Lululemon models. He added that he believes “the definition of a brand is that you’re not everything to everybody…You’ve got to be clear that you don’t want certain customers coming in.” In the same interview, he expressed disdain for the “whole diversity and inclusion thing” at Lululemon; while it’s not clear whether this is about race or body type, his track record suggests it’s probably both.Wilson has explicitly identified Lululemon’s target group as “Super Girls,” defined as a young woman with “an amazing career and spectacular health” and considerable disposable income. I suppose that’s in line with Duke’s well-documented preference for wealthy students. Duke enrolls more students from the top 1% than the entire bottom 60% combined. Duke ranks 2,140th in share of students in the bottom 20% of family income. It’s an issue President Price likes to talk about, but Duke has rarely made the tough decisions required to make the school more welcoming to kids outside the upper echelons of society.Wilson resigned in 2013 but remains not only the largest individual shareholder, but also the third largest single shareholder including non-individuals. He holds a stake valued at over $2.6 billion. I am skeptical of Lululemon’s attempts at distancing themselves from their founder when he holds clear financial power over them. With such a high stake in the company, much of the money Lululemon gets from their Duke partnership will go toward making this billionaire richer. That is reason enough to either remove or boycott the store.When evaluating this decision by the administration, I try not to attribute to maliciousness what could be attributed to incompetence. Duke could have been unaware of the laundry list of ethical issues tied to Lululemon. This would be an embarrassment as all this information is easily accessible and would constitute a remarkable failure by the administration in not doing basic due diligence before entering a financial partnership.If Duke was aware of these glaring issues, however, I am mortified that a deeply ingrained culture of exclusion, misogyny and unethical labor practices is less important than profit margins. It is morally reprehensible that increased revenue at the University Store warrants welcoming this company onto campus in the face of such clear affronts to Duke’s values.The obvious next step is to immediately break the deal that brought Lululemon to campus. If Duke wants to even pretend that they care about inclusion and equity, following through with the deal is a non-starter. I hope Duke will recognize the sunk costs from this mistake are their burden to bear, and a burden that a wealthy institution can certainly afford.Unfortunately, I’ve learned to lower my expectations for institutions when it comes to doing the right thing. I will instead request the bare minimum: President Price should issue an explanation for why Duke decided to enter this contract. The students are entitled to know the thought process that led to such a flawed decision.Additionally, Duke should solicit student input for future contracts, such as by putting together a selection of five possible options and polling students. We deserve space to provide input, not just criticisms of decisions we weren’t involved in.For students, I propose an easy action plan: boycott the Lululemon store. A lot of us probably weren’t going to shop there anyways, ethics aside. We were fine with no Lululemon store last year. By making zero change to our spending habits, we can organize the simplest boycott ever. Collective action is the most practical tool at our disposal to push Duke to elevate the standards they use in making these decisions. And enacting change aside, I simply don’t want any of my money going to Chip Wilson.I believe the student body values inclusivity and mutual respect. When a company like Lululemon enters our community, they do so in opposition to those values. We should expect companies brought in by administration to adhere to the same ethical standards to which administration holds its students. That’s the critical point: Duke is a school, but beyond that Duke is a community, and communities are built on shared values that we all commit to upholding. Today, Duke has failed that commitment. Tomorrow must be different.Felix Jones is a Trinity senior.

The courage to be curious,Luke A. Powery,2024-09-09T12:00:00Z,Sep,9,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/090924-powery-courage-be-curious-20240909.html,"Discovery is one of Duke University’s five stated values. This suggests there are insights and information across the various academic disciplines that we do not yet know. Engaging in research at a major university like Duke is a key mechanism for discovery. Having to do research implies that one doesn’t have all of the information but desires to learn more. The practice of research in any field is a way of saying, “I don’t know, but I want to know.” This is wisdom that stretches back millennia to the writing of the Bible, when the Apostle Paul was describing a mystical experience and conveyed the limits of his understanding of it by repeating, “I do not know” (2 Corinthians 12:2-3). How about that, Dukies? There is something so honest and true about that statement — “I do not know” — even at a major research university. “I don’t know” is where we begin, and then we move on to the questions that can lead to discovery: Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?Often in doing research, framing a relevant question is critical, because the questions we ask shape the answers we receive, so one’s research question is vital in charting a pathway toward discovery. To raise a question means we don’t have all the answers, but it also means that we are curious. It is a sign of intellectual humility. As time goes on, as some have said, the more you know, the more you realize how much you don’t know. At a university with a value of discovery, questioning is at the heart of the academic quest. It’s also fundamental to the spiritual quest as I explored in my book of reflections, ""Living the Questions of the Bible."" We don’t just ask questions; our sacred texts do as well, literally. Questions point to the unknown, the unresolved, the unchartered territories and the unmarked roads. In spirituality or lived faith, there is also an invitation to embrace the practice of questioning and not always feeling as if we have to provide final answers. By approaching the academic and spiritual quests in this manner, we cultivate the courage to be curious. My deceased mentor and former Vanderbilt University professor Dale Andrews was known to say, ""I have more questions than answers, more problems than solutions. For this, I give God praise.” Professor Andrews not only inhabited a land of disequilibrium, uncertainty and incomprehensibility, but he expressed gratitude for it. He recognized the reality of human life and its creative tensions. He claimed the questions, and as a professor, he surely pursued research to discover answers to his queries. He was honest about not knowing and was courageous enough not to have to live with an attitude of certitude. He demonstrated what is key to human life and academic endeavors: questions.In ""Letters to a Young Poet,"" Rainer Maria Rilke wrote this to his nineteen-year-old protégé: “Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.”As you seek to discover through research and daily life, I hope you have more questions to live than answers to give.The Rev.

Duke must do more to protect student voting rights,"Olivia Schramkowski, Gunther Peck, Amaia Clayton",2024-09-05T14:00:00Z,Sep,5,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/090524-schramkowski-clayton-peck-duke-must-protect-voting-rights-20240905.html,"As we head into the days before one of the most consequential elections in history, North Carolina stands as a highly contested battleground state. However, with the implementation of new voting procedures at Duke, the chance that students at this university can fully exercise their right to vote is at risk.This past spring, we, and participants of PUBPOL 307, authored a report, “The State of Youth Voting Rights at Duke University,” analyzing how student voting rights were impacted by the new Duke Voter ID Card in the March 2024 primary. The results were striking. Across North Carolina, 52% of provisional ballots — ballots given to voters when there are problems verifying their voter registration when voting — were ultimately thrown out. In Durham County, this figure was 37%. Yet, among Duke students, 61.7% of provisional ballots cast were not counted. One out of eight Duke students casting ballots in the primary had their ballots rejected.The cause of this alarming number is Duke’s creation of the Duke Voter ID, which was forced upon the administration by new voter ID laws in North Carolina. With recent changes, Duke is no longer issuing the Duke Student Voter ID for undergrads. As a replacement, the university has begun issuing new DukeCards with expiration dates that have recently been accepted by the North Carolina Board of Elections, beginning with this year’s freshman class. However, because the burden remains on Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors to go to the DukeCard office to print physical cards, we anticipate that this opt-in approach will continue to disenfranchise Duke students as happened in the spring primary. To be clear — while the cards the freshmen class of 2028 received at orientation were approved by the NC Board of Elections, the digital Duke ID is NOT eligible to be used as identification or proof of address when registering to vote or voting as they lack the expiration date requested by the BOE. Although UNC’s application for digital ID was recently approved, Duke did not meet the explicit standards for a digital university ID that the BOE required. According to administrators from the Durham County BOE and Duke, a numbered memo from the NCBOE in 2023 demonstrates that the old ID given to juniors and seniors has been grandfathered in as an acceptable voter ID, even though it does not have an expiration date. However, as we document in our report, poll workers at Karsh abruptly stopped accepting old physical Duke IDs — as well as digital IDs — without expiration dates during the primary, after initially accepting them. Because of these inconsistent election administration practices, we recommend that all Duke students request the new DukeCard with the expiration date. Duke has pledged to print new DukeCards to any student who goes by the Card office and requests one. The problem with this opt-in approach, however, is that it places the burden on current students to secure an ID before they decide where and when they might register to vote in North Carolina. If there are lines waiting to get a new DukeCard this fall — or if the DukeCard office is closed when a student decides to register and to vote during early voting at the Karsh Alumni Center — Duke sophomores, juniors and seniors face the very real prospect of not having the correct ID required by the NCBOE and being disfranchised with a provisional ballot.During the research of our report, we found through one of our surveys that one out of five Duke students experienced challenges during early voting in the Spring because of complications with the photo ID requirements. Most of the Duke students who received provisional ballots attempted to use their digital Duke IDs when registering to vote. But those IDs were rejected. Additionally, we found that many of the Duke students casting provisional ballots had applied for the physical Duke photo ID card, but they were unable to pick up their cards because the Voter ID Card pickup was open sporadically and at specific times. To avoid such access problems in this fall’s election, when student turnout will be much higher, we urge Duke administrators to adopt an opt-out rather than an opt-in approach to student voting cards. Currently on the DukeCard website, students would need to fill out an application form in order to make an appointment with the DukeCard office. If past elections are a guide, more than 3,000 sophomores, juniors and seniors would potentially need to make these appointments, many of them during early voting. This creates an administrative bottleneck that is unnecessary and would hurt student voting rights. If the DukeCard office printed the new DukeCards preemptively, there would be no delays in getting the key ID students need to prove their residency and to vote in Durham, and less likelihood that they will end up casting provisional ballots. The new DukeCards should be distributed to undergraduates before early voting begins on October 17th. In addition, the DukeCard office should be open extra hours throughout the days of early voting so that students who lose their physical IDs can get a replacement when the polls are open.We know it was never Duke’s intention to prevent students from voting. However, due to miscommunication about which IDs count, the voting situation on Duke’s campus remains confusing. As students who want to believe that our university values our opinions, we hope that Duke can do better. Furthermore, as a faculty member who has joyfully collaborated with Duke administrators to secure youth voting rights in the past, I know that Duke can do better. We are asking Duke administrators to protect the legacy of student voting rights in its centennial by printing out the correct DukeCard for every eligible student without requiring students to request the ID in a separate trip to the Card office.

The article is updated to reflect that the original physical DukeCards given to juniors and seniors do qualify as valid voter IDs according to Duke and local county BOE administrators.

Wrong about me and wrongheaded about Duke,Doriane Coleman,2024-09-04T12:00:00Z,Sep,4,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/090424-coleman-wrong-about-me-20240904.html,"I’m writing to respond to a guest column The Chronicle published on August 26 titled “Duke University faculty must stop advocating for anti-gay and anti-transgender laws.” This title is misleading. As The Chronicle’s hyperlink “taylor-coleman-trans-rights” makes clear, the essay isn’t about generic “faculty” — it’s about me. I’m responding because it’s wrong about me and my work, and wrongheaded in its institutional message.I encourage you to read the column for yourself, but the bottom line is this. Its author argues that I’m partly to blame for all that’s gone wrong globally for trans people in sports and beyond: The column claims that the “roots” of the “ongoing controversy surrounding Algerian boxer Imane Khelif at the 2024 Paris Olympics” can be “partly trac[ed] back” to me. The “origins” of “the recent surge of anti-transgender sports bills” — that’s partly me too, it claims. Indeed, according to the column, my “work contributes to a nationwide wave of legislation not only banning transgender athletes but also restricting trans medical care and imposing bathroom bills.” Before me, anti-trans activity was “declining.” After me, it has “skyrocketed.” Duke is also in the wrong, albeit by proxy, because it employs and even “support[s] and award[s]” me rather than firing me or formally disavowing my work: “This support” itself “has global repercussions,” the column contends. Its takeaway is that Duke shouldn’t tolerate influential faculty whose work isn’t politically palatable — in this case to the author and her allies.It’s one thing to disagree on a point of policy, but at least in a university, disagreement should be informed, accurate and respectful. I take the author, an alumna, to be part of its extended community. From the top of the column, it’s plain these standards weren’t met.I’ve never advocated for laws that could be described as anti-gay, as its title implies. Conspicuously absent is any mention of my new book,“On Sex and Gender – A Commonsense Approach.” If you read it, you’ll see I’ve done exactly the opposite.I’ve never advocated for anti-trans laws. To the contrary, I’m in favor of trans rights, just not by way of denying sex. As I explain in “On Sex and Gender,” it doesn’t have to be either/or. I believe we can hold onto both.Contrary to what the column implies, I’ve not “contribute[d]” to “restricting trans medical care and imposing bathroom bills.” In fact, I’ve argued for trans people being able to usethe restroom that aligns with their gender identity and for access to gender affirming care.Although a correction has been issued, the original version of the column claimed falsely that I gave a testimony to the House of Representatives as a guest of Marco Rubio. I’ve never been Marco Rubio’s guest for anything, and I’ve never done anything for his office. Anyway, senators don’t get to invite witnesses to testify in the House of Representatives.I have testified in the House in favor of continuing the Title IX carve-out, on the books since 1975, that allows for separate sex sports. I’m an athlete. I come to this not only with years of experience on the track and in sports policymaking roles, but also with a lifelong commitment to resisting measures that either directly or indirectly deprive women of opportunities because they’re female. Still, contra the GOP, I simultaneouslyencouraged Congress to find ways to protect trans rights that don’t make us collateral damage. About this two-pronged approach, I’m not just “polite sounding” nor am I “dishonest.” My point, which was the basis for my book, is that both sex and gender matter so it shouldn’t be just one (per the far-right) or the other (per the column's author and advocates aligned with her).As the author’s own source makes clear, the claim that Quillette, a publication I sometimes write for, supports phrenology — the long-debunked, pseudoscientific theory that the shape of our skulls can tell us something about our personality and aptitudes — requires a redefinition of the word and a lot of steps to defend. Kevin Drum of Mother Jones called these leaps “wildly unfair.” Describing Quillette as “right wing” is also misleading. Consistent with its heterodox mission, Quillette isn’t easily pegged. It features long-form essays by public intellectuals from across the political spectrum. Some are libertarian or conservative, and some — like me — are not.There is “concrete evidence” — not just “speculations around IOC language” — supporting a reasonable belief that the boxers whose inclusion in female competition at the Olympics caused controversy are biologically male. This evidence includes genetic test results from two accredited laboratories, in Istanbul and New Delhi, indicating an XY chromosomal complement; statements from the IOC indicating they may have correspondingly high testosterone levels; and, at least for one, statements from her trainer —a renowned sports scientist— that a second opinion from a private endocrinologist confirmed the original lab results — and that she’s been suppressing her T levels since. The IOC acknowledged receiving the original results and it didn’t challenge the laboratories’ work; rather, as its spokesperson explained, the organization’s reasons for not “dealing with” them were ethical and procedural: “Partly confidentiality. Partly medical issues. Partly that there was no basis for the test in the first place. And partly that sharing this data is also very much against the rules, international rules.” The scientists who co-authored the Consensus Statement for the American College of Sports Medicine on“The Biological Basis of Sex Differences in Athletic Performance” are confident in their findings. Anyone who works in the hard sciences knows that the concluding disclaimer “more research is needed” is standard protocol.As the abundance of gender diverse female athletes competing and thriving in elite female sports makes clear, sorting trans athletes the same way all other athletes are sorted — by sex — isn’t the equivalent of “den[ying]” them the benefits that flow from elite sports. The fact that some but not all trans women and girls would prefer to compete in the female category where they have an advantage is just that — a preference.I’m not against transgender girls being included on girls’ school sports teams. I haven’t “change[d]” or “rejected” my “original position.” As the dedicated section in “On Sex and Gender” makes clear, my position on school sports — which is different from my position on elite sports — remains the same as when I co-authoredthis op-ed arguing against North Carolina’s unnecessarily exclusionary legislation. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, read my essay inThe Washington Post for yourself: I was correcting misleading statements about the state of the scientific evidence that should inform law and policy.Finally, GOP politicians have sometimes cited my work, but I’ve not influenced their policy positions. A careful read will show that they typically cite me for the basics about human biology and for my summaries of competition results, both of which are readily available from other sources. Affiliated politicians have also sometimes sought to capitalize on the fact that I’m a liberal and a feminist to make the point that their position on sports isn’t a partisan proposition. This is simply a fact, repeatedly confirmed by national surveys. The truth is that the vote-getting appeal of girls’ and women’s sports — and frankly the disruptiveness of sex denial — is why GOP politicians latched onto the issue, well before they’d ever heard of me and my work.Now to where this is coming from and to what’s wrongheaded about the column's central message.In the last six months, through a member of the university faculty and in concert with at least one other alumna, the column's author pursued a course of action — over email — designed to get me to take down my work, to disavow it and to embrace their political cause. They say that my “advocacy for discrimination” — meaning my view that it sometimes makes sense to distinguish sex from gender — “poses a significant threat to trans rights, women’s rights and human rights.” When their insistence escalated into an actual threat — comply or else “our next step is to release and publicize a petition” to pressure me to do so — I reported them to the university. The errors in the column – like others they make that falsely claim I’ve testified before legislatures I’ve never encountered and wrote briefs in cases in which I’ve had no role — suggest the facts matter less than that a policy position with which they disagree is sometimes articulated by thoughtful people and platformed in thoughtful places.They’re wrong on both counts. Facts always matter. And the column's thesis — that Duke shouldn’t tolerate, support or promote faculty who don’t toe a certain political line — has no place in a thriving university.The questions I work on, including how the law should define ‘sex’ and whether it should go from being smart about it to blind to it, are among the important issues of the day. Because of this, they’re being debated at every level and in every branch of government, as well as in the two presidential campaigns. Universities are exactly where issues of such import should be carefully examined. We have the disciplinary tools, the training, the time and the temperament to do this work well, meaning in depth and taking different perspectives into account. This is especially important in a context like sex and gender, where the solutions will touch everyone’s lives in one way or another. In a very real sense, doing this work is why universities exist.And yes, we should be polite — not “polite sounding” but actually polite — as we do our jobs. I’m using the word “polite” according to the Oxford Dictionaries via Google, as “having or showing behavior that is respectful and considerate of other people.” “Polite” characterizes “civil discourse” which — claims to the contrary notwithstanding — isn’t a conservative commitment. It’s also the opposite of “dangerous.” Mutual respect and consideration are essential for well-functioning institutions. Good on Duke for being one of them.Doriane Coleman is the Thomas L.

Have the news media learned to cover a female presidential candidate? Democracy’s future may depend on the answer,"Philip M. Napoli, Talia Goodman",2024-09-03T12:00:00Z,Sep,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/090324-napoli-goodman-cover-female-president-20240903.html,"This summer, the 2024 presidential election received a monumental shake-up when President Joe Biden withdrew his bid for re-election and threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris quickly amassed the delegate support necessary to secure the Democratic nomination. Harris follows in the footsteps of Hillary Rodham Clinton as only the second female major party nominee for the presidency. If we learned one thing from the first go-round with candidate Clinton, it is that the news media have much to learn about how to fairly and properly cover a female presidential candidate. There is a well-established pattern of American news media allowing gender bias to seep into their coverage of female politicians. We know, for instance, that journalists are more likely to ask female candidates about their domestic life (e.g., parenthood, marriage) than male candidates. We know that journalists are more likely to question the emotional state of female candidates and that they are more likely to focus on the appearance and voice of female candidates. While these might seem like superficial differences in coverage, research has shown that they can negatively affect voters’ perceptions of the favorability of female candidates and their likelihood of voting for a female candidate. Reflecting these patterns, when Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2016, research found that her physical appearance received significantly more news media attention than Trump’s and that her domestic life received considerably more attention than Trump’s. The news media also tended to focus more on the “likability” question in relation to Clinton than Trump. When Clinton addressed her gender, the media accused her of 'playing the victim' of sexism, whereas when Trump addressed his masculinity, he was portrayed as a powerful father figure naturally suited for an office.Again, such differences in coverage can affect voter behavior. And in a political environment like ours, in which national elections are often decided by razor-thin margins, such differences can potentially affect an election outcome. Also, campaign strategists are aware of these tendencies and can often work to exploit them. So it is no surprise that we’ve seen the Trump campaign and Trump supporters try to focus attention on subjects like Kamala Harris’ laugh, her prior romantic relationships, and the fact that she has no biological children. Campaign strategists know full well that such attacks cater to inherent biases in how the news media cover female candidates. And so, campaign attacks can help to generate biased news stories. As the economics of the news media have continued to deteriorate, news outlets may be even more susceptible to amplifying the campaign narratives put forth by political strategists, as well as those that go viral on social media.Early indicators do raise concerns about the news media’s performance covering Kamala Harris so far. According to a recent analysis by media critic Margaret Sullivan, the news media seem to already be falling into the same “predictable blunders” when it comes to covering Kamala Harris. Media coverage of all candidates should be critical but fair. Media coverage infused with gender bias is not fair. In this election, the consequences of such biased coverage could be the election of a candidate who has promised to dismantle some of the very foundations of our democracy. The burden of responsibility on the news media to get their coverage right has never been greater. As Kamala Harris takes her next steps as the Democratic nominee, the news media's ability to provide unbiased coverage will be a litmus test for how far we've come — or how far we have yet to go — in achieving gender equality in politics. However, it is not only incumbent on the news media to do a better job this time around in covering a female presidential candidate. It is also incumbent on all of us, as critical news consumers and citizens, to be cognizant of such biases when we see them and to not let them have undue influence over our candidate perceptions or our voting behaviors. The future of American democracy could literally hang in the balance.Philip M. Napoli is the James R.

Listening to flat-earthers,Nik Narain,2024-08-31T12:00:00Z,Aug,31,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/083124-narain-listening-to-flat-earthers-20240831.html,"In elementary school, one of my favorite pastimes was to memorize world capitals. I’d spin the globe in my first-grade teacher’s classroom and point to countries around the world to see if I remembered the differences between Budapest and Bucharest, Tokyo and Kyoto, Macedonia and Mauritania.But, therein lies the problem: that I was spinning a globe. A spherical globe meant to model the “correct” shape of the earth. And why did I say — why was I taught to say — around the world? Why, from such a young age, was I indoctrinated into the ideology that claimed the Earth was round, rather than the true geomorphic tortilla (or tortilloid) on which civilization has flourished for centuries?Earth’s spherical geometry has been settled since the third century B.C.E. by ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle who obtained empirical evidence after traveling to Egypt and seeing new constellations of stars. Eratosthenes, in the third century BC, became the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth, with further geometric calculations performed by Islamic scholars in later centuries. Images from space were final proof in the late 1940s.The notion of flat earth can be traced to the 19th century English writer Samuel Rowbotham, who wrote under the name Parallax, which sounds kind of like a digestive medication. Rowbotham’s observations on a six-mile straight-line stretch of the Bedford River led him to believe the Earth was actually flat, and he spent the rest of his life investigating and arguing the case. In his 1865 book ""Zetetic Astronomy: Earth Not a Globe,"" Rowbotham models the Earth as a flat disc centered at the North Pole with the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars moving only several thousand miles above the surface of the Earth. Formed around his views, the Universal Zetetic Society waned in popularity during the world wars, and eventually made a resurgence as the International Flat Earth Society by Samuel Shenton in 1956 as a small group of fringe conspiracists. Following Shenton’s death in 1972, the International Flat Earth Society was taken over by Charles Kenneth Johnson, who was credited by Smithsonian magazine writer Danny Lewis to have transformed the group into an organization of thousands of members, at one point consisting of 3,500 people.When the Internet took off in the 2000s, Flat Earth found a new platform on YouTube, which is where the majority of today’s Flat Earthers began their journey through channels and podcasts ""debunking"" claims of scientism and biblical literalism. Flat Earth subcultures have given rise to multiple theories of Earth’s geometries, from Rowbotham’s icy disk, to Earth being flat but encompassed in a Truman Show-esque snowglobe from which nothing can fall off the edges. Some Flat Earthers also reject gravity and distrust scientists and scientific institutions, especially NASA, who many believe to be part of a larger conspiracy of paid actors and falsified images. Many Flat Earthers often believe in other conspiracies too, like the moon landing being faked. ""If the Earth is round, how can I see skyscrapers in the distance?"" ""If I live in Australia, how come I’m not standing upside down?"" ""Why are all the close-up pictures of earth in space flat?"" Online forums have made it possible for Flat Earthers to congregate in person for these discussions at international conferences since 2009; the one in 2018 was hosted right here in the Triangle. Flat Earth has even received multiple celebrity endorsements, such as NBA player Kyrie Irving (though he later apologized) and rapper B.o.B., who began a GoFundMe in 2017 to raise 200,000 to launch interstellar satellites to ""find the curve."" It’s easy for most of us to laugh at such claims, but such derision is only part of the problem. According to Asheley Landrum, a psychologist at Texas Tech who studies scientific misinformation, Flat Earthers are ""very sincere in their beliefs,"" and are not building these communities out of farce. She says that Flat Earthers aren’t necessarily people who don’t believe in science, and are often in support of the scientific method. ""It’s not really an education thing…it really is about distrusting authorities and institutions.""On a 2021 nationwide survey, around 10 percent of respondents agreed with conspiracy claims that the Earth is flat and NASA faked the Moon landings. Although flat earth beliefs are inherently benign — after all, they’re not hurting anyone — it does highlight just how broken trust is between science and the public. Although science ideally is not an ideology by definition, we now no longer live in the world where we can take science as fact detached from politicization and/or media sensationalization. Flat Earth culture further highlights the power of algorithms for normalizing conspiratorial views and how we can cherry-pick and narrativize evidence to see the universe exactlyhow we want to. Finally, Flat Earth demonstrates the power of community in reinforcing one’s beliefs and how the feelings of belonging and camaraderie in a belief system can be as important as the beliefs themselves.Bandwagons are the most convenient form of philosophical mobility. An echo chamber is much more mellifluous than a battleground of contradictory information. Fortunately and unfortunately, media-based solutions are almost always additive: we cannot take away flat earth content, but we can generate content demonstrating the evidence for a spherical earth and hope the algorithm™ catches on. We can also advocate for changes in algorithms on YouTube or Instagram to diversify its suggestions for future content. For now, I’d say it’s best if we stop laughing and start listening. It is near impossible to change someone's views instantaneously, but hate and ridicule won’t get anyone anywhere. Nik Narain is a Trinity senior. His pieces typically run on alternate Saturdays."
Hillel is a welcoming place for all Jewish students,Zachary Patterson,2024-08-30T12:00:00Z,Aug,30,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/083024-patterson-hillel-is-welcoming-20240830.html,"Jewish Life at Duke (JLD; Duke University’s Hillel) has been foundational to my past two years at this University. I have come to love Jewish Life at Duke for its commitment to supporting all students in developing their Jewish identity as well as creating an environment for open discourse on all things Jewish. Last year, I served on the Hillel International Student Cabinet; this year, I am its co-chair, and in that role, serve on the Hillel International Board of Directors. As a student heavily involved in American Jewish life, I have both a local and national perspective about how the Jewish community has been working to support Jewish students since October 7th. In this article, I share my perspective in a personal capacity.This past year, the Jewish community at Duke has faced unprecedented challenges in exploring thoughtful dialogue around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The massacre of 1,200 Israelis committed by Hamas — a U.S. and E.U.-designated terrorist organization — on Oct. 7, 2023, and a subsequent intensive Israeli military response that has left thousands dead in the Gaza Strip, have understandably inflamed the Duke community on all sides. Throughout an ugly year of discourse, I have seen both Hillel International and Jewish Life at Duke maintain their commitment to serving all Jewish students while simultaneously remaining proudly Zionist organizations.While some may say it is not possible to serve all Jewish students and be a Zionist organization, it is essential to understand why Hillels function with these guidelines and how they manage to achieve both of these goals.First and foremost, the word “Zionist” has become a flashpoint, with people on our campus defining the word in many different ways. For the majority of American Jews, ""Zionism"" is the belief that the Jewish people have the right to a free and democratic state in Israel, the homeland and spiritual center of the Jewish people for more than 3,000 years. This means that anti-Zionism is the movement against granting Jewish people statehood. While there have been many different discussions on what form Zionism would take over the past millennia, there is one glaring reality that must be addressed.Since Zionism became a reality with the creation of the modern state of Israel in 1948, the dichotomy of Zionism vs. Anti-Zionism is misleading today. Israel is no longer an abstract concept, but rather a modern nation.An anti-Zionist Jew who feels that Hillels should disregard or reject Israel’s legitimacy in the world fails to understand the current state of Israel. Contrary to questions like Catalonian independence from Spain, or Kurdish nationalism, Israel’s existence is not an open question for critical discourse in academic spaces. Rather, Israel is a highly functional country in the Middle East that, since its rebirth as a modern nation 76 years ago, has existed as a conventionally and internationally recognized state. Israel is home to almost half of the world’s Jewish population who live and thrive in the region. Israel is also home to a 20% Arab population that, while facing relevant discrimination, receives the same rights as all other Israeli citizens. Like other countries, Israel provides schooling, health care, and social services. Israel has democratically elected mayors and Knesset (parliament) members who are accountable to their citizens. Most importantly, the citizens of Israel, Arab and Jewish, live established lives finding meaning in the place they are from. Israelis share an identity, a nationality, and a sense of self. Israel exists today and is a Jewish majority nation within its internationally recognized borders. Israel is a home to the many people that live there. Israel is not an idea, but a nation with real responsibilities that would be expected from any democratic government. It is entitled to the same legitimacy as any other country. Does Israel’s legitimacy invalidate Palestinian efforts for sovereignty — of course not. Does Israel face serious problems that should be discussed and debated — absolutely it does.Thus, when people and political leaders have serious disagreements with Israeli policy, their dialogue should be focused on addressing these serious issues, rather than dubious claims that the country simply should not exist. Hillels across the country recognize that their job is not to be a forum on which to discuss the destruction of nation states. Rather, Hillel’s mandate is to promote open discourse on Israeli politics, culture, and the foundational problems that Israel faces. All of these topics have been and continue to be discussed in the more than 20+ events Jewish Life at Duke has hosted or sponsored in the past year on the topic of Israel. Yet, even while Hillel International cannot platform an advocate for the destruction of Israel, they still will open their doors to every Jewish student — no matter their opinions. Hillel’s policy on student participation within the Israel guidelines states, ""We encourage students’ inquiry as they explore their relationship with Israel. We object to labeling, excluding, or harassing any students for their beliefs and expressions thereof.""Thus, if an anti-Zionist Jew personally feels no connection to Israel, that is their prerogative. They can still attend any Jewish event they please. A beautiful part of the diversity of Jewish life on campus is that there are many events to choose from, created for people with all different opinions, religious, and cultural backgrounds. I attend many events hosted by JLD (or by JLD sponsored clubs) where the speaker does not match my ideologies. This programming is a part of functional, but respectful discourse. There is still a key difference between events that platform a diversity of opinions about Israel versus events that legitimize discourse on the destruction of Israel. With the former, I will likely walk out of it saying, ""Oh, I disagree with that stance."" With the latter, I will likely walk out thinking, ""Oh, that person thinks the culture and life of the one Jewish state should be destroyed.""It has been my experience that Jewish Life at Duke is committed to supporting each student in their Jewish journey. From diverse, wide-ranging, and challenging conversations about the current war and the Israel-Palestine conflict, to the many programs that shine a light on the diversity of the Jewish community, I see JLD - and Hillels - opening their doors to all Jewish students. If you are a Jewish student who feels that you do not have a home at Duke, I encourage you to visit Jewish Life at Duke and see all that it has to offer.

What’s so great about democracy?,Walter Sinnott-Armstrong,2024-08-29T12:00:00Z,Aug,29,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/082924-sinnott-armstrong-whats-great-about-democracy-20240829.html,"Plato ranked democracy as the lowest form of ordered government. Hitler gained power through democratic processes. The majority of voters in the United States at one time supported slavery. With this tainted history, why do so many people fear what they call undemocratic? Democracy is, perhaps, not at its best in crises when a government needs to move quickly to avert a catastrophe, such as climate change. It might be too slow and messy for emergencies in wars and epidemics. In more normal circumstances, however, democracy helps to forestall very bad mistakes. Its main benefit is then not to gain the best but to avoid the worst.In particular, democracy reduces the risk of violent revolution. When leaders are elected, the majority favors them and most of their policies, at least initially. If they later adopt undesirable policies, those who could vote see themselves as responsible for giving their leaders power. They also know that they will get a chance to remove their leaders without resorting to violence, if they can convince other voters in the next election. Admittedly, there have been violent rebellions in democracies, such as the U.S. Civil War, but they are less common than in monarchies and oligarchies.Democracy also reduces aggressive wars. Democracies do fight fiercely to defend themselves and their allies, but they tend not to start offensive wars. The reason seems simple: most citizens are reluctant to go to war unless necessary, if only because they do not want themselves or their family or friends to be injured. Military destruction harms most voters, so true democracies throughout history have rarely attacked their neighbors without provocation. In addition, democracy fuels moderation. In dictatorships and monarchies, activists need to convince only one person — the dictator or monarch — in order to convert the whole government to a radical ideology that is shared by only a few people at one extreme end of a political spectrum. When political power is spread among only a few oligarchs, it is still relatively easy to persuade enough of them to become zealots. But when all citizens get to vote, extremists need to convince a much larger number of people, most of whom have common sense and share values that speak against extreme positions. If an extreme liberal runs against a moderate liberal in a general election, the moderate candidate’s position is closer to the views of most people, so the moderate is more likely to win. The same goes for an extreme versus a moderate conservative. And even though extremists sometimes win, more moderate elected officials can then exercise checks and balances to keep the extremists from going too far. Admittedly, moderation is not always better than extremism, and some widely-shared views (such as support for civil rights) have been mislabelled “extreme” by their opponents. Nonetheless, radical policies that only a few people support are often dangerous, partly because their effects are unknown. Democracy helps to reduce these dangers.Wait a minute! The United States today is a democracy, isn’t it? Aren’t extremists getting elected today in the United States? Isn’t there some risk of rebellion today in the US? Yes, but why? The answer is complex, but one part seems to be non-democratic features of the current U.S. government, including gerrymandering and voting restrictions (which undermine equal votes for all), the Senate and the electoral college (which give more power to people from small states), the Supreme Court (which calls corporations people and allows the rich to buy elections) and widespread misinformation and deep fakes (which prevent citizens from voting for candidates whose policies they really prefer). The sad fact that democracy can be weakened in these and other ways does not show that democracy is no good when it is done right.This argument for democracy — as the best way to avoid the worst outcomes — should appeal to conservatives, because reluctance to change tradition is basic to conservatism, as it has usually been understood. That reluctance stems from a fear that quick radical change is likely to be very harmful. Democracy helps to avoid precisely the kinds of costly mistakes that conservatives fear. The same argument should also appeal to liberals and progressives, because the worst-off in society are usually the ones who get sacrificed when dictators, monarchs and oligarchs gain power. The poor are forced to fight in wars, while the rich stay at home and make money from arms sales. When industries suddenly die out, workers lose their jobs and often lack training to find new ones, but owners can quickly sell their stock and invest in new businesses. In such ways, the poor and powerless predictably pay the price for quick changes, so they benefit when democracy slows things down. Liberals, progressives and others should like that.For these reasons, I hope that both sides of the political spectrum can agree that democracy is valuable and worth fighting for. Undemocratic policies are simply too dangerous.Walter Sinnott-Armstrong is the Chauncey Stillman Professor of Practical Ethics in the Department of Philosophy and the Kenan Institute for Ethics.

A note to international students,Alistar Erickson-Ludwig,2024-08-28T12:00:00Z,Aug,28,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/082824-erickson-ludwig-a-note-to-international-students-20240828.html,"A student once told me that the hardest thing she had to do upon arriving in the U.S. was ordering at Subway. ""Like the sandwich shop?"" I asked. Perhaps I paused too long or she could see it on my face that I didn’t quite understand what she meant. She went on to explain that you have to go down the line very quickly and state exactly what you’d like. There was no mobile ordering at the time! The challenge, I quickly realized, was that vegetables below in the refrigerated display case aren’t labeled and ingredients like banana peppers aren’t common throughout the world. And dressings? Thousand Island? Garlic aioli or Smoky BBQ? These are not common in language textbooks or even in American TV shows. No doubt as you thought about joining Duke, you pictured images of the Chapel, Duke Gardens, listening to music with new friends in your dorm, the energy in Cameron or the spiritual feeling you can’t help but notice when the organ is playing in Duke Chapel. What you probably did not think about is feeling out of place, confused or maybe even that Duke is the wrong fit. Feelings like these are completely normal. Too often, we keep these feelings hidden because we don’t want to appear weak — or, because we’ve worked so so hard to get here, we feel like we should be grateful and just ""keep it together"" for the sake of other people. Don’t do that. YOU and your feelings matter. Among the graduate students I work with, no one is going to walk through the cafeteria proclaiming loudly how they can’t get an interview for a job. No one is sending chats on the group text that they’re having trouble focusing on studying. Or that they didn’t do as well as they wanted on the homework assignment that they really enjoyed doing. Or that they expected to make really good friends instantly and they feel lonely. So just because you don’t see those things, it doesn’t mean your peers are thriving and you are not. Do not pretend everyone has their lives together and that imposter syndrome is not here. Instead, acknowledge it and try hard not to perpetuate it. A computer science class might not come easily to you but maybe French does. Or perhaps you cannot easily keep up with the Zumba moves in your gym class, but maybe you are a loyal friend. Maybe you haven’t had a chance to showcase your ability to cook curry, or have the time to get back to playing the guitar, or you left your painting supplies at home. Maybe it’s not about the skills you have or don’t have but maybe it’s your passion, inspiration, and dedication to learning. As obvious as it might be, remember you are good at many many things. You are at Duke to learn. You aren’t here simply to take a test and prove you are good at taking tests. You’re here to grow as a person. If you need a reminder, talk to your parents, friends or re-read your application. Another useful exercise is starting a gratitude journal. Simply write down a sentence or two each day about what you’re grateful for or what brought joy. Maybe it is a grade in a class, a new friend, but maybe it’s that you remembered to leave your apartment with an umbrella before the rain started. If you are a new student to Duke and haven’t spent much time in the United States, please give yourself time and self-compassion. Adjustment isn’t meant to happen instantly. Change can be both exciting and hard at the same time. You’re in a new physical space, among new people and in a new academic environment. That’s a lot of things to learn and adapt to! Ask for help even about small things. A great simple conversation starter can simply be, ""Hi, I’ve never eaten at this restaurant before. Have you? What would you recommend? Or what are you feeling about the first few weeks of this class?""If you’re looking to have a meaningful conversation, try to ask something that isn’t just yes or no as an answer. It may sound hard at first, but if someone asks, “Hey, how are you?”, try not to always dismiss the question with an ""I’m fine."" Be honest and authentic. It’s ok to say ""today feels challenging."" Similarly, if today is a great day, say why, even if it’s small — ""I’m having a good day because I got a great study space at the library.""This will help you feel more grounded and connected to your new space and to the community you are meant to be a part of.

Virtues of democracy: An introductory column ,Brian Hare,2024-08-27T12:00:00Z,Aug,27,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/082724-hare-virtues-of-democracy-20240827.html,"Winston Churchill once stated, “democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried.” Only two decades ago, it seemed inevitable that most, if not all, governments would be modeled after liberal democracies. Today there is a democratic stagnation, or even recession. The United States, the cradle of representative democracy, was downgraded to a “flawed democracy” by the Economist in 2016. In 2022, the same Democratic Index only rated 8% of the world’s population as living in a “full democracy” while 37% live under autocratic rule (about 3 billion people).The slide may continue. Autocrats like Nicholas Maduro in Venezuela are preventing the birth of democracies by using violence against peaceful protestors and arresting opposition leaders. Nascent democracies are also being violently attacked. Myanmar’s military junta forcefully removed Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and her freely elected government in 2021, while Ukraine’s democratically elected government continues to bravely hold off Russia’s invasion. Even established democratic states across Europe are under threat, as right-wing nationalist parties that favor autocratic ruleare on the rise. Other democratic governments including India and Israel have seen democratic norms sharply erode while, on the heels of Hong Kong’s democratic collapse, Taiwan’s decades old democracy is increasingly under threat from China. Here in North Carolina, there are major concerns about both voter fraud and voter disenfranchisement. Some believe we need more protection against fraudulent ballots being cast. Others fear newly enacted NC voter fraud laws will only make it harder for young voters, and especially college students, to vote. Will democracy survive? Can it thrive? Will it get better on its own? As a citizen, why should we care and what role can we all play? A number of faculty and students from across the university have agreed to contribute to a column here in the Chronicle to help facilitate discussions on the virtues of democracy. All of our contributors have expertise in the areas they have volunteered to cover. They are from Trinity College and the Sanford School of Public Policy, and cover a wide range of disciplines: political science, philosophy, psychology, biology, anthropology and more. While our contributors bring diverse opinions and perspectives, they all share the common belief that exploring how democracy can be a powerful positive force in our world is vital to all our futures. As the reader you are also invited to participate. One or two pieces will run in this series each week. Students, faculty and alumni are invited to respond with their own opinions in the Chronicle, or you can just discuss with your fellow Blue Devils in class or on the quad. We look forward to an open discussion that itself is a celebration of democracy. Brian Hare is a Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology.

Don't hesitate to celebrate,Luke A. Powery,2024-08-26T12:00:00Z,Aug,26,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/082624-powery-dont-hesitate-to-celebrate-20240826.html,"In a severely impoverished community, in one of the largest shantytowns in Nairobi, Kenya, the Shangilia Children’s Home is an orphanage for formerly homeless children. Over twenty years ago, I was there with a group of pastors from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We sat in the courtyard as the children recited scripture, sang religious and cultural songs, played instruments, danced and performed other acrobatic tricks. The children repeated a phrase we hear in churches throughout the world — “God is good, all the time, and all the time, God is good.”At Shangilia, which means literally “to receive with joy and enthusiasm,” I observed an authentic expression of deep gladness when that should have been the last thing expected in this kind of situation. These little children smiled. They clapped. They had every reason to be sad, even mad or fearful, due to the socioeconomic and political context. Yet they celebrated.Celebrating may seem out of touch with “real life” with the ongoing injustices of war and innocent bloodshed, but a deep wisdom reveals otherwise. Poet Jack Gilbert says it this way: “We must risk delight. We can do without pleasure, but not delight. Not enjoyment. We must have the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless furnace of this world.”Gladness amid madness is what we see in the history of the fiery furnace of the enslavement of Black peoples. Anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston reminds us of this in her book “Sanctified Church” with its description of High John de Conqueror, a hero in African American folklore. High John was the embodiment of “a whisper, a will to hope.” He walked with a musical rhythm on a “singing-drum” or “the waves of sound.” “The sign of this man was a laugh, and his singing-symbol was a drum-beat.” He was the slaves’ “hope-bringer.” In one story about High John, there was a plantation where the work was extremely hard and the Old Massa (the master) was very mean. High John told everybody, “What we need is a song.” So, he, along with other slaves, went on a trip to search for a song without the master seeing them leave. They traveled to heaven where the Old Maker (God) called them to his “great workbench, and made them a tune and put it in their mouths. It had no words. It was a tune that you could bend and shape…” In other words, God gave them a song. And when they returned to the plantation, the master was in a horrible mood, but High John reminded the enslaved that they had something “finer than [the] plantation” within themselves. He said, “Us got all that, and [the master] don’t know nothing at all about it.” They broke out in singing, and “the day didn’t seem hot like it had before…[and] the work flew.”The story of High John reveals that celebration can be a form of secret resistance to the status quo or any form of oppression. In tough times throughout history, celebratory singing could be heard on the streets of Haiti after a devastating earthquake. Celebratory singing could be heard on the streets of Soweto, South Africa, as the people fought for freedom during apartheid. Celebratory singing could be heard in the streets of El Salvador as people suffered under the cruel hand of militarism.Celebration is not naïve. Celebration in moments of great suffering is not a disconnection from reality or an escape, but a connection to something so real that you can’t help but laugh, sing and smile. Gladness reveals the spring of life even amid death. Celebratory practices can be eudaimonic expressions of resistance to daily trauma and cruelty. Celebration can be a refusal to be buried by burdens, a mode of attunement to life, and an expression of gratitude for it. It can be a reminder that one should be grateful to be seen and not viewed.So as we begin a new academic year, I offer a humble challenge to the Duke community to find ways to celebrate. Don’t hesitate to do it. Don’t allow trauma and pain, which are surely real, to become a terror reigning over your life. There is more to life than lamentation. There is also celebration.Celebrate new friendships, new ideas, new experiences and new opportunities. Celebrate each new day. Celebrate with one another and celebrate one another. Laugh, sing, dance and shout. You are here. You are alive. Let’s celebrate that and so much more!The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel.

Duke University faculty must stop advocating for anti-gay and anti-transgender laws,Vivian Taylor,2024-08-26T12:00:00Z,Aug,26,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/082624-taylor-coleman-trans-rights-20240826.html,"The ongoing controversy surrounding Algerian boxer Imane Khelif at the 2024 Paris Olympics highlights a disturbing trend with roots tracing back to North Carolina. Khelif has become the latest victim of the nationwide and now global panic over trans women in sports. Despite being assigned female at birth, living her entire life as a girl and woman, and being legally recognized as a woman in her conservative home country, she faces widespread accusations of being transgender. This baseless claim has subjected Khelif to bullying and threats for no reason other than assumptions about her appearance and body.This story, along with the recent surge of anti-transgender sports bills, can partly find its origins in the Center for Sports Law and Policy at Duke Law School, led by Professor Doriane Coleman. During the Paris Olympics, Coleman published an article on the right-wing, phrenology-defending website Quillette specifically targeting Imane Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting. She heavily suggests — without any concrete evidence apart from speculations around IOC language — that the two boxers have XY chromosomes. In her piece, Coleman directly argues for banning transgender women and women with DSD from participating in women's sports, and implies that Khelif should be banned from women’s sports. Coleman wrote a follow up op-ed for The Washington Post on August 16th. In this article, she again implies that Imane Khelief has XY chromosomes.Coleman's advocacy for discrimination poses a significant threat to trans rights, women's rights and human rights in general.Coleman began advocating for anti-trans laws in 2019. Testifying before the U.S. House of Representatives, she called on Congress to remove protections for transgender women from the Equality Act — specifically, removing ""women with testes"" from ""Title IX and opportunities for girls and women in sport."" In her testimony, she laid out the benefits to girls and women of participating in sports beyond the physical, pointing out that those who participate in sports have better social and economic outcomes. She stated, “Girls who play sports stay in school longer, suffer fewer health problems, enter the labor force at higher rates, and are more likely to land better jobs… Our numbers in c-suites are notable, as are our contributions to public service.” Coleman never claims that it’s athletic prowess or physical speed that got these women into board rooms and elected office at a higher rate, but only that the experience of participating in sports is beneficial. In her recent piece for The Washington Post, she claims that elite sports exist ""to produce economic, political, developmental and health-related benefits for stakeholders and society."" While Coleman pays lip service to alternative ""avenues for transgender inclusion,"" she never lays out a specific way for what that might look like. In reality, trans girls and women would be denied those economic and social benefits. For example, she suggests that trans students be shunted into their own “open” or “nonbinary” category, which is an unworkable idea given the minuscule number of trans athletes. As of summer 2023 when North Carolina passed its own trans sports ban, there were about fifteen student trans athletes in the state, certainly not enough for a ""category."" And by Coleman’s own logic and evidence, trans girls who receive gender-affirming care are also disadvantaged compared to cis males, limiting their participation in men’s sports. As she wrote, ""The evidence also shows that trans women who are competitive athletes and who’ve taken feminizing hormones see a drop in performance — more in events centered on endurance and less in those centered on power and strength — but the drop doesn’t eliminate their male advantage.""In her words, ""I encourage you to consider revisions to HR 5 that provide for protections for LGBTQ people that don’t risk these invaluable goods, and that are otherwise considered about the circumstances in which sex still matters."" While that might sound more polite than how Donald Trump speaks about trans people and sports, it’s the same message. Polite-sounding calls for laws against minority groups are often even more dangerous. Since 2019, Coleman's work has been cited in both proposed and enacted anti-transgender bills in at least 13 states, in addition to a policy response letter calling for advocating for similar restrictions signed by attorney generals from 18 states. According to The Washington Post, states that have passed restrictive anti-LGBTQ+ laws, including anti-trans sports bans, have seen a wave of hate crimes against trans children in schools. Her work contributes to a nationwide wave of legislation not only banning transgender athletes but also restricting trans medical care and imposing bathroom bills. Prior to Coleman’s involvement, the number of anti-gay and anti-trans laws being introduced in state and national legislatures was declining. However, since 2019, the introduction and passage of these laws have skyrocketed. While there are many factors that contributed to the significant increase in anti-trans laws starting in 2019, Coleman’s testimony marks a distinct turning point. Before she testified to the US House in favor of legal trans sports bans in April 2019, there were no anti-trans sports laws, and since her testimony there have been many, and they often cite her by name.In the past, Coleman has claimed not to support three of the bills that cite her work by name because they didn’t include exceptions for trans girls who “have never experienced male puberty.” However, in her recent piece for The Washington Post, she now claims that “even a trans girl who doesn’t experience male puberty holds athletic advantages from experiencing male sexual development in childhood,” suggesting a change from her original position. Even if Coleman’s objections against the anti-trans laws that cite her work were not dishonest years ago, she has now rejected her own former theoretically semi-inclusive statements. Ultimately, she is advocating for the kind of discrimination that leads to anti-trans laws and violence, against both trans people and people accused of being trans.Coleman has not condemned the more recent anti-trans bills citing her by name, such as Virginia’s 2024 SB 723 — even after being reached out by the local activist group of which I am a member. And as seen by her opinion pieces in Quillette and The Washington Post, she hasn’t stopped advocating for these sports bans and other forms of discrimination. Certainly, the legislators citing Coleman in these trans ban laws have no doubt about the meaning of her work.Finally, a peer-reviewed scientific paper she cites in The Washington Post to provide proof of trans women on hormone replacement therapy’s ongoing “biological advantage” includes the following disclaimer showing the scientific rigor of its claims after its discussion of trans women’s bodies: “Key questions and opportunities remain for high-quality, well-controlled, and impactful longitudinal studies on the trajectory of performance changes in transgender athletes and the physiological and anatomical mechanisms involved.” Given that even the scientists Coleman herself chose to cite are not totally confident in these findings, how can that be enough to support laws that have been shown to lead to violence against a tiny population of vulnerable children?Despite Duke University's professed commitment to inclusivity, it continues to support and award Coleman. This support has global repercussions for transgender individuals and women who do not conform to traditional feminine norms. It is easy to sell a rainbow flag and host drag queen fashion shows, but what does it mean when that same institution promotes laws and policies that harm transgender people and those accused of being transgender? What does it mean when that institution’s faculty feel free to publicly attack trans people? What does it mean when that institution promotes policies that lead to violence against children in schools?Vivian Taylor graduated from Duke’s public policy and divinity programs in 2020. She is part of the leadership team for Stand Up for Trans Women, a group of Durham locals and Duke alumni who are calling on Duke University to stop promoting anti-gay and anti-transgender laws.

Unmasking indoctrination: The Zionist agenda behind Duke's “Antisemitism 101 Training”,Eli Meyerhoff,2024-06-26T12:00:00Z,Jun,26,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/062624-meyerhoff-unmasking-indoctrination-20240626.html,"When I signed up for Jewish Life at Duke’s ""Antisemitism 101 Training,"" I hoped for an impartial, educational approach to understanding and combating antisemitism on campus. However, from attending the training along with two fellow Duke staff members, I found that it instead indoctrinates participants into the political project of Zionism.JLD frames itself as a welcoming community for all Jews at Duke. According to JLD’s website, it is ""the hub for all things Jewish on Duke’s campus,"" and it ""takes a pluralistic approach to Judaism to ensure that all Jewish students, regardless of affiliation, are welcome and included."" They also proclaim that JLD is ""fully accredited by Hillel International."" Yet, this affiliation contradicts their claim of being welcoming to all Jewish students. Hillel’s ""Israel Guidelines"" prevent any affiliate to “partner with, house, or host organizations, groups, or speakers that as a matter of policy or practice” seek to “delegitimize” Israel. This means that JLD cannot be welcoming to anti-Zionist Jews, such as members of Jewish Voice for Peace, an organization that opposes the ethno-nationalist state of Israel and proposes alternative means for Jewish safety, particularly through solidarity with other marginalized peoples. The leaders of JLD’s training were not transparent and up-front about this limit. They presented JLD as a home for all Jews at Duke, but they did not reveal that the training came from Hillel’s mandated Zionist perspective. However, their perspective is just one political perspective among the range of Jewish political perspectives on how to define and combat antisemitism. By obscuring the political agenda behind their training’s materials, the JLD staff made it seem like they were giving objective, unbiased definitions of antisemitism, Zionism, and anti-Zionism. For example, the training relied heavily on resources from Hillel International and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which the JLD staff presented as objective expertise, but are known for their Zionist positions (as seen in statements by Hillel’s president, this profile of Hillel, and articles on ""the ADL’s anti-Palestinian advocacy,"" the ADL’s campaign to suppress criticism of Israel by calling it 'anti-semitism' and the ADL’s role in a network of ""astroturf antisemitism watchdogs""). The participants at this training might have taken what the JLD presented as fact and as the only perspective out there if my colleagues and I had not attended and spoken out to share alternative perspectives. Historical narratives are inevitably contested and shaped by political commitments. However, this differs from ""historical"" accounts that lie, repress inconvenient facts, and are disingenuously framed to serve an ideological agenda. The bulk of the JLD’s training content came in a 3-part video series created by Hillel International. The history sections of the training’s videos were selectively framed in ways that portrayed the Zionist creation of the Israeli nation-state as the necessary endpoint of Jewish history. To justify Zionism, they repeated the myth of a ""unified kingdom of Israel"" that supposedly split into two kingdoms, Israel and Judah. In ""The Invention of the Land of Israel,"" the Israeli historian Shlomo Sand debunks this ""mythistory"": ""Because a united kingdom encompassing both ancient Judea and Israel never existed, a unifying Hebrew name for such a territory never emerged. As a result, all biblical texts employed the same pharaonic name for the region: the land of Canaan."" To make Zionism seem like the necessary political project for Jewish peoples, the video’s presentation of Jewish history obscured alternative political responses to the longstanding problem that Jewish people have faced: how to create safety as a marginalized, oppressed minority in a world of nation-states. The Zionist solution to this problem is to try to find Jewish safety by creating a Jewish doppelgänger of those nation-states and their colonial projects: the ethno-nationalist state of Israel, a settler-colonial project that has violently dispossessed the Palestinian people from their land, leading to the genocide in Gaza today. The JLD’s Hillel-produced training video made no mention of the colonial character of the Zionist project, about which the early Zionists themselves had been explicit. It neglected to mention that during the 19th century, only around 2 to 5% of the population was Jewish, prior to the increasing influx of Jewish settlers in the 20th century, including political Zionists as well as refugees who were brought along in the Zionist settlement project. It blamed Israel's dispossession of Palestinian people from their land in 1948 on ""the Israel-Arab war."" It didn’t give any perspectives on this history from Palestinian people, who call their dispossession ""the Nakba,"" which means ""catastrophe.""The training failed to acknowledge the rich history of anti-Zionist, diasporic Jewish movements that have presented alternative visions for Jewish safety. For example, the Jewish Labor Bund, which emerged in the same year as the birth of political Zionism, 1897, creates Jewish safety through building solidarity with other marginalized peoples. Bundism is centered on the principle of doikayt in Yiddish (""hereness"" in English), which is about seeing wherever Jews live in the world as their country. Opposed to the Zionist path of escaping to a Jewish state, Bundists affirm the places they landed in the diaspora as where they should struggle in solidarity with other oppressed people, to improve the world for all. The principle of creating Jewish safety through solidarity is also enacted by the current movements of If Not Now and Jewish Voice for Peace, including the JVP-Triangle chapter, which is ""grounded in Jewish community and in the south, working for a free Palestine and liberation for all.""The JLD training also sought to delegitimize the current forms of these anti-Zionist Jewish movements by associating contemporary anti-Zionism with antisemitism. For example, the JLD’s packet of resources had a list of ""Antisemitic Myths"" from the ADL, which included this statement: ""Criticism of Israel is not in and of itself antisemitic. But much of contemporary anti-Zionism, or the delegitimization of Israel and its supporters, draws on and perpetuates antisemitic tropes."" In order to tar anti-Zionists with this charge of antisemitism, the JLD trainers mischaracterized anti-Zionist arguments. For example, trainers argued that calling for the end of the Israeli state is antisemitic because doing so would deny Jewish people the right to self-determination. This conflation is wrong because anti-Zionists' calls for eradicating the settler-colonial, Jewish-supremacist state of Israel coexist with their affirmations of alternative forms of Jewish self-determination. As Professor Joseph Massad notes, ""the invocation of 'Jewish self-determination' in the land of the Palestinians has been the major camouflage used to embellish the reigning regime of Jewish supremacy in Israel."" By contrast, anti-Zionists affirm that Jewish people have the right of self-determination, but they also argue that this right should not come at the expense of oppressing other people by dispossessing them of their land and committing systemic violence against them, as the Zionist settler-colonial project has done for over a century. Anti-Zionist and non-Zionist Jewish people have promoted many alternative, non-colonial forms of self-determining Jewish national autonomy, such as the Bund's cultural, diasporic nationalism, creating safety through building solidarity with the other marginalized peoples with whom they share the places in which they live throughout the world. Finally, JLD discussed what they claimed to be anti-Zionist instances of antisemitism, while they gave no mention of the antisemitism committed by Zionists themselves. Since the founding of political Zionism, its proponents have deployed antisemitic accounts of diasporic Jews in contrast with their preferred ideal of the Israeli Jew. For example, consider the Zionist leader, Ze’ev Jabotinsky’s statement: ""because the Yid [the negative caricature of European Jewry] is ugly, sickly, and lacks decorum, we shall endow the ideal image of the Hebrew with masculine beauty."" This Zionist antisemitism against diasporic Jews continues today, as seen in the responses of Zionists to the Twitter posts of diasporic Jews who call out Israel’s oppression of the Palestinian people. (See Eli Valley’s satirical comic about this Zionist antisemitism, ""Israel Man and Diaspora Boy."") The trainers also neglected to mention that antisemitism has been ubiquitous historically and currently among Christian Zionists, who outnumber Jewish Zionists in the US.Duke’s campus is supposed to be a place for education — for developing knowledge through practices of critical thinking and discussion, grappling with evidence and reasons to evaluate a wide range of political positions on any given issue. By contrast, indoctrination influences people to adopt a certain political project, and relies on suppressing critical thinking by selectively presenting a limited range of evidence and perspectives. This is what I experienced at JLD’s ""Antisemitism 101 Training"": Zionist political indoctrination masquerading as education. Unlike JLD’s Zionist approach to understanding and combating antisemitism, effective approaches to addressing antisemitism, such as that of the American Friends Service Committee, center its intersections with other forms of oppression, such as white supremacy, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and settler colonialism. Intersectional approaches to collective liberation — working together to build safety through solidarity across different struggles — aim to eliminate antisemitism and all forms of oppression. Toward this end, I am excited to organize with Jewish Voice for Peace, Duke Academics and Staff for Justice in Palestine, Duke Divest Coalition, Makom, Carolina Bund, and other groups who are constructing solidarities across lines of difference. For Jewish people who consider ourselves to be non-Zionist or anti-Zionist — who don’t want to fall in line with Zionism’s oppressive, settler-colonial version of Jewishness — these groups are creating communities that offer alternative means of belonging, safety, and participation in Jewish traditions.Given the clear unwillingness of the university and existing Jewish institutions at Duke to acknowledge and support the real diversity among Jewish students, staff, and faculty — including the many non- and anti-Zionist Jews on campus — it is time to build alternative social and intellectual spaces.

Holding Duke accountable: A call for divestment from Israeli apartheid 76 years into the ongoing Nakba,Duke Divest Coalition,2024-05-28T12:00:00Z,May,28,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/052824-duke-divest-coalition-holding-duke-accountable-20240528.html,"May 15, 2024, marked the 76th anniversary of the 1948 Nakba and the Palestinian people's ongoing catastrophe amid occupation, apartheid and genocide. Between 1947 and 1949, 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly expelled from their homes and lands in a displacement known as the Nakba, or ""catastrophe"" in Arabic. Every year on May 15, Palestinians commemorate Nakba Day around the world in remembrance of the ethnic cleansing of Palestine and the near-total destruction of Palestinian society.Many Palestinians are likening Israel's current siege on Gaza to a ""second Nakba,"" drawing from their collective memory of historical displacement and the destruction of their homes, land and cultural heritage. This comparison is rooted in both the immediate suffering endured by Palestinians in Gaza and the transgenerational trauma stemming from the 1948 Nakba and the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestine. Over the past seven months, the world has witnessed Israel and the United States unleash unimaginable destruction on Palestine. Since the Hamas-led attack in Israel, which resulted in the deaths of roughly 1,200 people and the taking of 250 hostages, Israel has killed approximately 35,000 Palestinians, including nearly 7,800 identified children and thousands more unidentified and missing under the rubble. 1.1 million people, more than half of Gaza's population, are experiencing catastrophic food insecurity, and 32 people, including 28 children, have died of starvation. Israel launched a full-scale military invasion on May 7, 2024, after corralling 1.4 million people into a 25-square-mile “safe zone” in Rafah. On Sunday, May 26, Israeli airstrikes targeted a “safe zone” in Rafah filled with more than 85% of the Gazan population, killing 45 people, dismembering children and setting fire to the tents and makeshift shelters. Israel’s latest attack has exacerbated the already dire situation at local hospitals, which are unable to adequately treat Palestinian civilians’ traumatic injuries and burns. The destruction of Palestinian homes, land and heritage is not restricted to Gaza. There has been a thoroughly documented and substantial spike in state-backed Israeli settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in recent years, building on over 50 years of unrestricted settler violence. Israeli settlers — individuals who reside on Palestinian land illegally — physically attack Palestinians and destroy or severely damage Palestinian property daily. Armed settlers, alongside Israeli military units, have raided Palestinian communities, assaulted and forcibly displaced residents. Recent settler attacks have entirely uprooted at least seven Palestinian communities and displaced residents from 20 other Palestinian communities. Israeli settlers have also attacked, looted and destroyed aid trucks bound for Gaza. 800 Israeli settler-led attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank have been documented since October 7, 2023. Israeli forces have also killed at least 500 Palestinians in the West Bank during this period. Since 2021, Israeli settler attacks have become increasingly coordinated, with larger groups of settlers carrying out attacks that strategically target Palestinians and their livelihoods, including cutting down trees, razing farmlands and intentionally burning cars and homes. The Israeli military frequently protects these settlers and even provides them with weapons. The recent increase in Israeli settler attacks and Israeli military violence in the West Bank is not a response to October 7. Rather, it builds on a well-documented rise in state-backed Israeli settler violence against Palestinian civilians for years. According to a recent article in The Chronicle, DUMAC, Inc., the company that manages Duke’s investment and endowment has disclosed investments with and holdings in companies operating in Israel or linked to Israeli activities. The report shows that Duke maintains significant partnerships and receives substantial funding from the U.S. Department of Defense, some of which involve collaborations with private military contractors that supply military aid to Israel, primarily for research and development purposes. Duke University is financially and institutionally complicit in Israel's ongoing genocide, apartheid and occupation of Palestine. Since October, Duke has failed to condemn or speak on the horrifying violence Israel is committing and which we are all witnessing. Despite calls from Duke community members to disclose and divest from companies profiting from Israel's violence in Palestine, the Duke administration has not indicated that it plans to assess university investments and has not issued any statements calling for an immediate, permanent ceasefire in Gaza or denouncing Israel's ongoing genocidal campaign against the Palestinian people. President Vincent Price has released only two statements regarding these events. The first statement, released on October 10, 2023, failed to mention Gaza, Palestine and Palestinians at all, despite nearly 1,000 deaths and 5,000 injuries documented in Gaza by the time of the statement’s release. His second statement, released on October 16, 2023, added a brief reference to all Palestinian and Israeli lives lost. While Price and the Duke administration claim political neutrality, they have made strong statements of condemnation in the past, including against Russia's invasion of Ukraine and firmly stated support for the Ukrainian people. It seems that Israel's killing of more than 35,000 and wounding of 79,200 Palestinians is not enough to evoke ""sadness"" and ""outrage"" from Price, given that he has chosen to remain silent since those two initial statements. Instead, administrators have censured students and faculty under the guise of institutional neutrality for the entirety of this past academic year. Despite being an expert on public opinion, social influence and political communication, Price has shown a striking lack of responsiveness to recent anti-Arab sentiment, Islamophobia and other forms of discrimination on campus. His background and acclaimed research supposedly position him well to consider and incorporate feedback from the Duke community. Yet, Price's silence on the urgent calls for Duke to divest from companies complicit in Israel's violence against Palestinians stands in stark contrast to his professional expertise. His failure to issue a robust statement or take decisive action undermines his so-called strategic vision of ""empowering people"" and ""building community."" Price’s reluctance to address the moral and ethical concerns of students, faculty and alumni reflects a troubling inconsistency that calls into question the university's commitment to its stated values of racial justice and global engagement. Duke's Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) and Student Affairs administrators have, on multiple occasions, failed to adequately investigate or speak on incidents of anti-Palestinian racism and national origin-based discrimination on our campus, including the repeated defacement of Muslim and Palestine-related murals on the Free Expression Bridge. It made no efforts to acknowledge or investigate until students initiated a collective reporting campaign, which was posted to social media on April 27, 2024. The OIE emailed all Duke graduate, professional and undergraduate students about the defacement the following day. The defacements included altering a Quranic verse on the mural, “Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful,” being edited to include the word “not” before “Merciful,” and placing posters of red cows over the flags of several Muslim-majority nations — images that are a reference to calls to destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the Muslim holy site in Jerusalem. The OIE’s negligence has led the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, to call on state and federal law enforcement authorities to investigate the repeated defacement of the mural as a possible hate crime. Duke itself is a product of land theft and erasure. It contributes to the gentrification of Durham and the displacement of many Black and Brown residents who reside predominantly in lower-income areas, starting with opportunistic land grabs in the 1960s and 70s. In 1977, the Duke administration participated in the demolition of Crest Street by advocating for the extension of the Durham Freeway, which fractured a predominantly Black and low-income community near campus with ties to Duke's labor force. In 1988, a Duke-owned property was rezoned from residential to office use, displacing 42 families. In the last decade, Duke has repeatedly undermined public transit projects, cutting funding for the Bull City Connector in 2017 and almost single-handedly killing the Durham-Orange Light Rail Transit project that would connect Durham and Orange counties while ignoring calls from low-income Black and Brown communities to invest in the existing bus transit system. Duke's use of land grabs, gentrification and forced displacement to expand its operations and wealth are the same tactics used by the Israeli government against Palestinians in occupied Palestine. Tactics of state-sanctioned violence against and surveillance of minoritized communities in the United States are inextricably tied to Israel's apartheid against Palestinians. Public surveillance and law enforcement militarization in the U.S. are enabled by the same technologies and public-private partnerships that facilitate the Israeli occupation. American technology companies like Google and Amazon — driven by profit over people — have contracts with the Israeli government and military; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; U.S. Customs and Border Protection; and the U.S. military to provide computing infrastructure, artificial intelligence and other technology services. Exchange programs between the U.S. and Israel bring together law enforcement and military personnel to share tactics for violence and control. In 2018, a coalition of Black, Palestinian and Jewish organizations in Durham led a campaign that made this city the first in the U.S. to pass a resolution prohibiting police exchanges with Israel. We are informed by and build upon the work of those who came before us and those who work alongside us. Since the beginning of Israel's violent onslaught, Duke students, alumni, faculty and staff have worked together and used our collective power to organize many actions: walkouts, die-ins, vigils, rallies, teach-ins, film screenings, marches and fundraisers with the explicit call to end the ongoing genocide in Gaza and fight for Palestinian liberation. We acknowledge the profound urgency of the moment, and we are deeply committed to holding Duke accountable for its financial and institutional complicity in Israel's ongoing genocide, apartheid and occupation of Palestine. A group of graduate and undergraduate students have worked with alumni to formally outline a student-led coalition's demands, values and mission. The Duke Divest Coalition (DDC) is a student-led coalition of undergraduate, graduate, staff, faculty and alumni groups. Our coalition draws inspiration from a rich legacy of student and worker organizing, echoing the voices of those who protested U.S. imperialism in Vietnam and Iraq, fought for Black liberation by occupying the Allen Building in 1969, rallied against Duke's investments in apartheid South Africa in the 1980s, advocated for campus workers' rights through the occupation of the Allen Building in 2016 and worked for transformative institutional change by disrupting President Price's Alumni Address and establishing the People's State of the University in 2018. We recognize that the Palestinian liberation movement is intimately connected to a network of liberation movements worldwide. The Duke Divest Coalition (DDC) is committed to supporting Palestinian rights and advocating for Duke's divestment from Israeli occupation, apartheid and genocide. Our complete statement and demands are on our website. "
Abridging freedom of speech at Duke,Luke Vrotsos,2024-05-04T16:30:00Z,May,4,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/050424-vrotsos-abridging-speech-20240504.html,"Editor’s note: This article includes discussion of homophobic messages or slurs.The official rules for Duke’s “free expression” bridge on East Campus have long stated that students “may express opinions within this area that are not restricted by content, except by legal standards."" Students may paint over messages “no matter how recently they have been painted,” allowing anybody to remove any disfavored content. As written, this policy appears simple enough to implement: Given the broad speech protections in American law, little administrative intervention would be required. It also accords with Duke’s Statement on Open Expression, which promises not to “take the expedient and dangerous path of shutting down discourse.”Duke administrators, however, appear to believe these commitments to free speech are more honored in the breach than the observance. Over the years, they have repeatedly removed content from the bridge and worked with police to identify the authors. In 2018, they added surveillance to the mix by installing a camera to help their investigations. Expression, far from being free, is monitored, censored, investigated, and publicly condemned. “Free expression,” if it is to mean anything, must protect not only content that we agree with or mildly dislike but also that which we find vile and upsetting. As a gay student, I would prefer a campus without comments like “kill f[*]gs” (as one bridge troll wrote in 1994), “get AIDS in hell” (2010), or “fuck gays” (2016). Still, no coherent limiting principle exists that rules out these words but could not be used to justify banning speech that I support. Even apparently reasonable restrictions, like an old bridge policy that forbade “vulgar or obscene graffiti,” can result in such censorship. In 1997, Duke employees removed pride slogans painted by LGBT students, some of which administrators deemed “obscene.” More recently, Republican state officials have used similar language to justify banning books and drag shows. Invoking free expression to fight these misguided measures is effective only if one’s support is consistent.The bridge controversy’s latest iteration has arisen amid the war in Gaza, with the university removing the second half of “Palestine will be free, from the river to the sea” last October. In April, administrators painted over the defacement of a Quranic verse and images connected to the destruction of the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. They also launched an investigation into the “circumstances surrounding this event.” In their announcements of these actions, Duke administrators did not cite any “legal standards” that would restrict either message. They would be hard-pressed to find one: The First Amendment’s protection of free speech has no exceptions for hate speech or blasphemy. As Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, said last year, “the First Amendment exists to protect exactly this kind of political expression. Therefore, phrases like 'from the river to the sea,' ... are protected.” The April email did refer to the Duke Community Standard and the Policy on Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment, and Related Misconduct. The former states twice that there are no restrictions, apart from the law, on content at the bridge. While the latter contains some vague language, it helpfully gives 18 specific examples of prohibited conduct, including four of Islamophobia. Every example concerns behavior targeted at specific individuals, which the bridge messages were not. Duke should either stick to its stated policy, and allow all legal speech on the bridge, or abandon the pretense of a “free expression” bridge altogether. In this scenario, the University would treat any graffiti on the bridge as the vandalism it would be in any other location. While I do not favor this policy, it would at least be honest and let the university maintain neutrality in contentious political matters. After all, Duke is under no obligation to host a “free expression” bridge — and, in practice, it already does not. Luke Vrotsos is a second-year PhD student in statistical science at Duke."
"Duke J Street U statement on ""Gaza Solidarity Encampments""",Executive Board of Duke J Street U,2024-05-02T17:38:00Z,May,2,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/050224-duke-j-street-u-statement-on-encampments-20240502.html,"In this time of heightened tensions on college campuses, it is critical to vigilantly ensure the safety of Jewish students while protecting free speech and protest. We must be careful not to breach into anti-democratic action that conflicts with our liberal ideals and contributes to more hate.J Street does not align itself with many positions held by protestors at the “Gaza Solidarity Encampments.” However, at the core of J Street’s mission is a belief in free speech and protest. Allowing police and the National Guard to arrest students at Emory University, University of Texas at Austin, Columbia University, University of Southern California, etc. is disturbing and ineffective at combating antisemitism. As we saw, Columbia University’s “Gaza Solidarity Encampment” in New York City drew hundreds of protestors after a police crackdown. These acts of repression only galvanize extremists within and outside these universities who promote violence against students.At the same time, we are incredibly disturbed by news reports of blatantly violent antisemitic rhetoric, chants and signs that put Jewish students in danger and lead to the delegitimization of a fundamentally legitimate movement supporting Palestinian liberation. J Street stands against antisemitic, racist or dehumanizing rhetoric on campus or anywhere.We at Duke J Street U reaffirm our support for a bilateral ceasefire to free the hostages and end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and a two-state solution that will allow both peoples to live safely with self-determination. We are hopeful about recent negotiations for a temporary cease-fire deal but know that they are not enough and not guaranteed. We recognize that free speech is essential as the American government continues to permit Israel to act without significant scrutiny.Duke J Street U is a chapter of the student organizing arm of J Street U.

Meeting the moment,Anisha Reddy,2024-04-24T07:00:00Z,Apr,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042424-reddy-meeting-the-moment-20240424.html,"My life at Duke, in many ways, didn’t start until I walked into The Chronicle’s office. My first time in 301 Flowers was also my first time in a campus building that wasn’t a dorm, classroom or dining hall amid a national lockdown, my first Cookout strawberry milkshake, my first glimpse into 119 years of Duke’s history documented in yellowing print headlines pinned to the walls.At the time, I had no idea how deeply The Chronicle would shape my next four years, how intimately our work would underscore what it means to love a place as contradictory as Duke in a time as fraught as now.I learned to report campus news in a year that, in hindsight, none of us were prepared for. Some of my first stories were about Duke’s ever-changing COVID policies and their dystopian effects on our lives. Others were our necessary reckoning with institutional racism during my first real election year.I fell in love with student journalism along the way for teaching me how to find a sense of place when everything is in flux and how to document a historical juncture as we live through it.As lockdown eased, I was new to Duke all over again, learning to navigate a social scene that was trying its hardest to return to normal. I started spending hours in 301 Flowers every week, getting to know the people behind the bylines over rolling chairs, piles of empty starburst wrappers and ambient noise filtering in from the sports hall.I learned how to report on community, on the convergences and gatherings that are the lifeblood of campus. Along the way, I realized that community includes our neighbors in Durham, and took on the task of explaining to readers how national discourse and local reform impact our daily lives.I grew to love The Chronicle even more for teaching me how to be there as a friend in the newsroom, a listening ear on campus and a reliable member of a larger ecosystem.At the start of my tenure as a senior editor, I was comfortable, for once, with Duke and my role within it. I finally felt secure enough to lose myself in the details of the work. With each piece of advice I gave a nervous new writer, each story we butchered and rebuilt through edits, each time I clicked “Schedule Tweet” on a controversial headline, I settled into my role.Through it all, our newsroom committed to holding our university accountable through detailed and thoughtfulreporting. By this time, my relationship with my work embodied the love of an old married couple, time-tested and world-weary, but committed nonetheless.In my final year with The Chronicle, this love has been put to the test. When I started my current role as a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion co-coordinator, I was excited to focus my energy on improving our newsroom from within. I hoped that we’d build on previous conversations we had about becoming a community-centered paper, committed to uplifting marginalized voices through our journalism.I knew it would be an uphill battle. We faced apathy and distrust from community members, a diversifying but not yet representative newsroom, and most pressingly, a vision that was too transformative to be accomplished over one year.We also had to contend with a shifting political climate — which has historically shaped the work of student newspapers, but rarely to this extent. The action-reaction, demand-backlash cycles of America’s culture wars have rarely moved this quickly and rarely centered so acutely on the university campus.In four short years, I witnessed Duke’s admissions team change their tune from saying “Black Lives Matter” to ending a full-ride merit scholarship for Black students. I witnessed Duke finally respond to longstanding student demands by hiring more diverse faculty, only to ignore the statements of Palestinian solidarity made by many of the same faculty members.Initially, I believed that nobody was better equipped to reckon with this shift than The Chronicle. After all, journalism has the power to go beyond narrowly framed narratives that vilify dissent and hamper transformative dialogue. We have the responsibility to write unflinchingly about the confrontations we see at Duke, and the ability to contextualize these confrontations with efforts like interfaith reconciliation on campus and grassroots organizing in Durham.However, I find myself unable to say with confidence that The Chronicle handled the powder keg of this year’s news cycle with the nuance and care that we should have. For this, I must take responsibility. At the end of my tenure, I do not have any conviction that our reporting strengthened our relationships with marginalized communities on campus.It was not just our paper that I saw fall short this year. Our legacy media organizations have been unwilling or unable to meet basic journalistic standards in their coverage of the war in Gaza. Journalists repeatedly shielded Israel from facing accountability by relying on passive voice and “both sides” rhetoric, by spreading unverified information in their refusal to challenge state narratives.Amid the deadliest war on record for journalists, I started to fall out of love with the work that has given me purpose. As I felt this happening, I climbed three flights to our office. When I got there, I went to look at the faded pages of the print volumes that welcomed me to Duke a small lifetime ago. On our walls, within those pages, I found stories of people speaking truthtopower.I remembered, then, that to love an institution is not only to be immersed in it but also to take responsibility for it, to hold it accountable for its flaws and demand better of it. Over four years, our newsroom taught me how to love the complicated institution that is Duke. Now, I’m tasked with using these lessons to love the complicated institution that is The Chronicle.I take responsibility for every perspective we could have but did not share. I hold us accountable for damaging the trust of the communities that we cover. And I demand that we do better at uplifting each other’s voices, especially those that challenge our power structures.I address this farewell to a version of The Chronicle that has never yet existed, to a vision of community, to student journalism at its bravest and to the organization I hope we can become.Anisha Reddy is a senior and served as a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion coordinator for The Chronicle’s 119th volume. She has no idea where to even start in thanking Milla Surjadi for being the most disarmingly thoughtful co-coordinator, editor, journalist and friend she could ask for. She would also like to thank Kathryn Thomas and Katie Tan for their easy conversation and steadfast reliability over the years, transforming editing shifts into cherished memories. She would be remiss not to thank Pilar Kelly for all of the late-night couch conversations that turned into story ideas and life lessons.She would like to thank Ayra Charania for all of the energy she spent making our newsroom a more welcoming place for new writers and Preetha Ramachandran for laying crucial groundwork toward a more critical understanding of student journalism. She would especially like to thank everyone she has met in person, over Zoom or through email to be interviewed for stories over the years. If this includes you, please know that Anisha and The Chronicle would be nowhere without your willingness to share your experiences."
Listening and learning,Amy Guan,2024-04-24T07:00:00Z,Apr,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042424-guan-listening-learning-20240424.html,"The Chronicle has been a safe haven for me to explore my interests in student journalism and a window for me to learn more about the work of students and people who are a part of the Duke and Durham community. When I first came to Duke, I was overwhelmed by the new environment, homesickness, classwork, daily symptom monitoring surveys and COVID-19 tests. After being in my room for a full day of Zoom classes and going to Marketplace to get to-go meals, I lacked the traditional social experiences of college life. Luckily, I made close friendships with others in my first-year dorm, Brown, and formed a strong relationship with my first-year RA. Joining The Chronicle almost immediately after classes started was one of the best decisions I could have made. It allowed me to connect with people and learn about Duke in deeper and more unique ways. I did not have previous journalism experience in high school but loved writing and wanted to venture outside of my comfort zone. I vividly remember working with another new writer on our first story focused on student experiences with pool testing experiences. We sat in the Brown common room and brainstormed plans to reach out to students and approaches to structure the story. I enjoyed reaching out to students and reporting about their experiences. Through Sunday afternoon news meetings on Zoom, the support and enthusiasm of lower and upper masthead members made me feel that I had a place in The Chronicle. Soon, I picked up more stories and applied to be a staff writer. After being invited to The Chronicle office following my acceptance as a staff writer, I remember climbing up the stairs and opening the office door to hear laughter and see a group of editors sitting in a circle. This tight-knit community of editors welcomed new staff writers with our favorite snacks and guided us on a tour of the office space. Witnessing the behind-the-scenes work that masthead does for The Chronicle inspired my first-year self to continue.Looking back over the years, I certainly had difficult times when I struggled through my engineering and pre-med chemistry coursework. But I became happier when I could work on a story for The Chronicle or go into the office for my editing shifts. Through The Chronicle, I loved exploring my interests in writing and journalism outside of academic work. Getting to write stories about student life during the pandemic, Duke Athletics Band, the Center for Muslim Life educational workshop, Young Trustee candidates, Durham mayoral candidates, RAs during COVID and health and science research have been highlights of my time with The Chronicle. Each story was an opportunity for me to both learn something about Duke and the vibrant communities within it and share what I learned with a broader community. From speaking with band members to attending a CML educational workshop, I listened to each interviewee share their eye-opening and rich perspectives. The practice of listening and learning from others’ stories soon extended to my life outside of The Chronicle. Seeing my first-year RA’s dedication to hosting events for everyone to connect while following strict social-distancing rules inspired me to apply to be an RA. I lived in Brown for my first year at Duke, and then I served as an RA in Brown for my sophomore and junior years. Being an RA challenged me in various ways and taught me critical teamwork and organization skills. I loved meeting and supporting first-year students and taking time each week to connect and reflect with my RA team. Brown will always hold a very special place in my heart. As my graduation date nears and I reflect on my four years at Duke, I’ve realized that I will miss the simple moments such as cooking weekend breakfasts and making dumplings with friends in the dorm community kitchens, attending cycling and other fitness classes with friends, and taking long, peaceful walks around the East Campus loop. After four years, my involvement with The Chronicle has certainly shaped who I am, helping me to improve my writing, learn about Duke and gain sweet memories and friendships that I will forever cherish. Many of the doors that have opened for me in my Duke experience are ones that I could not have expected when I first arrived. As I look back, I am grateful that I was able to take a step forward and try new things. I look forward to the future as it holds many unopened doors waiting to be explored. Amy Guan is a Pratt senior and served as senior editor of The Chronicle’s 119th volume. She would like to thank Audrey Wang (editor-in-chief for Vol. 119) and Milla Surjadi (editor-in-chief for Vol. 118) as well as all masthead members for their excellent leadership. She is grateful for the entire Chronicle community that makes 301 Flowers a welcoming and enjoyable space. She is grateful to her mentor Leah Boyd (editor-in-chief for Vol. 117) for providing unwavering support in The Chronicle and advice for BME. Finally, she would like to thank her professors, friends and family for their support over the past four years."
The Chronicle is my best-kept secret from my parents,Linda Cao,2024-04-24T07:00:00Z,Apr,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042424-cao-chronicle-best-kept-secret-20240424.html,"What’s the worst lie, whether it’s blatant deception or simply omission of information, you’ve told your parents? Don’t worry: You’re allowed to plead the fifth. As for me, I may have disclosed my 3 a.m. disapproving escapades to my mother, but I have lied about all participation in The Chronicle.My journey with The Chronicle began in freshman year as an Opinion columnist. I would publish your typical articles — everything from shaming students for having a shorter attention span than a goldfish to applauding Chinese protests for COVID-19 governmentally enforced regulations. You know, the usual. Jump forward almost three years, and now I, unbelievably, am an Opinion managing editor.Despite the wide spectrum of topics, I strived to have my articles address events that capture the complexity of humanity: ideas most people would acknowledge for a second but scroll past the next, rushing to class to catch the C1 or take a photo with Gwyneth Paltrow. At Duke, students are bombarded with obligations and demands, living in a bubble, and, like other students, I found myself never having enough time: to laugh, to cry, to think, to say good-bye.My deception about The Chronicle stems from how growing up, I was discouraged from having an opinion about controversial, sensitive topics such as abortion, LGBTQIA+ and sexual assault. I was never encouraged to change the world; I was encouraged to let the world change me. Always observe and adapt but never question or comment. For I was too naïve and too inexperienced to truly understand people, society and the world. Thus, despite the years of efforts for this community, I have never told my parents about The Chronicle, as journalism would oppose my roots.I don’t necessarily disagree with my roots because to care requires effort, and effort is coupled with burden. Most individuals struggle to balance the emotional intensity of current events with comparably demanding priorities. Yet, through The Chronicle, I recognized that we’re at the age where we are supposed to be developing opinions, formulating ideas, navigating the world to find where our position possibly stands. We are immensely fortunate to be at a campus that fosters such thought and diversity, so why wouldn’t you take advantage of it? You’re allowed to be wrong — emphasis on the “we are supposed to be developing.” Indeed, there are a couple of articles I wouldn’t mind rescinding because my opinions have changed over the years. Nevertheless, I’ll leave them there — a snapshot of who I was at the time and how I perceived the world.To acknowledge and comment on the world around us is crucial to existing; it’s a fundamental qualification to be a member of society: to exist. Thus, I encourage you to take hold of existing in the world and to not put a hold on existing. Perhaps, I will also take my parents off hold and finally share the special moments created with The Chronicle. As a faithful member of The Chronicle for almost four years, I bid you farewell and remind you to — even in times of confusion, controversy and uncertainty — always have an opinion.Linda Cao is a Trinity Senior and was an opinion managing editor for The Chronicle’s 119th volume. She would like to thank Audrey, Viktoria, Chrissy and this year’s opinion managing editors and columnists for their support and persistence."
Climbing the beanstalk and the sleeping giant I wish I’d slain,Andrew Long,2024-04-24T07:00:00Z,Apr,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042424-long-climbing-beanstalk-20240424.html,"There are few stranger feelings than being underwhelmed by a lifelong dream.The first time I visited Duke was in February 2019. With two alumni parents back for the first time in 20 years, that meant walking around campus without a guide, grabbing dinner with fabled friends from their past lives and watching Zion Williamson cook N.C. State inside Cameron Indoor Stadium later that night. For being a place I’d never seen, Duke felt so familiar. But when I arrived as a student myself in August 2021, I felt lost.I was homesick beyond measure, too shy to go out and introduce myself and struggling to make friends. On weekdays, I sunk into my schoolwork then spent weekends alone in my room, binging TV shows until my iPad battery died. My mom tried her best to pull me out of my slump with nightly phone calls and videos of my dog, but she tells me now that this period was the most helpless she ever felt as a parent.The one thing that made me feel needed was overloading on blog assignments and game coverage for The Chronicle — the only extracurricular I was compelled to stick with.Steadily, though, hours in the office became less like medicine and more like a morning coffee. Responsibilities I used as a distraction became a welcome part of my routine, and as I spent more time with them, the people I once saw as bosses turned into mentors and then into friends. The example they set made me decide to become an editor — a role I found fulfilling because I could help freshmen struggling to find connections and a purpose just like I had.Getting elected as Vol. 119 sports editor was in many ways the climax of both my journey to find a safe space and the collegiate mandate to pursue professional advancement — validation that I had found my calling and my people. And yet, rarely have I felt more self-critical than I did during my time as editor.I was climbing the proverbial beanstalk, sure, but was entirely unprepared for the sleeping giant waiting to knock me down once I reached the top.For all the successes of my tenure, for all the once-in-a-lifetime chances I was given in the past year, for all the wonderful people I got to know better and the new ones I met, I couldn’t shake the notion that I was doing it all wrong. It was a similar anxiety to my freshman year, but for completely opposite reasons. Instead of worrying about who I would spend time with or if there was a space on campus for me, I was pulled in a million directions by a million different people.My life, friendships and schedule were so deeply intertwined with my job that I began defining my self-worth by how well I did that job. Trying to balance who I wanted to be as a person with what I wanted to do as editor was a scale that I never quite leveled. I grappled with why I worked crazy overtime, went to bed at 5 a.m. and skipped class for a sense of fulfillment that only arrived when a story got clicks or a print edition came together without a hitch. I questioned whether any of my Chronicle friendships were real connections or simply circumstantial conveniences. I wondered whether setting aside time for myself was acceptable because I had a job to do and how I would even fill those hours if I decided to take a break.The stress and self-doubt snowballed, and because I had stories to publish, I said no to weekday trivia nights, watch parties and games in Cameron as a fan with friends or my freshman brother. I fell behind in my classes and stopped exercising. I felt like a bad friend and bad student — both of which affected my ability to be the positive editorial presence I needed to be. That also meant I catastrophized, and errors caused by a lack of energy and low self-confidence distorted into scathing indictments of my character, all of which made me feel worse.I can’t say that it was all worth it for the job, because ultimately it wasn’t the job’s fault. What I loathed wasn’t being sports editor but the way being sports editor made me think about myself.Now, I can see my feelings of inadequacy for what they really were: the products of stress and other deep-rooted insecurities. For too much of the past year, I was burdened by them. That makes me sad, and I’m still nowhere close to finishing the reconciliation process for having one of the hardest years of my life also be the one I had the highest expectations for. I sure as hell don’t know how I’ll grow from it or how I’ll feel about it a year from now. What I do know is that this time, I’m not looking for someone to throw me a lifeline. Instead, I’m trying to find one within myself and reshape my perspective so I don’t feel that way again.Going back to basics is a good place to start. First on that list is to remind myself of all the reasons I’m grateful for this paper and the chance to be sports editor — chief among them the opportunity to deliver damn good coverage at a school I love alongside some of my best friends.Second on that list is to give myself grace. Not just for my mistakes, but for my emotions, which I know don’t come out of nowhere.The last thing on that list is to accept that I gave this thing my all, and that even at my absolute worst, I never wanted to quit. That’s gotta be worth something.Andrew Long is a Trinity junior and served as sports editor of The Chronicle’s 119th volume.He would like to thank Rachael Kaplan for sticking with him throughout the years on and off press row; Mackenzie Sheehy, Dom Fenoglio and Sophie Levenson for always stepping up to the plate; Ranjan Jindal for giving the department a future to look forward to; Jonathan Levitan and Jake Piazza for showing him what a good leader is; and Chrissy Murray for enabling and funding his wildest sportswriting fantasies.He would also like to thank Sasha for supporting him over FaceTime every night with kind words and open ears, the monthly reunions that brought him new life and her endless commitment to the bit; his mom, dad, brother Alex and dog Dagger, all of whom kept him steady when he needed it most; the back room of 301 Flowers which will forever be his safe space; and every member of The Chronicle’s past and present for believing in him. You all mean more than you know."
Writing into the void,Derek Deng,2024-04-24T07:00:00Z,Apr,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042424-deng-writing-into-void-20240424.html,"“Derek, your secret is out,” my sister texted me. “Mom and Dad read your Chronicle article. They know you’re gay.”Freshman year, I penned a staff note for The Chronicle in which I mulled over the shortcomings of navigating Tinder as a gay Asian-American man. Anyone and everyone who knew me — and knew of me — was well aware of this facet of my identity: I was unabashedly flamboyant, sported neon baby tees to my discussion sections and rotated through straight girlfriends like $5 Shein halter tops. Everyone, of course, except my parents, who were blissfully oblivious to my raging homosexuality. They woke up one day with an insatiable curiosity to read my work for The Chronicle, so they Googled me, stumbled upon my staff note and came to know a little bit more about me. And just like that, I was outed by The Chronicle.Or did I out myself? While I was writing my staff note, I knew there was a minuscule chance that my parents would read it. But for most of my life, I never took writing that seriously. I strung together words with a fresh-faced innocence, operating on the assumption that I was writing into the void. No one has the time to read this fluff anyway, I thought to myself. So I laid my emotions bare in The Chronicle. I soon learned that I was not writing into the void. It was a difficult reality to accept — that, as obvious as it sounds, my writing was being read, unraveled and picked apart by classmates, parents and strangers on the Internet. From then on, I began to develop an acute consciousness of this reality, weaving together words with deliberate sobriety. I was scared to write. To write meant to be perceived, which meant to be judged, which meant to be criticized. Inevitably, these concerns bled into my personal life. Existing at Duke was a mental exercise. I developed a keen sensitivity to how I appeared to others, constantly questioning the space that I took up in the white, heteronormative confines of Duke. Caught up in these misgivings, I opened up a Common App transfer application. I never got around to those transfer applications; I couldn’t bear to rehash the humbling ordeal of college admissions. Somehow, in some way, I learned to let go of my existential anxieties via TikTok. In the ephemeral expanse of bite-sized videos, I found a peculiar freedom in the algorithmic carousel of dance trends and get-ready-with-me vlogs. People were shooting the shit on TikTok, sending their most unserious efforts into the digital abyss.So I started shooting the shit. I fabricated a love story between me and my roommate. I bought a jersey that said “Bimbo” on it and ended up going viral on Mexican soccer TikTok. Simultaneously, I accumulated a few haters, someone tried to perform brujeria on me and my Duke peers came to know me as the “baby tee twink.” And to the haters, I say: And what about it? My fondness for digital dilly-dallying reconciled my relationship with posting — and writing — into the void. That was when I began to rekindle my fresh-faced enthusiasm for storytelling, be that cultural analysis articles about Addison Rae or how-to articles on TikTok beauty trends. When I reflect on my most iconic moments at Duke, they all tie back to my readiness to shoot the shit. Take, for instance, that time I took an influencer class at Duke and wrote a Cosmopolitan article about it. Or when I entered a contest to win a free trip to the Bahamas, so I made a video about bidets and won a free trip to the Bahamas. Oh, and my face is literally plastered on a double-decker bus in Miami because I decided I wanted to try out modeling.A few weeks ago, I came across screamintothevoid.com. Its premise is simple: type whatever you may desire, press the “scream” button and watch your words dissolve into the void. Once you’re done screaming, a message pops up: “Glad nobody read that!” I’ve visited that website around 27 times in the past week. I have plenty of things to scream about, questions that remain unanswered. But I’ve learned to embrace the absurdity of it all — to let go and scream into the void. The moral of the story, then, is that there is no moral of the story. These few years are the years wherein we can afford to spend a few hours people-watching on BC Plaza instead of prepping for a McKinsey case interview. Because when else can you board a school bus to a field in the middle of nowhere in a skimpy sailor costume just to listen to frat boys attempt to DJ? Duke, as I’ve come to know it, is really damn fun when you surrender to the void and emancipate yourself from other people's expectations.Case in point: I started writing this article with no idea of what I was going to write about. Just a Google Doc, a kiwi guava Celsius and a dream. And I think I’m doing alright.Derek Deng is a Trinity senior who served as Recess editor for the Chronicle’s 119th volume. He would like to thank his co-editors Anna and Jules for putting up with his dilly-dallying. He extends his warmest congratulations to Zev, who will try his best to live up to Derek’s unparalleled legacy as he leads Vol. 120 Recess. He is confident that Recess will thrive and prosper thanks to its immensely talented team of writers and editors. He thanks his many fans for supporting his endeavors and shaping him into the icon that he is today."
Could’ve been worse,Jazper Lu,2024-04-24T07:00:00Z,Apr,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042424-lu-could-have-been-worse-20240424.html,"One of my favorite pastimes is to think about what my life might look like had I made different decisions. Kind of like in “The Butterfly Effect,” but with much lower stakes.What if I didn’t go to Duke and chose another school? What if I spent my spring break back at home? What if I had made different friends during my freshman year?Some of those decision points are obvious, involving things that are central to my life today. But the most interesting thought experiments deal with those small, subconscious decisions that may unexpectedly change your life’s trajectory:What if I had set my morning alarm a little earlier? What if I didn’t go to that party over the weekend? What if I had eaten pasta that day instead of a burger?One of those tiny decisions came my freshman year as I strolled around the club fair. With my hands full of flyers and whatever bribes people were handing out that day, I headed back to my moldy Giles dorm room. But as I looked around at the commotion, I said, “Screw it, why not?”, and I went for another spin of the tables.It was then that I stumbled across The Chronicle’s booth, where I took a flyer without a second thought.I had never really thought about the field of journalism or had any desire to write for a newspaper. It was just one of those things that happened. Had I not circled back that day, maybe I still would have ended up at The Chronicle. Maybe I wouldn’t. But I’m very glad I did.Nothing has shaped my life more than that one random decision to circle back and pick up that flyer. It’s taken me to courthouses and the state legislature, and given me the opportunity to meet world leaders. It’s taken me to cheesy Duke events that I would never have gone to, and given me face time with the students, faculty and staff that power this university. Most importantly, it’s taken me countless times to our beloved 301 Flowers office, where some of my most treasured memories are goofing around with whoever happened to be there with me. From those countless late nights goofing around in the office to the opportunity to meet world leaders, nothing has shaped my life more than that one random decision to circle back and pick up that flyer. It’s fun to think back about what my life would look like today had I just gone back to my dorm room. Who knows — maybe my life would have been better.Or maybe this whole idea of thinking through alternate timelines is futile. Isn’t everything just a giant, predetermined chemical reaction between atoms that follow a set of rules? Do we really have free will?Usually, these columns share some deep introspective reflections or finish with some grand outlook on the future of journalism. But I’ll save that for when I graduate next year, where I’ll write something more well-put and use words with a higher syllable count.As I look back on my time as managing editor, I see so many ways I could have done better. Maybe I should have dug a little deeper or wrote a few more stories. Maybe I should’ve trained people a little better or showed up a little earlier. But as my thought experiments (and “The Butterfly Effect”) have taught me, prescribing things I could’ve done differently is really just rolling the dice again with the possibility of worse outcomes. So I’m satisfied with how things have turned out.My journey with The Chronicle isn’t over yet as I transition into a role overseeing elections and centennial coverage next year, but the hardest challenges are behind me now. I’ll end with this ancient Chinese proverb that I searched up just for this column:“千里之行，始於足下.” — 老子“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” — LaoziMost would interpret this as telling people to take that risk, to take that first step toward success. But I view it more descriptively. You’ll never know which one step will take you down that journey of a thousand miles. I never would have thought that I would be in this position today. But if I’ve learned anything in the past few years, it’s that most things are out of your control — enjoy where life takes you!Jazper Lu is a Trinity junior and served as managing editor of The Chronicle’s 119th volume. He would first like to thank all members of uppermast, lowermast and staff for keeping the machine that is The Chronicle well-oiled, and for bringing 301 Flowers to life. He also wants to thank his predecessor, Katie Tan, for showing him the ropes and his successor, Michael Austin, for his willingness to step up to the challenges that he will soon face. He would also like to express his excitement for what Abby Spiller, Austin, Zoe Kolenovsky and the rest of The Chronicle’s 120th volume will be able to do over the next year. He would also like to give his required thanks to Chrissy Murray for looking over The Chronicle as generations of Duke students file in and out and call this paper home. Last but not least, he would like to thank Audrey Wang for righting the ship and sticking it out with him through all the ups and downs of the year."
Your invisible professor,Carol Apollonio,2024-04-24T04:00:00Z,Apr,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042424-apollonio-your-invisible-professor-20240424.html,"When I started at Duke 40 years ago, classes seemed important. Students were here to learn new things, and professors were here to help them do that. The new things included old things — history, classics, literature, philosophy, religion — along with the sciences and social sciences. Basketball was just another sport, along with golf and volleyball. We had a dreadful football team. The Bryan Center did not exist, and what we now call WU was a dark, scary, Gothic-tinged dungeon. There was a bat-and-mold-infested place called Central Campus where some students actually lived. Frats, by contrast, had the best residential spaces on West. Durham was a distant planet. The Art Museum was in one of the brick buildings on East. I parked every day on Chapel Drive — for free!Extracurriculars were informal. There were clubs with faculty advisors. You did not have to apply. I had a colleague who held a “Happy Hour” (счастливый час) on the front porch of the Language Building every Friday afternoon. He poured a free shot of chilled vodka to any student, irrespective of age, who stopped by. This was a kind of pre-gaming before student “kegs” later that evening, where the real drinking started. I have an old document, a message sent out by a dean before LDOC, limiting each student to no more than one-half case of beer over the course of the day (I think that’s 12 beers each). There was no Krzyzewskiville, or even Krzyzewski. East Campus was for the arts, and “freshmen” were thrown upon arrival onto West, where they were hazed and indoctrinated into the informal, secret, rock-solid rules of campus life. At some point a couple dozen of them (white males) were given academic robes and drilled in an elaborate quad-marching ritual, with yelps, which they continue to perform to this day on LDOC. Dorms did not have AC. Campus food was served in “cafeterias,” and it was rubbery.Refreshments were not served at guest lectures; students just came because they were curious, I guess. It was exciting when a professor showed a movie. There were no Certificates! We did not have a shadow business curriculum. Faculty did the advising. Professors — mostly white males — stood at the front of classrooms and read (yes, “read”) yellowed lecture notes — the same ones every year. One time a professor read the exact same entire lecture two class days in a row. People hired typists and everyone had a stash of white-out. We used “mimeographs” and “carbon paper” and “microfiche.” There was no internet. Letters were sealed in envelopes and dropped into mailboxes. Phones were things that stood on your desk, attached by a wire to the wall. Students knew where the libraries were and took books out of them! We had an actual bookstore. It sold the daily newspaper. Free T-shirts were not a thing. Concerts were classical. Coffee was coffee. Duke students could expect the full range of grades (A-F) in every class — from Chemistry and Econ to Literature and Music History. If you got a C, you figured that you had earned it. It wasn’t too hard to get into Duke; a full-on hippie like me could have been accepted in 1980. There were no websites and you registered for classes using paper cards. Faculty sat in Wilson gym and tried to persuade students to sign up for their classes. We dirty-recruited for Russian that way, pretending it would be fun. There weren’t a lot of administrators, and somehow things got done. A lot can change in 40 years. Duke has become a world-class institution. It is no coincidence that this has come along with our biggest change — from a mostly all-white, homogeneous English-speaking student body to a vibrant community of people of diverse backgrounds and identities from all over the world. Just walking between buildings, you hear a chorus of different languages. And students just keep on getting more brilliant and interesting. Our faculty has become more diverse too. Sometimes I hear from students about hierarchies and inequalities in their campus communities. Duke professors, too, find themselves arrayed along a socio-economic hierarchy that feels significantly more rigid than in years past. On your educational journey you will undoubtedly be taught by some low-paid laborers, most of whom — despite being just as brilliant as Duke’s full professors, and some of whom are among our best teachers — will never rise out of that marginalized social class or be integrated into Duke’s intellectual community. A few years ago, they voted for union representation, which allows them to tend to their basic human needs, earn predictable salaries, and get some benefits. Graduate students, who also teach you, have followed the same path. At the other end of the spectrum, the highest social classes at Duke are the tenured faculty, whose research dominates the university’s mission and profile, and of course the top administrators, whose salaries, which you pay, will leave you gasping for air.In between these extremes — the basement and the penthouse — toil your Professors of the Practice. Check the Department websites and see if your favorite professor might be a POP. We are performing artists, practicing professionals, scholars, writers, analysts, musicians, journalists, scientists, translators, and educators. Many of us are internationally recognized leaders in our fields. We straddle different worlds — the Duke classroom and our practice outside of academe. I was one of Duke’s first crop of POPs, and I have been proud to see us grow into our role as Duke’s elite educators. Now, as I say goodbye to my intellectual home, I want to share my admiration for these incredible, brilliant, underappreciated colleagues. Duke’s POPs (except possibly the famous ones) earn far lower salaries than the tenured faculty, yet we perform a disproportionate share of the institution’s boots-to-the-ground mission. We are often marginalized even within our own departments. POPs are master teachers. We are passionately involved with the cultural, arts, advising, and student communities across campus. These contributions tend to go unrewarded and uncredited at salary-decision time, as they go up different administrative “siloes.” The prestigious forms of service — that is, those that entail meeting with high-level Duke decision makers, dining with them at the Wa Duke, and going on retreats — are closed off to your POPs. We contribute quietly and invigorate every corner of your world.On my way out, I send out a big cheer to you, my invisible, brilliant, hard-working colleagues. I thank you for inspiring and supporting me all these years. And I challenge the administration to imagine what Duke would be without us, and to find ways to recognize and reward our service.

Training in a post-Roe landscape,Rebecca Fairchild,2024-04-23T05:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042324-fairchild-post-roe-landscape-training-20240423.html,"This guest column is part of a series of three OP-Eds about abortion care access in North Carolina submitted by members of the Reproductive Health Care Post-Roe (2023-2024) Bass Connections project. More information on the project and provider testimonies can be found on the project’s website.As a medical student, the first thing I promise to my patients and to society is to “do no harm.” It’s an ironic pledge. How do we learn to “do no harm” when we are taught by a medical system that inflicts harm on patients every day? Harm occurs when essential medications are too costly for patients to afford. Harm is done when provider biases cloud decision-making. Legislators inflict harm when abortion restrictions deny people bodily autonomy, and force providers to deny lifesaving care.Although it is clear that abortion restrictions cause inadequate care, it is harder to understand what optimal care would be—many of us never get to see it. Recent scholarship shows that 48% of medical students train in states with restrictive abortion legislation. In these environments, students have little opportunity to learn the clinical nuances of abortion care, meet patients seeking abortions, and work with the providers most expert in abortion medicine.When we lack formal education in abortion care, we learn instead through less expert sources, such as clinicians who do not perform abortions. This is a problem because doctors outside of OBGYN are not routinely updated on the latest data and practice standards in gynecologic care and their teaching can be outdated, unclear and misleading. As future physicians, we all carry what we learn, or fail to learn, into our conversations with patients and our students. Equipped with only a shaky understanding of abortion care, we not only risk mismanaging our patients but also risk perpetuating this cycle of misinformation that causes patient harm well into the future.I am lucky; I have been able to train in an abortion clinic as a medical student. The benefits of this clinical exposure were immediately apparent. Through counseling patients about abortion medications and watching providers deftly complete procedures, I gained comfort with the nuances of this medicine and an appreciation of the safety of abortions. Sitting with patients, I was reminded of the complexity and weight of the personal, economic, health, familial factors and value systems that influence these decisions. Making these decisions, nobody benefited from the litany of state-mandated “counseling”, which is belittling, works against evidence-based medicine, and is out of touch with the patient experience. It would be hard for any medical student to walk away from these experiences without the fundamental understanding that abortions are safe, deeply complex and personal and that regulations are painfully misaligned with patient needs.Even with clinical exposure to abortion, there are still gaps in medical education. In our training, we spend only a handful of days in abortion clinics and are in one hospital system, making it hard to contextualize the care we see with what existed historically or is available in different political climates. Further, we only meet the patients who were able to access care. We lose the voices of the people who are most deeply impacted — the patient who found out too late and is forced to cross state lines, the person without transportation to a care center, and so many others who have been systematically excluded from care. Because we enter this space so briefly, it is difficult — impossible even — to appreciate the gravity of what has been lost.These factors weigh heavily when selecting where to train for residency. Across medical specialties, residents avoid training in states with abortion restrictions due to concerns of compromised training, moral distress of denying care and their personal reproductive safety. These factors persist after the completion of training, with documented flight of physicians from states with abortion restrictions. In fact, such states have 32% fewer OBGYNs per births than states that protect abortions. These factors compound so that the people most likely to be harmed by dangerous abortion policy may also have the least access to doctors.As a reproductive-aged rising OBGYN, the consequences of the Dobbs decision on safe reproductive care are as personal as they are professional. For young people, the capacity to become pregnant carries inherent risks which are becoming more dangerous in regions where legislation restricts evidence-based reproductive care. With the increasingly fragmented map of reproductive care, abortion legislation impacts the places we choose to move, the jobs we take and our safety in the places we settle. While this landscape is deeply unsettling, power remains in reproductive advocacy. For people entering medical school, there is opportunity to push for change through engaging with Med Students for Choice, conducting research on abortion access, and working with curriculum committees to push for formal abortion education. For all people, continue to learn and talk about reproductive justice and abortion, make educated votes, and engage with and uplift the work of groups such as SisterSong to push for reproductive justice policy. With these efforts, not only are you advocating for the patients needing care now, but you are fighting for a workforce equipped to care for birthing people for the years and decades to come.Rebecca Fairchild is a 4th-year medical student at the Duke University School of Medicine and a member of the Reproductive Health Care Post-Roe (2023-2024) Bass Connections Project."
Things your civics teacher didn't tell you: The fight for bodily autonomy,Maite McPherson,2024-04-23T05:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042324-mcpherson-bodily-autonomy-fight-20240423.html,"This guest column is part of a series of three OP-Eds about abortion care access in North Carolina submitted by members of the Reproductive Health Care Post-Roe (2023-2024) Bass Connections project. More information on the project and provider testimonies can be found on the project’s website.Life-giving has long been legally regulated. North Carolina has a history of limiting birthing decisions, like restricting midwifery and abortion. Passed by just one vote over the governor’s veto in May 2023, the recent SB 20 abortion restriction is the latest wave of a legal culture that enforces a medical reality in which Black communities lose mothers and infants at disproportionately high rates. As Loretta Ross, founder of the reproductive justice (RJ) organization SisterSong asserted, “When politicians, judges, and policymakers … restrict access to various kinds of reproductive health care, they are building on the past” that victimized enslaved women through sexual violence and profitable birth. Politicians have long inflicted harm on Black birthing people, highlighting the importance of engaging in political resistance and uplifting the tireless work of reproductive justice advocates. In recent history, the state of North Carolina coerced the sterilization of young, minoritized women. These were traumatic systems that Black women champions for racial justice like Harriet Tubman, Fannie Lou Hamer and Ella Baker had to navigate, as they worked to improve our systems of health and democracy. As marginalized communities advance just values, legislators respond through manipulative legislation. Ironically, the democratically elected officials seem to succumb to corruption to suppress alternative community-based systems that embody the core tenets of democratic procedures. The most recent act of suppression of communities’ reproductive autonomy has been the non-democratic enactment of North Carolina’s abortion restriction, SB 20. This law prevents providers from following accepted best medical practices by banning abortion past 12 weeks and paternalistically enforcing an arbitrary 72-hour wait time in between insensitive abortion ""counseling"" and an abortion procedure. Ironically, state legislators pushed the legislation through in 48 hours — less time than it mandates pregnant people to wait (72 hours) in between appointments. The passage of this bill can only be described as a deceitful undermining of our democracy to strip our basic right to bodily autonomy. Republicans took advantage of abortion as a hot-button topic to circumvent democratic norms. One elected official betrayed her political promises, making a back-door deal to switch political parties and vote against her constituents’ values. In keeping with this political shadiness, SB 20 was stealthily introduced as a conference committee report in order to skirt the committee process, which would’ve required the bill to pass through the health subcommittee. This decision meant there was zero public commentary from those who can get pregnant or medical experts, no debate and no possibility of amendments to the bill — necessary checks of the legislative process. Furthermore, the decision also ignored best medical practices and community interests by restricting many birthing people to the dangerous reality of forced pregnancy. This goes directly against the efforts of Black women-led organizations, such as SisterSong, which have long worked to democratize and improve both health systems and government. In response to each legal restriction like SB 20, Black community organizers have provided care for Black mothers in North Carolina through a dynamic, persisting culture across generations. Despite the expertise and impact of the leaders, they were excluded from the SB-20 “legislative process.” It is imperative to build on these voices which are often intentionally and systematically sidelined when engaging in advocacy. To learn more about this network of community organizers, I interviewed community organizers in Durham on ways community-based responses counteract white supremacy and sexism-deforming maternal health. Black feminists like Audre Lorde have long emphasized that the liberation of everyone is contingent upon the liberation of the highest targets of oppression. Southern Black and Brown working-class women who organize for social justice demonstrate that the strongest and most resistant community-based alternative systems are created by these groups who have been innovating to not just survive but thrive with under-resourced realities for centuries. This is why the mother organization of Reproductive Justice (RJ) operates from its home in the South (North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky). As Simran Singh Jain of SisterSong reminds us, the South is where the most impacted by reproductive injustice live, but it’s also the site of resilience. SisterSong emerged to oppose “a hostile Conservative government that’s holding people hostage.” The RJ movement originated in the South because, “That’s where every major social movement in this country has come from … that’s where the power is.” SisterSong’s North Carolina Coordinator Maya Hart underlines the history of reproductive advocacy in the South. Hart, a doula, explains that doulas and midwives are crucial to the safety of members of oppressed communities. These key community health workers have provided 12 generations of birthing care to the Black community, passing down ancestral traditions of midwifery to birthing people forced to live under violent circumstances. They are inspired by “the history of resistance in the South” which has been embodied by RJ advocates historically “since before we even had the language for it.” Camille, Policy Director for the Carolina Abortion Fund, and a doula, is an example of the connections among these generations. She spoke to me about how family lineage connects her to the present day. Her “great-great-grandmother was a slave midwife” and lived to be 110, witnessing multiple eras of birthing care in the South. This included white authorities who sought to undermine the birthing work of Black women (many in rural areas) by excluding them from that work, “so there could not be midwives.” Despite the midwives' health outcomes exceeding those of white physicians, the latter tried “to push them out of their work and medicalized the field” in order to have economic control over reproductive care. Like many midwives, she brought both Black and white children into the world safely, so she had the first integrated funeral in Jim Crow South Carolina when she passed. These women — Adair, Hart, Ross, among other RJ leaders — all exemplify the key role of Black women as community advocates who have challenged oppressive power structures to provide better care for all. Impressive innovation for community-building which is already taking place in the state could enact larger scale impact if policy efforts worked in conjunction with community needs rather than counteracting the progress of social justice organizing. The history in North Carolina of both Black midwives and Black women pushing for civil rights is a testament to the community systems of care established by and for Black women stretching back to enslavement. Despite malicious restrictions enacted by the far-right that echo Jim Crow medicine and government, marginalized communities — groups who have never been properly served by formal institutions — are actively building on a history of thriving to create alternative systems of care. Despite the efficacy, ingenuity and bravery of these Black leaders from the South, national conversation — especially from Democratic politicians — dismisses the South as culturally and socially “backward.” This misread allows the harmful actions of reactionary politicians to dominate the narrative. The “backwardness” is simply the response of reactionary politicians to generations of powerful Black-led freedom efforts through Reconstruction and Fusion political eras, to the civil rights and Black Lives Matter movements of today. As you engage in political conversation and advocacy, I urge you to uplift this nuanced and powerful history of resistance. North Carolina’s present and past echo what voting rights activist Nsé Ufot points out: “The darkness we’re experiencing, it’s not dusk, it’s dawn … we are headed into what full participatory democracy could look like.” There are many ways to translate your concern about our rights to bodily autonomy to action. There are many RJ organizations creating an impact in the Research Triangle to learn from and support with our dedication and resources as community members. Even right here on campus, our Bass Connections team has drafted a Call to Action that can inform your ideas of ways to lift your voice up.Maite McPherson is a Trinity senior and a member of the Reproductive Health Care Post-Roe (2023-2024) Bass Connections Project."
Breaking down barriers: Reproductive justice amidst systemic challenges,Miracle Adedeji,2024-04-23T05:00:00Z,Apr,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042324-adedeji-reproductive-justice-systemic-challenges-20240423.html,"This guest column is part of a series of three OP-Eds about abortion care access in North Carolina submitted by members of the Reproductive Health Care Post-Roe (2023-2024) Bass Connections project. More information on the project and provider testimonies can be found on the project’s website.Picture this: It’s a frantic Monday morning, and you find yourself navigating traffic, desperately trying to make it to work on time. The stakes are high — a presentation crucial for a life-altering promotion awaits. As you speed towards the office, mere minutes away, a sudden construction roadblock appears. It shatters your hopes of reaching that critical meeting. Now imagine you look around, and while the other cars around only have to wait 10 minutes to get past the block, you have to wait an hour. Your frustration is palpable. You feel your transformative professional opportunity slipping out of your hands, out of your control. Now, transpose this experience to the realm of reproductive rights, where new legislative restrictions in North Carolina cast formidable obstacles for those seeking abortions. Black women — comprising 39% of abortion patients in the United States — were already facing challenges in accessing reproductive health services before the overturning of Roe v. Wade due to limited facilities, particularly in communities with restricted health resources. The escalation of state-level anti-abortion measures has exacerbated these barriers, posing additional hardships for Black women seeking essential reproductive care. Your hour-long wait — in stark contrast to the mere 10 minutes for those around you — mirrors the challenges faced by Black individuals specifically in accessing proper reproductive care. Systemic biases ingrained in the healthcare system often prevent many patients in the Black community from receiving the reproductive care they need. Sadly, there are now numerous stories of healthcare providers invalidating the pain of Black mothers, perceiving them as less competent in understanding their own bodies and treating these patients unfairly based on preconceived notions and racist ideologies. A 2016 study found that medical students and residents who endorsed false beliefs about biological differences between black and white people exhibited a racial bias in pain perception. This subsequently contributes to racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment. For instance, in October 2019, Shamony Gibson began to experience sharp chest pain after the birth of her second child by c-section. When she went to the hospital and explained the situation to the medical staff, her doctors persistently asked if she was on drugs, digging their heels into a stereotypical assumption of Ms. Gibson’s lifestyle as a Black woman. Eventually, after her concerns were repeatedly dismissed by her physicians, she died of a pulmonary embolism — a blood clot that travels to the lungs. It is a relatively common complication following significant surgeries like a c-section, a situation that could have been avoided had someone paid attention to her symptoms before it was too late. Shamony Gibson’s tragic story serves as just one of the many examples where Black patients’ concerns are not taken seriously, a pattern that is both dehumanizing and, in some cases, lethal. Consequently, the unequal level of health care received by Black patients contributes to adverse maternal health outcomes for Black mothers. In 2021, the nationwide maternal mortality rate for Black women was 69.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is 2.6 times the rate for non-Hispanic White women. In North Carolina, where 22% of the population is Black, Black women made up 43% of pregnancy-related deaths between 2020 and 2022. As a Black woman who desires to have children someday, I sincerely hope that neither I nor any other Black individual will have to endure the same kind of treatment as Ms. Gibson did. Fortunately, strides toward addressing racial disparities in reproductive healthcare have been made. California’s comprehensive report titled “Centering Black Mothers” systematically compiles evidence from vital statistics, administrative and survey datasets, and peer-reviewed scientific literature and uses the term “centering” to underscore a focused approach on Black mothers that incorporates their perspectives. Black Mammas Matter Alliance (BMMA) is a network of Black women-led birth and reproductive justice organizations and multi-disciplinary professionals, working across the full spectrum of maternal and reproductive health. BMMA provides technical assistance, training and capacity building for grassroots organizations, maternity care service providers (clinicians, midwives, doula networks and community health workers), academia and the public health industry. 50 years from now, I desire a healthcare landscape where my blackness, and that of others, is not a factor that diminishes my worthiness of care from any doctor. I aspire to a healthcare system where Black women are not restricted from the abortion care they need. It is my hope that no mother will lose their life due to the actions of racist doctors. Instead, I dream of a reality where every Black mother receives evidence-based care, unburdened by the hour-long roadblocks caused by racist ideologies, enabling them to lead healthy and fulfilling lives.I urge the Duke and Durham communities to direct their attention towards reproductive justice, as it profoundly impacts individuals both on campus and within the city at large. For Duke students, faculty, and staff, reproductive justice is not merely a distant concern but a pressing reality that can shape their access to essential healthcare services. Similarly, residents of Durham are directly impacted by the systemic barriers in the healthcare system that affect their access to proper reproductive care. By engaging in discussions and taking action to address these systemic barriers, we can work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive community where everyone has access to the reproductive healthcare they need and deserve.

Waiting For May flowers,Anna Garziera,2024-04-23T04:00:00Z,Apr,23,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042324-garziera-waiting-for-may-flowers-20240423.html,"We blinked and all that time was somehow gone. At the end of April, times are hard: students feel buried by final assignments, projects and exams. These April showers are drowning us. Yet, we keep marching, fueled by the promise of May flowers.With only just over a week left of the spring semester, we don’t know what to make of these final days. The cherry blossoms have come and gone, and so has our academic motivation. The trees are turning green again, full of life. We can almost taste our sweet reward: a relaxing, three-month long summer.On one hand, we’d like to get lost in the slow going of spring. We’d like this last week to be the cool down to the challenging race we’ve been running since early fall. On the other hand, we know the race isn’t quite over yet: with only a few hundred yards left, everyone is cheering — it is time to sprint to the finish line.For that reason, LDOC welcomes vigorous celebration at Duke. From pancake art demonstrations to bubble soccer tournaments to live concerts on the main quad, the Duke LDOC (Last Day of Classes) party is an all-day affair.The biggest event of the year, the LDOC party, brings the Duke student body together like nothing else. Almost all students come out to celebrate. While most students can’t shake the underlying dread that comes with LDOC — the end of classes marking the beginning of finals season — the air is thick with the exhilaration that comes every year with the end of school.As scary as final exams can be, most U.S. college students will be able to breathe again after the first week of May. However, most Duke students can’t say the same. With Duke culture putting immense pressure on students to get ahead with internships, summer classes and corporate jobs, the expectation is that we have a productive summer. After exams, we’ll turn our key again, feeling like wind-up toys, and dive into coding camps, public policy internships or intensive summer classes. We just can’t get a break.Burnout is rampant in college students around the U.S. With a recent increasing awareness of students’ mental health issues, a wave of support systems has been implemented in most campuses. Duke is no exception: we have more resources than ever before. However, we still find ourselves unhappy, strained and overwhelmed.Perhaps, we need something simpler: the permission to take a break.One might argue that if students decide to have a busy summer, then that’s their decision. If they don’t need a pause, good for them. Let them plough on. But the reality is that some students apply to monotonous corporate jobs and tedious internships not because they want to, but because they’ll feel disadvantaged if they don’t. The competition is bloodthirsty. There’s no catching up once you get left behind.Our choice is then between having a long, pleasant, relaxing summer or giving up our time to some hyper-productive project that will fluff our resume. For international students, this could mean not seeing their parents and friends until mid-August. For local students, this might just mean having a 9-to-5 dull office job distantly related to their field — and giving up being a camp counselor at the summer camp they’ve been going to since childhood.It’s not fair to say that students should never look for an internship to enrich their experience, nor that it’s useless to get ahead with summer credits. But every decision has an opportunity cost. If that political science course in D.C. will knock two months off your summer, then you should probably reconsider taking it.At least, ask yourself if you’ll be ready to jump back in the race come September.Now, we find ourselves confronted by the final stretch of the semester and all the worries it brings. Will I do well on my finals? Will I get that internship I applied for? Whether or not we are ready, summer is here. Let us at least be assured by the fact that after our toil and labor, will come, if not a well-deserved break, immense satisfaction. Stay strong, as you sit through the final April showers. The May flowers will be blooming soon.Anna Garziera is a Trinity first-year. Her column typically runs on alternate Wednesdays."
Faith over religion,Paul Dilly,2024-04-23T04:00:00Z,Apr,23,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042324-dilly-faith-over-religion-20240423.html,"I grew up religious, hard. I was raised Catholic by my parents who were also raised Catholic. I went to church every Sunday without question. I attended a private Catholic school for over ten years, from pre-kindergarten through eighth grade. Even my public high school boasted a predominantly Christian student body. My friends — whether from school, sports, or the neighborhood — were all religious, courtesy of my Bible Belt–residing town. As such, my beliefs were never challenged — by myself or others — and, as a result, I lived a supposed religious life without ever knowing what that meant. It took leaving that world behind and coming to Duke to understand what the prayer recitals and religion classes and Bible camps couldn’t teach me: Faith is something only I could only discover for myself.My life back home had hinged on a religion that had been chosen for me, and I came to view it as a part of my identity over which I had no control. College gave me the chance to break free of that expectation and define that part of myself in my own way; away from family and friends, I no longer felt pressured, obligated, to follow the religious script I’d followed since birth. So I didn’t. I stopped going to church regularly. I became a part of friend groups in which most were non-believers. I hardly prayed, and I forgot the creeds we invoked at mass. Not because I wanted to spite Catholicism, but because I wanted to see what the other side looked like. Turns out, I didn’t like it that much. But, like Amish teens during Rumspringa, I needed to see it for myself.I remained in this religious limbo until last semester. It was right before fall break, and I was staring down three tough exams in the span of two days. I had spent the entire week prior studying. Yet, no matter how much I prepared, I felt it wouldn’t be enough — there was just too much material left to cover. I felt exhausted, overwhelmed, defeated. Desperate, I decided to offer up a prayer: “God, please help me through these next few days. Help me to study as best I can and somehow do well on these exams.” Then I put my head down and got back to studying. When I came back from break, I was greeted with scores better than anything I could’ve hoped for.Thinking the prayers might have worked, I kept it up. I sprinkled prayers into other areas of my life. I prayed to be healed of health issues no doctor could diagnose. I prayed to improve my relationships with my friends and family, to be more honest with them. Though none of my subsequent prayers have worked out quite as magically as that first time back, I gradually came to develop a certain confidence that, even though I couldn’t directly see it in the moment, God was gradually stitching together the visions of my prayers into the fabric of my life, one thread at a time. This newfound trust ultimately spurred me to return to Catholicism — this time, though, I was going to do it a bit differently.Throughout my first 19 years, I thought religion was the end goal. I thought of God only in terms of religious requirements: going to church, reading the Bible, etc. And I learned that doing these things would mold me into a good Christian and help me go to heaven. Yet, despite the supposed benefits, I could not find God through these things. Sure, I listened to priests speak about God, read about God, prayed prayers written for God. But I did not truly know him, only what my religion said about him; thus, my religion confined the extent of my faith. It was only when I discovered God for myself that I came to understand how faith transcends the boundaries of religion. Through my time spent praying, I realized God doesn’t care how many times I’d missed mass or how many pages of the Bible I read each day. All God cared about was me. He wanted to know me, and in order to do that I had to talk to him and tell him what I was feeling and what I needed. It was that simple. Armed with this revelation, I returned to church with a shift in perspective: I was no longer there to fulfill some obligatory duty put forth by Catholic leadership, but to be with God and feel his presence in a peaceful place. In this way, I was now in it for God, not some religious label.My mistake? I misconstrued religion for faith. I thought religion alone was enough and ignored a relationship with God as a result. Religion is meant to be a supplement to your faith; it is not meant to be a replacement. Religion, by definition, brings together groups of people who share a set of beliefs in some higher power. Consequently, religion is inherently a collective experience you share with such a group. Faith, on the other hand, is an individualized experience, an exploration of a personal relationship with said higher power. Religion is thus incapable of giving you the intimacy required by faith. Instead, you must establish a personal relationship with your God — on your own.I find going to church and prayer to be ways in which I can strengthen my faith and relationship with God. Maybe you’re conventional too. Or maybe you go on hikes to appreciate nature or lock yourself in a pitch-black room to bask in the peace of silence and stillness. Whatever your modus operandi is, do it. The stipulations of a religion are not worth following if doing so harms your relationship with your God. Give yourself the freedom to pursue your relationship, your way. When you do, I promise you will be filled with a deeper sense of faith and belief that goes beyond the teachings of any religion.Paul Dilly is a Trinity sophomore.

A column about columns,Heidi Smith,2024-04-22T04:00:00Z,Apr,22,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042224-smith-a-column-about-columns-20240422.html,"Since I started writing for The Chronicle my sophomore year, one of my friends has insisted I write a column about columns. The closest I’ve gotten is an OP-Ed about the QuadEx arches, but with my final piece for The Chron now here, I figured it was time to finally write my column column. While I know he means the doric and ionic variety, I must, as always, write what I know, which is the type of column you’re reading right now.After writing OP-Eds for three years, I’ve realized I don’t have an opinion on everything, nor do I need to. This may sound rich coming from someone who’s posted 40 of them — yes, the amount is so large now that I can use numerals rather than letters to represent it — but it rings true. I only really have opinions about things for which I have a horse in the race. I don’t know much about architecture, so this piece will not be about columns of the pillar, post and pole variety — sorry for the Connections spoiler for April 17.Many seniors still involved in The Chronicle have probably gotten very different things from it than I have. When reading farewell posts in years past, I’ve always noticed the personal element of it all — i.e., it’s been about the friends we met along the way. For me, it hasn’t been about that. I’m friends or friendly with many other Chronicle writers but rarely interact with them in Chronicle contexts. Writing my OP-Eds has been a means of deep self-reflection, and that’s what I’ve gotten from my time as a columnist.Since September 2021, I have published an article every two weeks, except for school breaks. I have never skipped a cycle or turned in a piece late. Doing this has been a major exercise in self-control and motivation in a space where it’s not required. It has been important to me to show myself that I can prioritize something that no one is making me do and has no consequences for incompletion.Because I made this commitment to myself — and commitment is hard! — I grew immensely as a writer and person through this experience. It’s not easy to think of something mildly-Duke-related and somewhat substantive every other week, but it has forced me to pay attention to my surroundings. What are people angry about? What are people excited about? What do we unquestioningly accept? I’ve had a lot of good conversations with friends that give me the seed of an idea for a piece or gotten a new perspective on one of my opinions from someone who reads it and starts a conversation.After so long, my column has shown me the power of writing. Sometimes, my pieces struck a nerve, and sometimes accord, but the act of consistency allowed me to develop a platform of sorts that, if nothing else, got many people on campus thinking about the things I wrote. I always have to laugh when one of my friends texts me that they heard someone discussing one of my pieces around campus or I meet someone and they say, “Oh, you’re the Heidi who wrote that Chronicle piece” (that Chronicle piece typically being “Go to class”). Honestly, I’m tickled that people outside of my immediate friends read what I have to say.I thought I might like to reread all my columns for this piece and reflect on how I’ve grown throughout the years. However, at about 1,000 words a pop, they total the length of about half a novel, which feels outrageously long. I’m not a huge researcher when it comes to writing things like this — and I usually have to force myself to find some statistic that supports the argument I’d rather prove through my rhetoric — but what I’ll say is that, in rereading a few of my pieces, I was able to see the longitudinal impact of creating such a breadth of similar works. While I’m no diarist, when I read an old piece, I’m reminded of who I was when I wrote it — where the idea came to me, the writing process, what the reception was. My column has preserved the various selves I’ve shed and morphed into in the past years. While some OP-Eds I wouldn’t rewrite today, I understand why the person I was at that moment needed to write them.While not a literal column, my biweekly OP-Eds have proved to be a point of stability in my life. No matter what else was going on, I always ensured I would have time to write my piece and that it would be time spent doing something for myself. If I could make time for this, an extracurricular activity that was for no one but myself, I could make time for anything if I cared about it enough. It doesn’t matter what it is, but you need to care about something to make the hard work worth it.In this, one of many lasts I will experience in these weeks, I am saying goodbye to a form — the OP-Ed — that I may not revisit. I am grateful for the discipline being a columnist has taught me and for the fire that has been lit under me to continue developing my writing through whichever mediums are most relevant to my current life. I am grateful for the support that friends and strangers have shown my column and the constructive criticism that certain pieces have elicited alike. My goal with my pieces has often been to open a dialogue about campus issues, and I hope the opinion section of The Chronicle continues to embrace productive discourse.Heidi Smith is a Trinity senior.

"‘I’m Just Like Spider-Man,’ says anonymous columnist","Monday Monday, Zoe Tishaev",2024-04-22T04:00:00Z,Apr,22,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/042124-monday-monday-reveal-20240422.html,"""Oh, I know you! I recognize you from ___.""You fill in the blank.At a school that seems just small enough that everyone seems to know someone who knows someone else, it’s hard to escape the preconceived image of yourself. Sometimes when I meet someone I would be recognized from bartending, or ""the GroupMe,"" or from Bella Union, or posters from a DSG campaign, or from tabling on BC, but nobody could ever recognize me for being the anonymous columnist.Oftentimes, I would be finishing a piece at a Saturday night gathering in advance of my Sunday deadline. My friends would be confused as to why I was hiding my laptop. Whenever they got too close, I would quickly switch to porn to avoid arousing any suspicions. Anonymity is hard but important. Monday Monday is where opinions become disconnected from the author. Monday Monday gives a mouthpiece and a pen to the disgruntled frustrations and murmurs that typically die in a conversation with friends or disappear in a few hours off SideChat. They say criticism comes from a place of love. Perhaps that is true. How else do I explain the many rants that my friends become begrudging audiences for about another waste of time meeting in DSG, or another frustrating conversation with an administrator, or another sudden and inexplicable closure, construction project or policy shift. But these were just rants, the same rants spouted by thousands of others at Duke. Monday Monday was, hopefully, a means to capture these rants in a way that made people smile a little, to make people feel less alone in their frustrations with the university.Satire is a tool, not only to criticize but also to organize and inform. Some Monday Mondays of the past bemoan that students don’t really read the column. I disagree. What people don't read is the news. At least, that's what I did. After all, why learn when you can laugh? I know people read Monday Monday because people would tell me. More than a handful of times someone would reference a joke I wrote or ask me if I had read the latest article, and I would respond, ""Yeah, not funny. Monday Monday sucks, and they're probably stupid and ugly too.""Monday Monday is very special because it is the one column in the Chronicle that is handed off year after year. Often looking for inspiration for an article I would return to the staff page of Monday Monday and read back through 10-to-15-year-old articles that mock a commencement speaker or a silly decision by admin. Like fossils in amber, these satirical pieces preserve the feelings of the time in print, allowing us to look back and compare our own situations today that are, sometimes, not too dissimilar from the frustrations of generations prior. My arrival at Duke was marked by masks on faces, cotton swabs up noses and a deep sense of fear and uncertainty. Since then, Duke has changed a lot. SLG, Greek and Independent house seals have disappeared off the sides of West Campus buildings. Curb cuts in front of the Chapel have been removed, making campus more inaccessible. The field in front of Gilbert-Addoms where my classmates once gathered in a desperate cling for social life during a pandemic has been paved over and replaced by a brick plaza that rarely sees use. Swift lost a gym and a pool. We banned nuts. Some things are small. Some things are bigger. But when tuition continues to grow and Duke grows ever more selective, these changes should not be met with a shrug and a sigh, but with skepticism and interrogation.Call me a romantic. A critic. Nostalgic for some amorphous time “before” — but I think it’s true. Duke has changed. Sometimes for the better, often for the worse. In a way, that made my job easy. There is so much about Duke to mock. There is also much to love, and that is why it is all the more important we push it to be better. As I leave Monday Monday, I hope this column brought some solace to your week. I hope you could join me in being angry with Duke, laughing at its absurdity and then demanding it be better. Rejected from The Fluke twice, chronic bench napper, DSG expat: My name is Zoe Tishaev (sometimes known as my mobile order name, “Candice Nutzfitinyomouf”), and it has been an honor to serve as your Monday Monday.Lastly, I must make a few thank yous: Thank you to friends who called my articles “not funny” and “very bad” without knowing it was me, because it pushed me to be better.Thank you to the various Duke administrators — especially Mary Pat McMahon, Gary Bennett, Chris Rossi and Mark Hough, who probably never read Monday Monday, and are frequently the subjects of much criticism but were still always willing to have a conversation and talk through decisions with those who ask. Thank you to Kerinna Good, the one friend I told, for being a sounding board for bad jokes and for keeping her lips sealed on my identity. Thank you to the previous Monday Mondays for bringing light to this school when it feels like all shadows. I hope I was half as good as the authors who came before me.

Performative action: Duke’s misunderstanding of the Reginaldo Howard Scholarship,Craig Vincent,2024-04-19T05:00:00Z,Apr,19,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/041924-vincent-reginaldo-howard-scholarship-20240419.html,"Critics of affirmative action argue that universities reduce people down to their race. By eliminating the Reginaldo Howard Memorial Scholarship program, Duke has proved them right. Last week, Duke announced that Duke is eliminating the Reginaldo Howard Memorial Scholarship program, citing “changes to the legal landscape.” This news comes as a shock to current and former Reggies who were not consulted in the process. The decision also betrays a dark truth that Duke University does not and has not seen the Reggie program or its scholars for anything more than the color of their skin.This is not merely a guess or estimation but something that has been discussed. Back when I was a student, I remember attending an event with the Office of University Scholars & Fellows where they were highlighting the different merit scholarship groups. I recall the Director of the OUSF at the time giving lauded intros of the scholarship groups:“We have the AB Duke Scholars who are notable for their commitment to academics and leadership!” “The BN Duke Scholars students from North & South Carolina who are committed to service to the world!”“The University Scholars who are pushing the bounds of research and interdisciplinary studies!” “And the Reggie Howard Scholars for African Americans.” Even in the moment, I was bothered by the lack of similarly exultant adjectives and raised the issue at the time. But time has shown how absurd this reduction is. Among the Reginaldo Howard Scholars that shared time at Duke with me, three (others) are CEOs, four have Ph.D.s, and one is an internationally recognized author — not to mention the countless doctors, lawyers, political organizers and musicians who excel in their respective fields. The results are clear: The students admitted into the Reggie program are a gift to Duke’s campus and alumni base. But where I see a commitment to social, academic and professional excellence, Duke University only sees race. When Duke decided to lead the pack in not considering race in scholarship programs, Duke could not find any other trait, principle or value worth honoring in the Reginaldo Howard Memorial Scholarship program. Instead, they chose to shut down the program, ending a tight-knit community and alienating scores of alums and donors like me. The people who were lucky enough to know Reginaldo Howard remarked that he saw people for who they were. He didn’t reduce people to the color of their skin. Duke should learn from Reginaldo Howard’s memory and continue the Reginaldo Howard Scholarship centered around the values and principles that Howard himself espoused. Rather than shut down the Reginaldo Howard Memorial Scholarship program, Duke should carry on Howard’s legacy and do what he would have wanted: expand the scholarship to be more inclusive and continue to positively impact the lives of a diverse group of students for generations to come.Craig Vincent is the current co-founder and CEO of Aficio Inc. and a Duke alum who graduated from the Pratt School of Engineering with his B.S.E. in 2016 and his master of engineering management in 2018. He is also an alum of the Reginaldo Howard Memorial Scholarship program."
Higher education has an intellectual elitism problem,Alex Berkman,2024-04-19T04:00:00Z,Apr,19,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/041924-berkman-higher-ed-elitism-20240419.html,"“Raise your hand if you know an intelligent person that will be voting for President Donald J. Trump.”Slowly but surely, all the while looking around for some gesture of approval from peers, approximately a third of the 40-person class raised their hands.Now to preface, I consider myself politically independent, closer to the middle than to either pole of the ideological spectrum. I am also far from a fiery Trump supporter. But none of this is relevant. After all, the objective of my professor Dr. Michael Munger’s thought experiment was not to gauge the political leanings of his students, nor was it to poke fun at those willing to admit that they are friends with potential Trump voters. Rather, the purpose had been to challenge the 2/3 of the class who did not raise their hands. Namely, for this group, one or both of the following conditions must be true:1. Such student chooses to not engage with any person that would consider voting for President Trump.And/Or2. Such student cannot fathom that someone could be both (i) intelligent and (ii) a Trump voter.Yet, here are the facts: In 2020, 74.2 million Americans went to the ballots and voted for President Trump. And if our current polling data is accurate (though this is an entirely separate discussion), Donald J. Trump will likely be elected back into office this coming November. Therefore, if two thirds of the class truly cannot conceive that “someone could be both intelligent and a Trump voter,” this presents a reality whereby many university students consider themselves intellectually and/or morally superior. “You are right, Alex. I absolutely and unequivocally consider myself above the average American.”“I admire your shamelessness. But may I ask why?”“Well, for starters, I recently completed Math 545 at the top of my class, had memorized Plato’s 'The Republic' by the time I was 12, and just last Friday, NASA awarded me with a grant to perform independent research. Oh, and I am a freshman.”Okay, well I did not realize Jimmy Neutron attended Duke. Nonetheless, when a student body demonstrates a consistent inability to empathize, resonate, or at the very least be open to understanding the rationale of over half of America’s voting constituents, there may be but one takeaway — that higher education is comprised of an intellectually elitist body, not an intellectually open one. And of note, there may be no political issue that better exemplifies this as well as the disconnect between higher education and the ordinary American than climate change.It is no secret that young people are passionate about climate change. “Divest” is likely Gen Z’s favorite word, and just this past Sunday, student groups held an Alumni Weekend Protest calling for Duke to (you guessed it!) “divest” from fossil fuels and incorporate sustainable campus infrastructure. But should we be surprised by this? After all, our generation will be the ones that inherit a planet burdened by the environmental recklessness of those before us. So, to the students who have dedicated so much time and effort to this cause, I commend you. Truly. What I take issue with is the dialogue surrounding those who do not view climate change as a top priority. Namely, I’ve observed a certain sentiment in higher education arguing that those who are unwilling to protect our planet at the cost of individual financial loss must simply be short-sighted, misinformed or just plain selfish. Now, we can argue the validity of these claims on an individual level, but what we must not do is make condescending generalizations without attempting to understand the alternative view. Quite simply, refusing to prioritize climate change does not equal climate change denial. In fact, 85% of Americans believe climate change poses some form of threat, and 74% of Americans support coordinated international efforts to reduce climate change. Still, according to a February Pew Research Poll, climate change only ranked 17th out of 21 issues Americans think should be prioritized by the President and Congress. In other words, Americans recognize that climate change is real, but it is admittedly not on the forefront of their minds. Let’s examine why.Here’s a hypothetical that may illustrate the perspective of the person previously described. You may pick but one to survive: 50 strangers or one member of your immediate family. You have 10 minutes to decide, and your time starts … now!Now, this precise scenario is not realistic, at least I’d hope not. However, when a coal miner from West Virginia or an oil driller from Texas heads to the ballots, a similar conundrum (one with much lower stakes) is faced. By supporting progressive climate change reform and a Green New Deal, you are asking that they sacrifice their job security and family’s livelihood (the one family member) in order to spare future generations from climate disaster (the 50 strangers). Moreover, we must recognize that good climate change policy is not always consistent with a strong economy, which has consistently ranked as the most important issue for American voters. For example, the replacement of all fossil fuel power systems in the United States could cost up to 4.7 trillion dollars and by 2050 would displace more than 1.7 million American workers. Thus, the pushback among some parts of the American populace, especially those in the fossil fuel industry, is understandable and rational. Now, in response, a climate expert will likely argue that renewable energy will actually save trillions in the long run and create jobs for working Americans, a completely valid point in its own right. But, as we return to the hypothetical that had been posed, we should also be empathic of the right-leaning West Virginia coal miner, who chooses to prioritize the well-being of his own family over the potential well being of future families. By the way Mom and Dad, I would have chosen the family member in a heartbeat (of course under the condition that that family member was my dog Ollie).Notably, I am not here to deliberate over whether the coal miner’s reasoning is “right” or “just.” Taking sides or posing judgements has never been the purpose of this piece. The purpose, rather, is to simply suggest that we be more open to hearing the lived experiences and perspectives of real people — that we not immediately dismiss someone solely based on the box they will check on Tuesday, November 5. And with this, I raise the question of how we go about becoming more intellectually open and less intellectually elitist. Perhaps most importantly, we must continue to relentlessly support free speech, even if it means giving a platform to those with whom we disagree. According to an annual undergraduate survey conducted at the Buckley Institute at Yale University, in 2023, 46% of students agreed that, “It is sometimes acceptable to shout down or disrupt a speaker on my campus.” Now, I first take the time to affirm that hate speech is not okay. However, this intolerant environment is likely not motivated by anti-hate speech. For example, in this same survey, a plurality of college students, 48% to 44% agreed that they “cannot bring [themselves] to being close friends with someone who affiliates with a different political party than them.” And perhaps you disagree, but I would argue that it is completely unreasonable to say that someone is inherently hateful for being a member of a different party. However, despite these clearly strong views on partisan issues, 61% of respondents stated they are often intimidated from sharing beliefs different from their professors in class. What I am hearing right now is two things: (i) students are censoring other students and (ii) students are censoring themselves — both of which are directly at odds with the type of learning atmosphere we should be seeking to create. So, as I wrap up this piece, may I make clear that I do not ask that any of you compromise on your own views. I simply request that you recognize that disagreement is more often rooted in a difference in values and circumstance than it is in ignorance and/or unintelligence. With this, I urge that you be open to engaging with those outside of your sphere and with those who do disagree. After all, a middle ground may never be found if we do not take the time to stop and simply listen.Simply listen. I hope you enjoyed the read.Alex Berkman is a Trinity sophomore.

The beauty of Amtrak and our obsession with efficiency,Nathan Luzum,2024-04-19T04:00:00Z,Apr,19,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/041924-luzum-amtrak-efficiency-20240419.html,"For years, the passage of Amtrak trains through Durham have helped me to mark key timepoints of the day. Living in the 300 Swift apartment complex as a sophomore and junior, I was roused by the Amtrak’s harsh horn at around 7:00 a.m. and later cued to prepare for bed by the seemingly more dulcet tones of the 9:30 p.m. train. Even after I moved away from Swift and lived in various parts of Durham, the train schedule continued to assert its presence in my day.Ironically, I hardly used the train for its primary purpose — as a means of transport, not a timer, as my only Amtrak trip from Durham was a brief day trip to Charlotte in 2022. When I was looking for a way to get to Washington, D.C. for the ACC men’s basketball tournament last month, it seemed like a great opportunity for a train ride. There are a lot of good reasons to take the train. These range from the conscientious (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) to the practical (driving from Durham to D.C. is an objectively awful experience) to the whimsical (maybe there will be a murder on the train and you’ll get to work alongside a world-famous detective interviewing suspects, revealing a vast web of lies while also unveiling fundamental truths about yourself and human nature). It was some combination of the three that persuaded me to book the ticket.If you’ve heard anything about the Durham-D.C. Amtrak route, it’s probably that this stretch — like many other passenger train routes across the country — is quite slow. While the drive generally maxes out at five hours depending on traffic, the train takes more than seven. Some of these time limitations are intrinsic to rail. Trains can only go as fast as the class of the rail on which they run, which is determined by the specifics of how the tracks were constructed and maintained. Most of the Durham-D.C. route is on Class 4 tracks, which have a maximum speed of 79 mph, meaning that the fastest you’ll be going on a train is about the speed of an average driver on I-95. These tracks are leased from other companies, such as the state-owned North Carolina Railroad Company from Durham to Selma, N.C., and private CSX Transportation from Selma northward. Such companies don’t always have an incentive to devote additional funding to develop and maintain the tracks to increase their class, especially when they profit primarily from freight traffic.The other interesting twist to the Amtrak route to D.C. is that it dips south of Raleigh, taking a tortuous path through the North Carolinian towns of Selma, Wilson and Rocky Mount before bending northward toward Virginia. It seems rather absurd that the train goes out of its way to hit low-population centers instead of following I-85, though a recent project to redevelop part of the so-called “S-line,” which was dismantled in the late 1980s, would create a more direct connection from Raleigh to Richmond. The bottom line is that the current circuitous route adds a considerable amount of time for those coming from the Triangle.Anyway, enough with the details about railroads. I’ve learned that the more you talk about trains, the more people curiously nod and start asking whether you have special routines you feel compelled to follow or an intense fascination with specific topics, so we’ll skirt those questions for today.Despite the relative inefficiency of taking the train over driving, I opted for the Amtrak. When the day finally came and I boarded the train, many of the seats were already taken. As I approached the back of the train car, I saw that the only section remaining was marked “reserved for parties of three.” I turned to a couple random people and asked, “Would you like to be a party of three with me?”, and after they took out their headphones and mumbled unintelligibly, we took our seats, thereby forming an undying bond.As the train began its journey and we passed the bucolic scenery of North Carolina and Virginia outside, I flitted between doing schoolwork, reading a book and gazing wistfully out the window. I felt transported back in time while strolling down the ‘80s-like corridor of the train and to the cafe car, whose prices seemed immune to inflation. The conductor and staff marched around the train in their cute little hats, scanning tickets and telling people which exit to use for the next stop. The woman next to me kept talking to me about birria tacos and how she couldn’t wait to eat a bunch after she got off the train — she gave me recommendations of where to get the best birria tacos in D.C., and I nodded encouragingly since I didn’t have the heart to tell her I don’t eat meat. It was all so fanciful, so carefree.Seven hours later, I stepped out onto the platform at Union Station in Washington, D.C. We won’t talk about the rest of the trip, but I remember how fulfilling that journey felt even though driving would have been the more efficient option, cutting two hours off the trip and giving me more flexibility for when I could return. It’s no secret how obsessed society has become with efficiency, whether it’s cutting out unnecessary stops in travel or leaving behind once-cherished childhood hobbies to focus on more “adult” obligations. In medicine, my chosen profession, efficiency allows for treating more patients in a more organized way. A wistful surgeon who spends hours using a more complex method for the same operation would not stay gainfully employed for long, and an emergency department that couldn’t quickly triage emergent concerns from lower-priority issues wouldn’t be providing the best care.But while we often trumpet what’s gained with efficiency, we fail to consider what’s lost. Sometimes we have difficulty parsing the tasks requiring efficiency from those that offer opportunity for discovery, enjoyment and whimsy. A drive to D.C. would have bought me a couple of hours, but the train ride gave me the joy of relaxing as I observed the countryside, chatting with my fellow passengers and experiencing something new. Shorter appointments in doctors’ offices may decrease wait times but abbreviated conversations may erode the patient-physician relationship, requiring quick fixes due to the lack of time for more meaningful dialogue to address root causes.This isn’t to say that the Amtrak has to be slow to be enjoyable — it’s possible to create a faster route from Durham to D.C. that captures the same whimsy of my experience. Sometimes life is more about enjoyment than optimization, or vice versa, and the trick lies in finding the most opportune moments for each.Nathan Luzum is a third-year medical student and a member of the DSPC Board of Directors.

Why we need 'why',Gabrielle Mollin,2024-04-18T12:44:00Z,Apr,18,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/041824-mollin-passover-questions-learning-20240418.html,"One of my favorite things to handwrite is a question mark. I love the controlled squiggle of my pen coupled with the satisfaction of completing the curved symbol with a precise point, ink seeping deeply into the page. For me, the question mark is certainly the most gratifying form of punctuation. Yet my somewhat irrational appreciation for the question mark stems from my love for questioning as a whole, not just pleasant punctuation. Curiosity and questioning are central values of the Jewish faith, and especially to the upcoming holiday of Passover, often deemed the “holiday of questioning.” As Jews across the world sit down for the Passover seder (a ritual meal for the holiday), they are encouraged to persistently ask questions throughout. And traditionally, the youngest at the table asks the “four questions” about the holiday itself. To be Jewish — on Passover and all other nights — is to readily question everything. Consistent with Jewish culture, my parents and grandparents were insistent that my childhood be filled with curiosity and debate over dogma and conformity. I remember coming home from school days, eager to recount the highlights from my favorite history and science classes, only to have my mom question my questioning skills during the day. When I would leave for school each morning, typically rushing out the door, behind schedule with my breakfast in hand, my mom never failed to hastily remind me, “Ask good questions!” I’ve grown up persistently asking why. And I’ve come to value good questions over answers because they’ve taught me to explore and not just discover. My proudest moments in the classroom have not been the times I’ve been able to answer questions others can’t, but instead the times I’ve posed questions that bring people to stop and think. Solutions comfort; questions disrupt. And I like to disrupt.So as this is my last column of the semester, I’ve been reflecting on why I started this stint as an opinion writer. I’ve realized that paradoxically, my why is why. Life is pretty one-dimensional if you never stop and think about why. And being opinionated means never shying away from asking questions, even if they are disruptive. That’s what I’ve been taught to do my whole life, and that’s what I aimed to do this semester through questioning our partisan biases, the existence of safe spaces and the use of political buzzwords.But I know life to most people isn’t so much about asking questions but finding answers, especially here at Duke. Duke students are devoted to definitives: should they take that hard class outside of their major, what grades will they get and seriously, where will they intern this summer? And while many students express disdain for the status quo, most are pretty comfortable knowing they have their answers. Yet as tempting as it is to have all the answers, there is so much power in embracing the unknown. There is much to be said for the sheer freedom that we have as young, educated college students; how could we not use that freedom to question? We aren’t expected to have the answers at this age. And if we really are the changemakers of the future, as Duke likes to remind us, we need to be willing and ready to question everything. If we don’t question, we embrace the status quo and lose out on an opportunity to shape the future. Rather than passively embracing traditions and beliefs because of their history, we must seek to lead questioning on the world around us. We cannot be comfortable, blindly accepting the status quo, looking for answers and avoiding tough questions. And we cannot simply believe what we read, hear and learn as objective truth. So question, ask, probe, inquire, examine, investigate and so on. Wonder why and challenge what’s around you. Herd curiosity and questions, and mold them into action, helping create a better world for everyone by persistently inquiring “Why?”Gabrielle Mollin is a Trinity sophomore.

Why do people still not believe in climate change?,Nik Narain,2024-04-18T04:00:00Z,Apr,18,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/041824-narain-climate-change-disbelief-20240418.html,"A study from this February by the University of Michigan estimated that 15% of Americans don’t believe climate change is real. The researchers analyzed over 7.4 million tweets from roughly 1.3 million people, who geocoded the posts and classified the posts as “for” or “against” climate change using an AI large language model. Climate change denialism was most highly clustered in the central and Southern U.S. and was further correlated with political affiliation.At an institution with its own Office of Sustainability, Climate Commitment and an entire school dedicated to the study of the environment, I find that the idea of an active portion of the public denying such a seemingly obvious threat to our country feels at the very least farcical. With so much research supporting climate change, how is this issue still so polarized? The main issue in climate discourse is not the fact that the climate is changing, but the degree to which humans are at the root of this change. After all, the Earth’s average climate has fluctuated wildly over its long history, and humans have historically had little control over these changes. Climate change deniers view natural disasters as a natural occurrence whose increased frequency has no correlation to climate change, but instead has correlation to an increased availability of information about natural disasters. They report that climate statistics are wildly exaggerated and connect this sense of overblown rhetoric with a need for increased scrutiny of such claims. After all, it’s safe to say that methane, for example, is a load of bullsh*t (think about it). But more so than a distrust in the facts is a distrust in people. A study in Plos Climate reported that U.S. voters who don’t trust universities are also more likely to believe that human activity doesn’t cause climate change. The paper also referenced a 2016 poll in which 57% of conservative Republicans were found to believe that climate research findings were influenced by scientists keen to advance their careers over promoting truth. This broken relationship between the ivory tower and the much larger rest of the world furthers distrust in evidence-based research and all of science as a whole.The challenge with climate change is that it is not only a scientific finding but a personal responsibility. Climate change is not just a process, but a mindset (kind of like being premed), and with that comes a set of demanding psychological and lifestyle changes some people either don’t want to or can’t commit to. After all, climate anxiety is a very real thing, and the passion and prioritization of climate change has the potential to compromise our well-being to a point of disservice to ourselves and consequently the world around us. Getting more people on board with efforts towards climate justice or even just believing in climate change is extremely important. It is not only critical to the health and safety of our planet and the welfare of communities around the world, but also to our global economies. For example, according to the United Nations, many people don’t know that renewable energies like solar or wind power are actually cheaper than fossil fuels and generate three times as many jobs of comparable wages. At the end of the day, people are not going to care about issues that don’t impact them directly, and people are not going to trust information from sources that they find exclusionary or suspicious. Combating climate denialism starts with effective climate communication and especially climate storytelling because the majority of people engage with science through media and not academia (after all, that’s why you’re reading an Opinion article in a student newspaper over a journal article in PLOS Climate). It is clear with an ever-growing body of research that the hard “facts” of climate change are not changing — our global temperatures are rising, natural disasters are growing all the more prevalent, we are accelerating a sixth extinction, and plenty more unsettling truths about the state of our world. If scientists are reaching the same conclusions about the detriments of our consumption, what needs to change is the way we present this information, and how we choose to craft a narrative that leaves its audience hopeful rather than with a deep sense of impending doom. At least, I know that’s the kind of media I need, as I fear that my own deep dives into this subject has left me feeling something worse than fear: apathy. I’m sure many of you reading this can resonate with this.Several organizations are seeking to tell climate stories in original ways, like the Climate Stories Project, Yale Climate Connections and Grist online magazine. These outlets, among several others that would take pages to list, leverage the power of personal narrative and draw a human connection to the multitude of facts we’ve accumulated over just a few short decades of climate research. For the many students at Duke working towards a career in climate justice, I can only empathize with how challenging it is to focus your energy so deeply on an issue that many people still believe to be a “hoax” — or at least say that on X. If anything, I hope this piece affirms the work you’re already doing, and encourages you to share the stories of that progress.Nik Narain is a Trinity junior.

Your new curriculum: An invitation,Carol Apollonio,2024-04-17T04:00:00Z,Apr,17,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/041724-apollonio-new-curriculum-20240417.html,"We have a new curriculum! When it comes to the classes you have to take during your brief time in our clutches, I’m guessing that the views from the two sides of the podium have differed radically.On your side: a guide to achieving — or a series of obstacles standing in the way of — success, glory, wealth and happiness. Over here: an exciting array of intellectual opportunities — or a set of conditions to meet to fill our classrooms or clear them of weeds. Over its 24 years of life, the old Curriculum became cumbersome. Those weird little codes (“MOI”) became mere sound and fury, signifying nothing. Registration became an exercise in getting requirements out of the way and building credentials, on the one hand, and finding easy, low-demand classes on the other.Your advisor urged you to explore intellectually! Expand your mind! Try something new! You saw their lips moving but heard no sound.To judge from conversation shreds that I overhear on the quad, students spend an awful lot of time ranting about grades, their GPA, micro-points that have been unfairly deducted, the injustice of this or that professor’s grading standard, and the frenzied quest for A’s in everything. I hardly ever hear excited discussions of class content. The second dominant theme, intertwined with this one, is about the relationship between coursework and future careers. As the this-side-of-the-podium people have assumed, these twinned concerns have played an outside role in how students select their courses. I was in a salon off campus one time (yes, this does happen occasionally). The person making me over told me about a bunch of young ladies who had come in to get fixed up for some fancy campus event. One of them spent her entire haircut in a rage: “My dad didn’t spend all that money for me to come to Duke just for that professor to give me an F,” she ranted. We don’t seem to get too much of that kind of complaint relating to our Russian literature classes, but of course, how would I know? Every April, your professors suit up for those painful moments when students realize their grade might be hovering around an 89.4 or a 91.3 or a 72. They will be dropping in for a friendly visit, to let us know how much they love the subject and our class in particular, despite difficult circumstances. The most memorable cases of this kind are those where a student comes in with a 59.4. These, honestly, are some of my most interesting students, though I haven’t always seen much of them during the regular semester. Decades of experience tell me that they might have a very bright future. I had one advisee 10 years ago whose end-of-sophomore-year transcript was a thing of beauty: literally nothing but Cs in every class. Every single class, and not C+ or C-, no: 16 clean, round C’s. He had to have planned it, how could it have happened randomly? Great kid. A very fine mind. Loved Duke. The punch line is that he is making tons of money now in a career that he loves. Another kid, a humanities major with a string of Cs in my classes, came into my office with his eyes whirling around like pinwheels and asked me for a letter of recommendation. He giggled: “I just aced the LSAT. I guess I’m going to law school.” And he did.They are out there now in the world, doing great. Still cool and interesting and resilient. Where were we? Oh, the curriculum. Duke said, OK, enough, let’s start over. Could we make college a place where students expand their minds, spend time with the arts, ask big philosophical questions, and indulge in learning for the fun of it? Admittedly a wildly utopian project, aimed at overhauling an entire culture. Still, a brave, diverse faculty committee tackled the task. Toiling energetically over two action-packed years, they consulted students, colleagues and the community, and the result is your new Curriculum. Sparking universal joy, the Committee cleared out the “Modes of Inquiry” alphabet soup, refocusing on the basics — the different forms of knowledge that are our core. Nothing has changed in the majors; what we now have is a simpler, more assertive focus on the liberal arts. Including, let us be aware, the Arts and Humanities. The common enemy is the mindset that has viewed non-major courses as obstacles, or as opportunities to pad the GPA. The new curriculum challenges both students and faculty to rethink what we’re doing together. Yes, coursework does offer utility value, skills training for an unpredictable future. Your Certificates and Majors and Minors remain in place. But this moment offers an opportunity for all of us to reboot, to approach classes as a conversation, a feast of ways of thinking and being in the world. Shall we give it a try?Professor Carol Apollonio has been teaching Russian literature at Duke for 40 years, and this is her final semester.

Anything but a blueprint,Paul Dilly,2024-04-16T04:00:00Z,Apr,16,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/041624-dilly-anything-but-blueprint-20240416.html,"As a motivated student and human, I often established goals for myself — along with step-by-step plans of action for reaching them — whenever I found something new to strive for. I believed heightened focus and clarity would come as a result of my preemptive planning — which in turn would theoretically better equip me to conquer the work ahead. Foolproof, right? Wrong. I’ve found these supposed blueprints for success only serve to do the opposite, wrecking both my productivity and joy via the restrictions that are inevitably part of them. So I stopped following them. Here’s why.When I set a goal for myself, I set it hard — really hard. Like, planning-for-months hard. During the COVID shutdown (my sophomore year of high school), for example, I spent three months planning out how I was going to ace the SAT. I researched the different methods of studying, sifting through hundreds of blogs’ recommendations for the best textbooks, tutors and online prep services. Needless to say, it’s easy to look back and see my time would have been much better spent had I just picked a prep book and started working through it. (Hindsight’s a cruel thing.) My tendency to overplan and overcomplicate, combined with the principle of vicarious goal fulfillment, makes for a very pernicious combination — one that often grinds my progress toward my goals to a halt.Vicarious goal fulfillment, as coined in the 2009 study by Keith Wilcox and crew, is the tendency to view goal-setting as progress toward the goal itself, which subsequently causes the goal-setter to indulge in the very thing they vowed to improve upon in establishing their goal. In the context of this study, it was found that participants who made a resolution to eat healthier were more likely to indulge in comfort foods when presented with a healthy option: Their mere consideration of the healthy option when combing over their choices was enough to make them feel as if they’d made progress toward becoming healthier snackers, so more often than not they ended up choosing to reward themselves for such “progress” with a treat. Since outlining a plan can be a long and laborious process for me, I’m often exhausted before I’ve even started making progress toward the goal itself. That I expended so much energy in just the planning phase exacerbates the feelings inspired by vicarious goal fulfillment, my exhaustion further validating that false sense of achievement. This excuse is too much for my tired self to ignore, and I begin to think, “I worked hard to make it this far, and my effort shows I have what it takes to [insert goal here]. Since I know I can do it and I’m pretty tired, why not just stop here?” This was the case with my (prep for) SAT prep. After spending three months figuring out which study materials I wanted to buy, I didn’t study for the rest of the summer — not one hour. I wasted hundreds of hours worrying about how I was going to study, and when I finally sat down to start, I couldn’t. I was burned out before I’d even begun. Only when school started up again did I realize I’d made no progress toward my studying goal, which stressed me out and made me feel the need to catch up. These side-effects further hindered my ability to study. Which leads me to the next pitfall that comes with goal-setting: the overjustification effect. The overjustification effect occurs when extrinsic sources of motivation are introduced as an incentive to complete a task that is already intrinsically enjoyed, causing the external reward to wreck the innate desire to perform the task. This can then lead to decreased enjoyment and performance while engaging in that task. Some days, I’m randomly struck with an idea. Excited, I furiously scribble the thoughts flying through my head onto a napkin, hoping to catch each one before they flit away. Normally these ideas are coding projects I want to work on, inspired by an article I read or a topic recently covered in class. For instance, one of my project ideas was to create a recycling-near-me app (recycling isn’t a very accessible option in my hometown), which would allow the user to input their location and find directions to the recycling center closest to them. Having fleshed out the basics of what I wanted to do — the formatting of the UI, the languages to use, blah, blah, blah — I crafted one of my infamous over-the-top plans. I specified what I wanted to accomplish by when, as well as exactly how I’d go about it. Only to forget about it for a while due to a busy week of classes — and then come back to find I’m already behind schedule. Instead of being excited to start building the app, I was overwhelmed by all the tasks in front of me and stressed by the pressure of the deadlines I’d appointed. In seven days, I’d gone from being stoked to start coding to dreading even thinking about the requirements and restrictions I’d laid out for myself. This was not an isolated incident. It’s happened many times, in much the same way. And it always ends the same: I never complete the project. Because I let my lame, annoying plan get in the way. Because, rather than letting my passion carry me, I burdened myself with expectations. My intrinsic desire to work on the project was there — I wouldn’t have been so excited in the first place if it weren’t — yet I felt the need to incentivize myself further. I didn’t trust myself to get anywhere without a goal and plan to guide me. But these metrics I constructed became the enemy of achievement, supplanting my excitement with expectation. I was no longer doing it because I wanted to do it, because I’d enjoy working on and learning from it, but because I felt obligated to check off the next task on my to-do list in time. In this way, I corrupted each and every one of my passion projects and reduced them to a restless grind… and accomplished nothing but stress-induced headaches along the way.No good can result from establishing goals. At best, you reach the goal and stop there, capping your potential. There is not enough room in your mind for both intrinsic motivation and a goal. Though you create a goal out of an intrinsic desire to reach some milestone, it reframes your perspective in a way that ultimately poisons that desire. Whenever you work toward a goal, you’re now thinking about hitting some objective rather than enjoying the process, about completing rather than doing.In this way, goals become an antithesis to the passion that inspired them, a gradual erosion of your intrinsic motivation till only an itch to get the goal over with remains. So, upon completing the goal, this itch leaves you and, with it, any fire to keep going, to keep learning. But what if you let yourself explore your interests and desires freely, without a goal to get in the way? Then you would no longer be bound by the magnitude of the goal, but by the extent of your inspiration and will to immerse yourself in your vision. I took the SAT four times. The first three times, I told myself I had to get a certain score by a certain date by studying specific topics in a specific way. I failed to get my desired score every time. The fourth time I took the SAT was my last chance — it was the fall of my senior year — yet the pressure I felt while taking it was lower than it had ever been. Because I’d finally ditched the expectations. I stopped abiding by a years-old study plan and projecting my test-day performance using practice exams, instead dedicating myself wholly to studying. While taking the test, I thought not of the questions I had missed but of the practice I’d put in — and found confidence in that. And when I checked my score a few weeks later, I’d gotten what I’d been aiming for, and then some. All because I stopped caring about some arbitrary measurements and benchmarks and simply did what I needed to do.Worse still is the case in which you fail to reach your goal, too stifled by the requirements of the goal to which you’ve subjected yourself to achieve anything of substance. When I followed goals while working on side projects, I was effectively splintering my resources — time, energy, focus, willpower, you name it — between worrying about meeting the goal’s deadlines and actually getting stuff done, to the point where I didn’t have enough leftover bandwidth to do either. It’s no wonder I was unable to make progress toward my goal: Not only did coming up with the accompanying plan exhaust me (as with my SAT shenanigans), but so was sticking to the goal itself. If I’d cut the fluff of goal-setting and plan-following and fast-forwarded to the actual doing, I would have been able to learn and achieve so much — and likely more than the objective of any goal my imagination could’ve conjured at that.Goals suck. Plans suck. The blueprint sucks. You deserve better. So, now what? Goals and plans are equal parts intention and expectation. Living intentionally, purposefully, is a must for finding success (however you define it). But doing so without expectation is just as important. When you come to expect something of yourself, you inherently enjoy doing that thing less and, as a result, restrict your ability to go far in the direction of that expectation. It’s tough leaving the blueprint behind — it feels safe, comfortable. Defining the terms and conditions of your life in such concrete terms makes it seem as if you’re guaranteeing your success. Don’t fall for the trap. When formulating a goal, you can only envision what you are capable of accomplishing at that given moment. As such, your goal is bound to the skills and abilities you have right now, and blind to the knowledge and experience you’ll gain in the future. Thus, adhering to a goal prevents you from realizing anything beyond your past limitations. Rather, commit the same passion that led you to create a goal — or invest in a plan — to immersing yourself in something you currently have no idea how to do. In this way, you are consistently expanding upon everything you thought you were capable of — all without the added stress of an outdated standard you once enforced upon yourself. You have no idea what you are capable of. None of us do. Don’t try to quantify it. If you want something badly enough, you will find a way to make it happen. You don’t need goals; you need grit. And when you have that, you are infinite.Paul Dilly is a Trinity sophomore. His column typically runs on alternate Thursdays."
'Take a song with you on the journey',Luke A. Powery,2024-04-15T13:14:00Z,Apr,15,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/041524-powery-take-song-with-you-20240415.html,"In 2000, I received and accepted a job offer to become an associate pastor at the International Protestant Church of Zurich in Switzerland. However, due to delays in paperwork, it wasn’t until early 2001 that my wife and I could move overseas. At the airport, before we flew to a foreign land as newlyweds, my father — an ordained minister — wanted to pray with us. He prayed as we all held hands — my wife, me, my father and my mother. 23 years later, it wasn’t the prayer itself that stood out to me. It was what my father said to us after the prayer: “Take a song with you on the journey.”That phrase still reverberates in my soul. Yes, I grew up in a musical family. Yes, I was a music major as an undergraduate. Yet, the resonance of that statement goes deeper than those things: Song is food for my soul. W.E.B. Dubois presents this notion implicitly by using epigraphic musical refrains of the Spirituals at the beginning of each chapter in his 1906 book “The Soul of Black Folks.” In that book, he states that African peoples brought the “gift of story and song” to the Americas. My father also reminded us to bring that gift with us to a strange land.There is a certain kind of power in song that is not based on the quality of your singing voice but on the fact that you actually sing. As the poet Paul Dunbar put it, “I sing my song and all is well.” Even in the early church, they believed this as is implied in an old adage: “He who sings prays twice.” In their book “A Song to Sing, A Life to Live: Reflections on Music as Spiritual Practice,” Don Saliers and his daughter Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls band wrote, “Without songs to sing, life would be diminished.” To sing is to live and not to sing is to die.There is a striking example of this that I share in my sermons from time to time. During the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, there was a lot of crying, screaming, moaning and groaning on the streets, but there was also lots of singing. In one case, Ena Zizi, a 70-year-old woman, had been buried for a week in earthquake rubble that was at least three stories high. She was seriously dehydrated and had a broken leg and a dislocated hip, but that did not stop her. When they pulled her out of the rubble, she didn’t ask about the latest social media X wars. When they pulled her out of the rubble, she didn’t ask how many unread emails she had. When they pulled her out of the rubble, she didn’t ask whether her rescuer was Republican or Democrat. When they pulled her out of the rubble, Ena began to sing. Her body was worn and her throat was weary but life was singing. Her song amid the rubble was a melodic refusal to be stopped.So as we come to the end of this academic year, and as you look toward the summer and beyond, take a song with you on the journey. It is a gift for your soul.I leave you with the poem “The Gift to Sing” by the Harlem Renaissance genius James Weldon Johnson:“Sometimes the mist overhangs my path / And blackening clouds about me cling; / But, oh, I have a magic way / To turn the gloom to cheerful day — I softly sing.And if the way grows darker still, / Shadowed by Sorrow’s somber wing, / With glad defiance in my throat, / I pierce the darkness with a note, / And sing, and sing.I brood not over the broken past, / Nor dread whatever time may bring; / No nights are dark, no days are long, / While in my heart there swells a song, / And I can sing.”The Rev.

‘Bravo!’: Duke alums rave after watching Duke students do Duke student things,Monday Monday,2024-04-15T12:18:00Z,Apr,15,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/041524-monday-monday-duke-student-performance-20240415.html,"Everything was in place. The lawn was perfectly manicured and colored a perfect verdant hue. Metal forks had temporarily been restored to WU. Students were strategically placed all over campus to ensure that everywhere a visitor looked, someone was sure to appear academically engaged. A white picket fence had been erected outside the reunion tent to subconsciously remind the reunion attendees of their suburban homes.The show was about to begin. Continuing the annual tradition of soliciting alumni donations, this year’s performance of an “Average Day at Duke” was a smashing success. The alumni committee went above and beyond to organize a Centennial spectacle to remember.In anticipation of hundreds of alumni returning to campus to watch Duke students, the alumni committee scurried around campus handing out character sheets for students to play the role of various Duke community members. Coveted roles included “student looking contemplative in an armchair in Perkins” and “guy who high-fives the tour guide.”Alumni were escorted around the campus, ogling at the various students doing Typical Duke Student Things. “If you look to your right, you’ll see students engaged in a beloved traditional exertion of kinesthetic intelligence,” said one tour guide as he walked through Abele Quad, gesturing at four shirtless Pike brothers playing Spikeball. Throughout the journey around campus, tour guides explained to alumni that students were kept fed and happy with a constant diet of free t-shirts and Locopops, and that all mental health problems are resolved in a state-of-the-art Wellness Center with a Counseling and Psychological Services program that distributes stress balls and perfect solutions to all anxiety issues.“I’m so glad Duke administration has my best interest in mind,” one student loudly chatted to their friend on the Baldwin bench. “I love my university-provided friends through QuadEx!” As the tour guide passed the student, he slyly slipped the student a $5 Duke Dining gift card. In a brief moment that threatened to send the whole production crashing down, some unruly outlaws staged a demonstration on the lawn of the Chapel, demanding Duke to divest from fossil fuels and uphold the climate commitment. Thankfully, most alumni simply pulled out their phones to record the event, chuckling to themselves, “Some things never change!”Alumni looking to see something more exotic were given limited tours of the Lemur Center and the Duke Campus Farm. “What are they doing?” asked one alum, pointing with fascination at a student digging up a carrot.“It’s called manual labor,” the tour guide answered.The festivities were not just limited to West Campus. On East Campus, the tour guide invited graduates of the women’s college to relive their glory days by enjoying a dosage of 1950s-era lead poisoning in the gym or frolicking in the dead grass outside Marketplace. Alumni were then loaded onto armored shuttles to make the voyage to downtown Durham, where they could ogle at Durhamites safely within the protection of university-sponsored transportation, instead of taking the GoDurham Route 6 like adults. Asked about her thoughts on the tour, three-time legacy Sara Jeinfeld (T’86) answered, “I think it’s wonderful what Duke has done with the place. It just makes me want to donate a building!” Monday Monday just donated $5 million in exchange for a janitor’s closet in the new Lilly Library and a pasta sauce at Il Forno named after them."
The tyranny of time,Aaron Siegle,2024-04-12T04:00:00Z,Apr,12,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/041124-siegle-tyranny-of-time-20240412.html,"“I wanna go fast” is one of Will Ferrell’s most iconic lines in the NASCAR-themed comedy film ""Talladega Nights."" In the movie, the protagonist Ricky Bobby — played by Ferrell — basks in the glory of being a NASCAR folk hero before crashing and burning out of the sport after a string of poor performances. Ironically, the need for speed — the desire to go fast in all aspects of his life — is what slows Bobby down. Only when Bobby overcomes his fear of losing is when he returns to his former glory.Like Bobby, speed takes on its own intrinsic value in our lives. Especially at this point in the semester, time is always of the essence. But even when it’s not this time of the semester, time is still of the essence.Why?Well, after all, we only have until the end of this decade to avert the catastrophic 1.5-degrees-Celsius threshold of global warming. Furthermore, since life expectancy still hasn’t recovered to pre-pandemic levels, many of us are already 29% through our expected lifespans.While these exact thoughts may not be at the forefront of our minds, they contribute to a self-perpetuating cycle of haste. Rushing becomes so normal to us that we don’t even question it. But whether we realize it or not, in our quest for speed we have lost many of the skills that make us most productive. An intense focus on the present, understanding those around us and identifying the details that really matter are skills applicable to any task. But they are also skills at risk of extinction. Slowing down will open your eyes to the world of opportunities sitting in front of you.What are you doing while reading this article?There’s a pretty good chance that you are a) doing schoolwork, b) on social media or c) responding to messages. You’ve probably heard that multitasking is a myth, and yes, it’s true that ‘multitasking’ is really just rapidly switching between two different tasks. But what is lesser known about multitasking is how it impacts you and your ability to focus when not multitasking. Multitasking eats away at our concentration and creativity, activating parts of our brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand. Moreover, multitasking limits our capacity for self-evaluation. In other words, people may think that they are excellent multitaskers because their lack of awareness blinds them to the declining quality of their work.We aren’t the only casualties of our own impatience — those around us suffer too. Impatience causes us to fixate on the future, preventing us from experiencing the people and opportunities in our present. As students, we are unconsciously trained to be task oriented — consider the sense of satisfaction you feel when you check something off your to-do list. But to realize genuine change, the type of breakthroughs that help others, you need to be a problem-solver, not just a task manager. Great scientific discoveries aren’t realized by following a lab instruction manual or asking ChatGPT for the answer. Rather, they are products of lateral thinking, tinkering with the unconventional and perceiving the minutia that others glossed over. In effect, our desire to get things done hinders our ability to produce meaningful work.Every one of us wants to generate change, whether it be small change (like getting more sleep) or societal change (such as ending the use of fossil fuels). In the same vein, we often quote this line from activist Angela Davis, “I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept.” While noble, this mentality is often the source of activist burnout. We soon realize why the things that we cannot accept aren’t changing and are actually quite difficult to change. Change, even societal change, can happen but often over timescales that we are not willing to accept. Real change occurs over timescales that are beyond our attention span, so we substitute fighting for real change with creating the appearance that we are fighting for real change.Beginning in the mid-1960s, the Anti-Apartheid Movement initiated its campaign to convince institutions to divest from South Africa as a protest of discriminatory government policies towards black South Africans. Few major American institutions bought into the plan, until Michigan State University decided to divest in 1978. After pressure, a slew of other institutions (including Duke in 1986) divested their endowments as well — partially out of fear of falling behind their peer institutions. The capital flight out of South Africa caused by mass divestment has been cited as a major driver behind the end of apartheid, which began in 1990.To create the change they wanted to see, anti-apartheid activists had to work across the span of three decades. But in the end, momentum built to a point where apartheid ended sooner than many people thought. In the same way, though to a lesser degree, achieving your goal may be right around the corner — or a decade away. Living with this uncertainty is challenging but shouldn’t induce frustration. In fact, planning for the long term will help you accomplish more now. As Bill Gates put it, “Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.”Going fast doesn’t help you if you don’t know where your destination is. A destination isn’t a particular place or job (we’ll have plenty of time to figure those things out) but rather a set of values that are integral to your identity. Building a more sustainable world first requires building a more sustainable you. And that means engaging in the arduous task of saying no to the things that aren’t integral to your identity, your mission. Developing a systematic, long-term theory of change is the key to fulfilling goals, big or small.In this way we can outwit the tyranny of time — realizing our own power by letting go of our control.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity sophomore.

Buckle up: There’s more to learn,Anna Garziera,2024-04-10T04:00:00Z,Apr,10,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/041024-garziera-more-to-learn-20240410.html,"I was 19 years old when I learned how to pump my bike tires. I had been riding it flat for the last couple of weeks, and while I had a pump in my closet, I didn’t know how to use it. I was going to wait until the end of the semester, when I could have my dad help me pump it. Thankfully, a friend showed me how. It took all of 30 seconds per tire.When I thanked Henry, I was grateful for the next month of riding around campus. I later realized that he had gifted me something much more precious: a life skill.The summer is fast approaching, which means we students are starting to receive emails that advertise move-out services. These services offer college students a hand with packing, moving and/or storing their belongings until the start of next semester. These are not the first services to advertise on campus. Whether it’s spring cleaning or laundrymen, companies periodically offer to relieve college students of burdensome tasks.However, they might also be denying students a valuable learning opportunity. In an increasingly specialized world, it is too easy to rely on others for everyday tasks. We are forgetting that learning life skills is important too.I went to middle school in an English School for Girls, where home economics was among the required subjects — deemed as important as English and science. In home economics, we girls learned to cook in the first semester and to sew in the second. While gathering all the correct ingredients was as painful as every sting of a needle, I learned a lot in those classes. These life skills were seamlessly made part of the British school’s curriculum. Perhaps, there is something valuable in that.One reason why we are no longer requiring students to learn life skills is that globalization has made everything so cheap. Fixing a button on a collared shirt is no longer worth our time — replacing our items is cheaper than fixing them. Perhaps this explains the prevalence of disposable pencils as opposed to wooden pencils here at Duke. Who has the time to sharpen pencils anymore? (And who even owns a sharpener?)However, manual skills are not the only way our human capital is depreciating. We are losing our social skills, too. Technology has made it easier to communicate with others in all ways but face to face. Alongside that has come a steep increase in social anxiety among the young. The result? Less human interaction. Consider this: Some students get away with graduating college without ever having to talk to their classmates.The solution here is simple. Make developing social skills a requirement. To some extent, Duke is already doing this, by requiring all incoming freshmen to take a seminar. However, this is not enough: Other social skills should be developed too. Perhaps, we should encourage students to take classes in public speaking, interviewing or even negotiating. Imagine what well-rounded individuals we would see graduate.In a lot of ways, we are facilitating our own downfall. With an increased reliance on technology comes an accompanying loss of life skills — skills that everyone had just two generations ago. We rely on calculators to compute simple operations. We rely on ChatGTP for essay ideas. We rely on our Google Maps to take us home.Just before the end of the fall semester, my friend and I decided to walk to a Christmas Market that was about an hour away. The walk took us through downtown Durham and further out and further out until the suburbs started to look sketchy, and what’s worse, the sun started to go down. We found ourselves an hour away from home with only twenty minutes of light. My friend's first instinct was to call an Uber, which would have cost us $30 but at least would have gotten us home. We ended up walking to a bus stop, looking up the route, waiting, waiting and finally, after two buses, arrived home. That outing really made me think: If our phones had died, I don’t know how we could have made it home that night.That is just one example of how overreliance on technology can put one in a dangerous situation. If you were lost, you might know who to call — but do you know their phone number by heart?In the olden days, the average man could identify most local trees, maybe even a few local birds. He could build a decent shed and give a short history of his town. At some point, we stopped carrying with us that toolset of basic knowledge: instead, we ask Google all sorts of things. We no longer need to know the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit, how many ounces there are in a cup or how to tie a tie.In some ways, this is a great luxury. By freeing up that mental space, we can go on learning “more important things” like physics and philosophy. But at the same time, there is an associated cost. We are losing independence.College isn’t helpful, in that sense. The 21st-century college experience is very cushy. At least here at Duke, we don’t have to clean our own bathrooms, cook our own food or do our own laundry. We can choose to, but we can also choose not to. And we have to go out of our way to learn basic skills such as navigation, home repairs, first aid, budgeting. Maybe that’s one to say for the Navy — graduates at least come out knowing how to tie a decent knot.Some institutions have been pushing against this disillusionment of practical skills since their foundation. For instance, boy scouts earn their badges by learning how to do everything from fishing to woodcarving to painting. Others do so less directly. Here at Duke, there are classes on photography and personal finance.As a consequence, we don’t learn some essential life skills until our first jobs. Whether that is data entry or chopping onions, these skills will serve us well eventually. And for most of these skills, it’s okay if learning them takes time. We don’t always have to go out of our way to learn how to chop wood or unclog a kitchen sink.Yet, I wonder whether the younger generations would benefit if they were pushed more to learn these essential life skills. Everyone comes to college with different backgrounds. Perhaps, we should seize this opportunity to push for better learning outcomes, and for once, not academic learning. Perhaps, it would be preferable if everyone who graduated Duke were a decent swimmer and knew how to ride a bike.I was 19 years old when I learned how to hang a bear bag during my P-Wild freshman orientation. I don’t know whether or not I’ll ever have to hang a bear bag again, but I sleep well at night knowing that I have just one more skill up my sleeve.Anna Garziera is a Trinity first-year.

When you accidentally read an anti-transgender court document,Jess Jiang,2024-04-10T04:00:00Z,Apr,10,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/041024-jiang-anti-transgender-court-document-20240410.html,"Last May, more than 20 conservative states filed an amicus brief against the inclusion of gender-affirming care for transgender people under the North Carolina State Health Plan in the court case Kadel v. Folwell. The case is still open, so I'm more concerned about the brief's arguments than its outcomes.I didn’t mean to read a legal document — my idea of court cases is that they can be long, painful and expensive, which makes me want to avoid all things judicial — but an article I was reading linked to it. I was curious, and before I knew it I had read the whole thing and also gathered 38 pages’ worth of notes on articles, medical studies and legal documents on transgender care. I read the brief because I can think of many arguments in favor of providing gender-affirming care, all of which are based on the belief that people who experience gender dysphoria — defined as severe or persistent distress associated with incongruence between one’s gender identity and biological sex — should be able to access effective treatment if this harms no one else and doesn’t cost exorbitant amounts of money. Yet I was at a loss about why and how people would argue against gender-affirming care, except possibly due to religious beliefs or unfamiliarity with transgender issues.Is gender-affirming care medically necessary for transgender people? And secondly, is gender-affirming care medically necessary for transgender youth? The brief made three arguments in the negative, presented verbatim here:1. “Chemical and surgical interventions cannot be assessed separately from the conditions to be treated.”That is, the authors of the brief argue that procedures that are effective for one diagnosis (such as puberty blockers to treat precocious puberty) are inappropriate for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (such as puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria who’ve started puberty).The authors also uphold physiological normality as a good thing: For example, they draw a distinction between mastectomies used in breast cancer treatment and top surgery meant to decrease the psychological distress a transmasculine person feels about their chest. I agree that normal is absolutely the goal in some situations — for example, it’s a good thing to have the normal five-ish liters of blood in your body, not twice that or none that — but “normal” is not synonymous with “optimal” in all situations. For example, if everyone were forced to wear normal-sized clothing, only people who were normal-sized to begin with would be happy — some people would have clothes that simply don’t fit and are uncomfortable or pose health hazards. In the same way, transgender people, if forced to conform to their assigned sex at birth, can experience gender dysphoria.2. “Health authorities across the globe consider the gender transition interventions at issue here to be “experimental” and unproven.”I was confused by this statement. If it’s true that gender-affirming care is medically unsound, then why do major medical associations in the U.S. — such as the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics — all support care for transgender and gender-expansive youth? And why can I easily find studiesshowing that being able to access gender-affirming care if you have gender dysphoria earlier rather than later is beneficial? Transgender and nonbinary youth who can access puberty blockers and hormone therapy are significantly less likely to be depressed or suicidal: In transgender and nonbinary youth under the age of 18, the use of hormone therapy was associated with 39% lower odds of recent depression and 38% lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year compared to youth who wanted hormones but didn’t get them. In addition, the vast majority of people who transition are happy they did: Less than 1 to 2% of people 13 and older who underwent any gender-affirming surgery regretted it.The brief cites statements from the United Kingdom and several other European countries that have rolled back gender-affirming treatment for minors, which include puberty blockers and gender-affirming hormones, as evidence that such treatments are medically unsound. I won’t argue that, like many other medications, puberty blockers and hormones can have physiological side effects even as they increase psychological well-being. But the UK’s decision to only offer puberty blockers in clinical research settings, not routine care, has been criticized by its own patients, family and friends of patients, medical providers, and the general public. 72% of those consulted responded that not all of the relevant evidence has been taken into account in making this decision, with 3,492 of those consulted believing that puberty blockers are beneficial and should be made routinely available, compared to 180 who believed that blockers were harmful, unnecessary or unproven and should not be made routinely available to gender dysphoria youth.Similarly, the focus of the Swedish recommendations that the brief cites seems to be more on ensuring that youth who transition are indeed transgender. Children with gender dysphoria onset before puberty are eligible for hormonal interventions after extensive evaluation, and children with gender dysphoria onset in puberty will be able to explore other options before gender transition care — which doesn’t mean that gender-affirming care won’t be offered.This is where I think the authors’ wording is slightly misleading. Specifically, it seems to me that gender-affirming care isn’t experimental in the sense that we don’t know if it works for transgender people or not; gender-affirming care is experimental because we could better differentiate transgender kids (who are suffering from gender dysphoria) from cisgender kids (who are suffering, but not from gender dysphoria). That is to say, therapy and gender exploration before medical transition are important. And the authors of this paper would partly agree with me.3. “Unlike puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries, counseling care enjoys widespread support and has no physical side effects.”Although being able to transition medically improves the lives of transgender youth, it’s important that other conditions aren’t mistaken for gender dysphoria. People can indeed be mistaken about the source of their distress or their gender identity. For example, cisgender people may mistake trauma from sexual assault or bullying for gender dysphoria. Indeed, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) standards of care do acknowledge that psychological counseling is important: comprehensive assessment is recommended for all dysphoric youth before any medical interventions. When properly implemented, psychological counseling may last from a few months in cases where gender dysphoria is relatively clear-cut and enduring to several years if other mental health factors are present. I found it interesting that the authors misrepresent WPATH’s standards of care for transgender health to imply that the only gender-affirming care that should be offered is counseling care: “[A] method of treatment with no physical side effects has been recognized — even by prominent proponents of chemical and surgical intervention — as an effective clinical response to gender dysphoria.” If it were true that psychological counseling alone could resolve gender dysphoria in transgender people, that would be amazing. Unfortunately, while psychological counseling can be very helpful in understanding one’s gender identity and learning how to cope with dysphoria, it doesn’t seem to consistently and successfully resolve gender dysphoria on its own. At least, I could find nothing suggesting so with a Google search.In reality, WPATH’s standards of care state that counseling should be offered because not every transgender person needs hormone therapy or surgery to alleviate dysphoria. Sometimes social transition is enough, but the experience of being transgender varies so much that it truly depends on the individual. It’s not that gender-affirming care is expensive, either. California and Massachusetts found that the benefits of gender-affirming medical treatment outweigh the costs. Including transgender-specific care in insurance is actually cost-effective in comparison to not treating gender dysphoria.Instead of trying to help by making it harder for people with gender dysphoria to access gender-affirming care, I’d like to propose a somewhat controversial idea (by which I mean that I hope it isn’t controversial at all): What if we focused on decreasing discrimination against transgender people instead?I was taken aback when I learned that compared to cisgender adults, transgender adults have four times as many suicidal thoughts and six times more suicide attempts over a lifetime compared to the U.S. population. Part of the difference in statistics is probably explained by the gender dysphoria that some transgender people experience, but discrimination against transgender people certainly accounts for a good part of this difference. In a survey of U.S. transgender adults in 2015, 13% of respondents who were denied medical treatment because they were transgender attempted suicide in the past year, compared to 6% of respondents who weren’t denied; 11% of those rejected by family attempted suicide in the past year, compared to 5% who were accepted; and 9% who wanted gender-affirming care but were not able to access it attempted suicide in the past year, compared to 5% who did. Anti-transgender legislation in the U.S., which has rapidly increased in the past several years, seems very likely to harm transgender people instead of helping.To me, it’s less important that you agree with me and more important that you too believe in engaging in dialogue with the other side, viewing all people as equals and acknowledging that there’s a possibility, even if improbable, that you may be wrong. If so, aren’t we on the same side after all?Jess Jiang is a Trinity senior. Their column typically runs on alternate Wednesdays."
"Choose you, always",Paul Dilly,2024-04-09T04:00:00Z,Apr,9,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/040924-dilly-choose-yourself-always-20240409.html,"Pain defines you — how could it not? It is not you, but it led to you: It contributed to the chain of experiences that got you to this moment. Denying its existence — and its influence — only drives you deeper into its clutches. I know, because I tried to deny it too.When loved ones asked me how I was doing, I used to be honest: I’m hurting, I’m exhausted and I’m scared that I may always feel this way. And I was all too often met with supposed encouragement like “you’re fine” and “stay positive” or rote advice like “get out more.” It seemed they were brushing off my pain without bothering to try to understand what I was going through. I felt suffocated and isolated by my struggle, and all I wanted was empathy — so it killed me when I didn’t get it. Because then I felt doomed to suffer alone.As someone who’s wrestled with OCD since the fourth grade, my days are often filled with an invisible war with thoughts I can’t seem to control, let alone suppress. So loud and demanding are they that I feel I have to do their bidding to rid myself of them. If I don’t, they fill my head with unrelenting pressure to bend to their will — to the point where I cannot breathe. My mind seldom feels like my own, and it often uses its power over me to wreck things in which I once found joy. Reading became restless memorization, rereading each page 20 times until I could recite it backwards. Playing sports and running became an unhealthy health obsession, with my new efforts leading to severe anorexia (ironic). And now, school: my love for learning replaced by a pit of expectations, opportunity given way to obligation. I can’t remember what it was like to learn freely, to code up a fun project or write on the side without expecting the next big tech startup or an award-winning book to come of it. (Even as I’m writing this piece, I feel pressure to make it as good as my last one.) This was (is) my reality. I was fighting hard to make it through each day, and I couldn’t understand why others couldn’t acknowledge that. Searching for an explanation, I churned through the possibilities. Maybe they didn’t know what to say; maybe they also had a tough day and didn’t have the capacity to respond better; or maybe it pained them to see me in pain, so they preferred to pretend I was fine (for their own sake) instead. No matter how much I thought about it, though, I could not find the answer. Thinking it would spare me the interactions I’d come to dread, I decided to start feeding people what they wanted to hear. The next time someone asked how I was, I plastered a Cheshire Cat grin on my face and belted out an enthusiastic “I’m good!” But this act only deepened the wound.I thought such a lie was quick and shameless — how could five seconds of playing along hurt me? That’s where I was wrong: The pretending didn’t end. So long as I remained in the person’s company, I felt pressure to “live up to” the good life I’d said I had — leading me to fake laughs and good times to pass my own standard. Living these little lies necessitated a constant pretense — being alone was now my only chance to live in truth — which made the reality I came home to that much harder to deal with. Maybe I never had the support I wanted from others. But at least before I had myself. Now I was fleeing from the pain I’d once fought back against.I cared what others thought of me. Clearly. That’s why I so badly wanted to control their responses to my honesty. That’s why I ultimately let them control me, why I adapted my entire persona for their sake. But what about me? What if I cared what I thought, too? And that’s when the revelation struck: I had framed it all wrong. I had placed so much emphasis on other people because I was speaking for their sake. So instead I tried speaking for mine. I told the truth. Not because I no longer cared what they thought. Not because I wanted to be vulnerable with them. No. I do it because I never want to deny myself again. I do it because it’s a way for me to process and acknowledge the pain I’m facing. I do it because it’s what I need to do — for me.We face different struggles, and we process our pain in different ways. For me, I process by being brutally honest. Telling the truth enables me to live as I am: I can be at peace with how I feel and simultaneously strive to make things better for myself. The smiles and laughs are no longer forced; I let them flow freely. Maybe you’re a truth-teller too. Maybe not. Regardless, give yourself what you need to heal. I blamed others for my discontentment — do not make the same excuse. You are the only one who knows what you need; as such, you are the only one who can give it to yourself. Holding to that will suck sometimes — you may have to adjust your priorities, sacrifice other opportunities or leave behind some relationships — but it’s the only way through. Whenever someone hits me with one of those lame replies, I remind myself that I am worth it. I am worth telling the truth. I am worth fighting for. And so are you.

Pay attention in class,Heidi Smith,2024-04-08T04:00:00Z,Apr,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/040824-smith-pay-attention-class-20240408.html,"I’ve been swimming a lot recently — and, no, thankfully not in Brodie. This behavior has perplexed me, as it’s not because I enjoy swimming (I don’t) or that I’m particularly good at it (I’m not). But, as I mentally composed this piece while completing my decidedly mediocre laps, I realized my urge to go to the pool is not about the physical act of swimming — nor the five kudos I will receive on Strava after — but rather the necessary detachment from the less-than-waterproof world inherent to being in a pool.I used to go on walks to plan out pieces of writing in my head, but lately it’s hard to fully disconnect. I mean, I have to maintain my 100,000 minutes of annual Spotify listening somehow; plus, the pollen is atrocious this year. In our age of connectivity, arguing that it’s hard to concentrate is not an original thought. However, the spaces in which we are forced to fully be alone with our thoughts — or ours plus those of other people — are diminishing. Heck, even Taishoff, the pool in Wilson Gym, recently installed a giant screen so that now being alone with my thoughts includes wondering why “Learn to Swim” lessons are advertised to people already in the lap pool. Needless to say, if they ever invent waterproof earbuds for the pool — or even if they already have — please don’t tell me.I don’t like swimming, but I do like being present. Hence, being in the pool forces me to either entertain myself with my thoughts or face unending boredom — and I know what I’m picking. Yes, paying attention to my surroundings is something I — and honestly most of us — need to improve in general, but there’s one activity in which our attention seems to particularly wane: class.I previously wrote about the lack of attendance in Duke’s undergraduate courses. This surely remains an issue, but, while reflecting on my four years of education here, I noticed a trend in their staying power, almost so simple it’s stupid: The classes I got the most value from tended to be the ones in which I paid the most attention.I’d like to ascribe this to a moral failing, but that’s only part of the issue. Simply put, when professors ban or discourage laptops in class, I am forced to pay attention — which, despite it all, is what I would like to do — and thus I learn more. When computers are allowed — as someone who would never type notes, partially because it’s less effective and partially because I’m not a big note-taker in general — I’m basically choosing whether I want to listen to the lecture or if I want to do all the New York Times games, check my email, answer Ed questions and read book reviews. Suffice to say, these are activities better done on the toilet, between sets at the gym or while waiting for a meeting to start.Upon reflection, the only place where a laptop makes sense in the classroom is in a discussion-style work session in which you are either referencing assignment problems, directly coding or filling out a lab. Otherwise, the majority of students are just going to be putzing around — myself included. Having the directive to unplug can be freeing. For lectures and seminars, the goal should be engagement with the material, not to get a perfect solve of the Connections to send to your three friends who also do it — hopefully I can internalize that one in the next half month.Using iPads is a bit more nebulous, since I’d like to believe they are mostly used for actual note-taking or solving along with examples. But, then again, I have looked over in a CS lecture to see a classmate watching Instagram reels, so I digress. Regardless, tablets are largely contained in their distraction potential to the user. Laptops by nature allow anyone sitting behind you to view your activities — or at least know that you’re doing something. Often, I’m able to resist the urge to use my own electronics in class only to find that my peers are, and I am unable to prevent myself from getting distracted by looking over at what they are doing on their computer. Hell, in-class distraction via web surfing is so prevalent it caused someone to make a startup.The same arguments for going to class can apply to paying attention, most significantly, the amount of money we pay to be here, the disrespect to our instructors and the number of people who wish they could be here in our places. I have only two and a half weeks of class left — probably ever — and I find I’m a little disappointed in myself that my attitude about a particular course often determined how mentally present I was — and, by dint, how much value I got from it.I sincerely respect my professors who have either discouraged or outright banned electronics in class — it simply makes for a better experience. It’s embarrassing how tough it can be to get through a 75-minute period without the internet — I couldn’t even write this whole article without checking Instagram and watching several Netflix episodes — but when it is a communal agreement of mutual respect of each other’s time, there’s no internal struggle. You just have to follow the rules.I miss the days of elementary and high school where I could just turn in handwritten assignments and we’d only have the Chromebook cart in the room if we were doing Kahoot or working on a research report. I regret the disdain I placed on my school’s no phone policy. I love technology, but you know what they say about too much of a good thing. What I really want is permission to unplug and dial in when it isn’t necessary. That’s what swimming gives me, and, in almost every other situation, I’m going to have to develop abundantly more willpower if I want to make the most of my immediate present.If we want school to be about school again, effort must be made on both sides of the equation. Professors should limit, if not ban, laptops and potentially other electronics in class sessions when they aren’t immediately useful. Because let’s face it: Even in a CS class, you’re probably not coding along with the instructor. As students, we should strive to not abuse technology use and be honest with ourselves about our levels of active attention. Because if we are not here — at least most of the time — to learn things, then we’re really just swimming in circles.Heidi Smith is a Trinity senior. Her column typically runs on alternate Mondays."
Touchstone: On turning 20 and our scorn of growing older,Advikaa Anand,2024-04-04T04:00:00Z,Apr,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/040424-anand-growing-older-scorn-20240404.html,"In 21 days, I will be 20 years old. The notion intermittently fills me with dread and delirium, and then again with excitement and elation. It feels as though 18 and 19 only offer mere tastes of adulthood, fleeting flavors of what life on one’s own might look like and of what it means to become one’s own person, independent from their relationships with other people. But there is a gnawing permanence to 20 — as though once I enter its folds, I am permanently swept up by adulthood, with no more recourse to the proximity of my childhood as a refuge. I will soon be closer in age to thirty than three, and that is terrifying to me. It feels as though something, besides my childhood, is slipping away from me, like I’m ebbing away from a particularly fruitful phase of life and tumbling down a cliff of massive responsibilities. This age seems to have a unique weightiness, and though my friends claim that 20 doesn’t feel all that different from 19, I know that once I cross this famed threshold nothing will ever be the same again. But is that such a bad thing?We seem to reside in a youth-obsessed society. This fascination with the uninhibited joys of being young transcends place and time to leave its mark across vastly different cultures. Movies, books and poems in every language illustrate the magical once-in-a-lifetime experience that is being young, featuring the riveting highs of discovering one’s self, exploring the world and claiming the liberty to make mistakes along the way. When we are young, we are free, and the further we inch away from our youth, the more steeped we become in responsibilities to people other than ourselves — to parents, siblings, friends, bosses, partners and children. And so we fear ever diving into the dreaded phase that lies on the other side of childhood: adulthood. And this is dangerous.The American obsession with youthfulness stretches back to the 1960s when post-war born baby boomers entered adolescence and young adulthood. To align with this new consumer base, industries and prominent brands began to employ “media and marketing tools that promoted the value of youthfulness.” Such messaging has important effects on consumers: “Messages about youth and age can certainly affect personhood and self-image depending on how an individual places value on the media, the culture of their environment.” As a result, those who have crossed a certain age threshold began to question their self-worth and value, seeing youth as synonymous with entities that are intrinsically “good” and old age as synonymous with entities that are intrinsically “bad.” Such perceptions are littered throughout media portrayals as well. For example, “Disney often portrayed elderly female characters as crazy grandmothers, hideous witches and evil mothers.” These characters “were juxtaposed with young female characters, often princesses, who represented beauty, kindness, happiness, and desirability.”It is this predominant cultural messaging that conveys youth as the only time worth its while in life. I enjoy listening to Bollywood music, and while Bollywood songs can be incredibly profound, weaving metaphors about withering trees and blooming wildflowers, I’ve also noticed how they dwell excessively on the merits of youth over the pitfalls of middle and old age. One romantic comedy that my dad, sister and I enjoyed watching together features a song with the following translation: “We have four days of youth to live / And the rest of our days are useless.”That seems like an incredibly sad way to live one’s life — assuming that you are constrained to a small window of time to live out your dreams, whatever they may entail; and that as you breathe more, each subsequent breath diminishes in its value. Certainly, the law of diminishing marginal returns cannot apply to living.Life, at least as I have seen it, is a beautiful thing. Turbulent at times, certainly, and also rife with disconcerting unpredictability. Poets spend their careers attempting to explain it. Artists spend their careers attempting to recreate it. And doctors spend their careers attempting to save it. Science has leapt to unimaginable bounds in its attempt to preserve life: we can now access defibrillators within the comfort of our own homes and artificial-intelligence-enabled robots that are capable of performing surgery. Yet, when we are endowed with the privilege of more life, we run away from it. We conceal its markers on our skin with pounds of makeup, those lines by our mouths that speak of moments that we have laughed from the pits of our stomach and those burrows that tell of times when we have sobbed tears from the hidden hollows of our souls. How haunting is it that we seek remedies for aging when in fact to grow older is an emblem of the same life that we yearn so endlessly to preserve?I don’t know what turning 20 will mean for me. And truthfully, I am terrified. I recognize that I am entering a decade fraught with consecutive milestones: graduating college, building my career, carving out my identity and forming new relationships. I do mourn for the childhood I leave behind: for the innocence of girlhood that I will never know again, of days when I dreamed of Prince Charmings and white horses who never came. I know that to become the woman I am meant to be, I will have to bid adieu to the girl in me. I know that as I take on more responsibilities, even those as mundane as filing my own taxes (ew), I am donning layers of experience that will transform me from the girl I have known myself to be.But this goodbye is a wonderful thing because I get to grow older. I get to make mistakes, I get to have my heart broken, and I get to live through countless nights wondering when day will break.20 is a touchstone that marks the rest of my life. The road ahead is not easy; it is fraught with unforeseen obstacles and the certainty of failure.I get to tread it. And I am so lucky. Advikaa Anand is a Trinity sophomore.

Why nutrition studies keep contradicting each other,Nik Narain,2024-04-04T04:00:00Z,Apr,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/04042024-narain-contradicting-nutrition-studies-20240404.html,"""Eggs are good for you,"" and ""eggs are bad for you."" ""Wine is good for you,"" and ""wine is bad for you."" ""Coffee is a superfood"" but also ""damaging to your health."" ""You should never eat saturated fat,"" but ""it’s really not that bad according to science.""It seems that nutritional studies are constantly contradicting one another. One moment we hear that a certain type of food is good then bad, healthy then unhealthy. This trend has occurred both with foods and entire food groups — like the low-fat craze in America in the 80s, in which few faulty studies from the 40s correlating low-fat diets with lower heart disease risk morphed into a dietary ideology promoted by health media, food industries and the American government. However, this drastic reduction in fat consumption actually resulted in higher cases of diabetes — not to mention all the nutritional deficiencies that come from not eating an entire food group!Accurate nutritional information is imperative for influencing our nation’s food policies, marketing and education. After all, nutrition science is the reason many of us were forced to change our notion of a healthy diet from a pyramid to a plate (because how did the government not know that nobody eats on a pyramid?!). So this rampant contradiction is concerning and frustrating to people who are looking to better care for themselves through food.One of the reasons for nutritional uncertainty stems from the flaws in nutritional study design. For starters, nutrition studies are often not well-funded, so low sample sizes can lead to results that aren’t generalizable to a wider public. Most studies that track dietary behaviors rely on self-reporting; for example, one would have to report everything they ate in a day with the exact quantity and exact time they ate it. The issue is that most people don’t remember what they eat long-term (I don’t even remember what I had this morning), and it’s impractical to measure out all your meals with scientific precision. Additionally, in the gold standard of dietary research — the randomized control trial — you would separate your sample into different dietary regimes for long periods of time. However, people are notoriously bad at sticking to diets (which is why 95% of diets fail). Finally, nutritional studies are never conducted in a vacuum (if so, that would be pretty uncomfortable for the participants), and these cannot control for major confounding variables for dietary behavior such as activity level, access to food, religion and income.However, a more sinister issue comes from nutritional reporting and publication bias. Most people get their science from media as opposed to academia, so journalistic headlines must rely on bold rhetoric to capture viewers’ attention. This often means that these headlines are polarizing, often at the expense of factual reporting. After all, a headline like, ""Coconut oil contains several nutrients, but can also cause adverse effects in high consumption,"" is a lot less interesting than, ""Coconut oil has never been healthy"" (to which my entire South Indian family collectively punches a wall). I think at the core of this issue is the idea that food needs to be moralized, that we need to have a definitive stance on whether a food is ""good"" or ""bad,"" if we should eat or should never eat it. But what if food didn’t have such a moral value, and instead was just … you know, food? What if every food has pros and cons and ""healthy"" looks different for everybody and everybody? What if an apple, for example, can be viewed with the same moral value as chocolate cake, bacon or soup, and the foods you consume have no connection to your moral value as a person? This neutral philosophy towards food is a fundamental tenet to intuitive eating and eating disorder care, yet seems radical in contrast with our modern viewing of food as a dogmatic ideology. For the millions of people who struggle with disordered eating and eating disorders, it’s no wonder that it’s so difficult to un-internalize the guilt-focused mentality that underlies behaviors like restriction and binge eating, because that moralizing rhetoric is all around us — on magazine covers, at dinner table conversations, even on the names of bakeries like ""Sinful Sweets"" … because the Devil is watching you eat that chocolate-covered strawberry. Moreover, with the increasing impacts of climate change and the wide availability of information on forced labor and animal welfare, it definitely isn’t fair to view food with neutrality to the point of complete detachment. Eating is never done in a vacuum — again, that would be really claustrophobic! Many of our food choices likely have some form of unintended harm just given the nature of our nation’s food system, and that is an unsettling reality to process. Our food choices do have political power, but our political situations do inevitably impact our food choices — especially as college students relying on Monopoly money (otherwise known as food points) to get through the day. How do we eat in a way that aligns with our values against a constant moral battleground around food? How do we determine what is actually ""good for us"" and the world around us against a system of scientific information ripe with contradiction? What will have to happen to the foundations of nutritional science and nutritional journalism, or the very definitions of ""healthy"" and ""unhealthy"" itself?Just as figuring out what you like to eat is an ongoing process, so is nutritional science, and we’re not always going to get it right. For now, when consuming nutrition-related media, it’s important to not hold every finding as a fixed truth, but rather one observation for a certain group of people, an observation that should be taken with a grain of salt (kind of like French fries).Nik Narain is a Trinity junior.

College wasn’t working for us. So we left.,Aaron Price,2024-04-03T17:09:00Z,Apr,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/040324-price-gap-semester-20240403.html,"Are you feeling burnt out from your classes? Floating through college? Have an opportunity outside of Duke you can’t pass up? A gap might be right for you. Gap semesters or years, where you take time off from your studies to focus on other things, aren’t just something you can take before you start college, but a valuable opportunity for any stage of your journey in higher education.I took a gap semester. It was life changing for me and many others at Duke. Here are our stories and why I think you should consider taking one too.I went to a high school where I woke up every morning excited to go to class. Some nights, I couldn’t fall asleep; I was too eager for the next day of school. Weird, right? My high school was project-based and I designed my own curriculum from 9th to 12th grade based on my interests and curiosities. It was a blast. Then I went to college — that’s what you do when you come from an upper-middle class home. I came to Duke because I was excited about the brilliant and ambitious peers, love college sports, basking in gardens and hate the cold of the northeast. College was entirely different from what I expected. My assignments were laborious and boring. I spent hours in Perkins completing problem sets that I deemed silly. I wasn't getting to enjoy the friends, sports or weather that I came for. I remember taking a social innovation course in addition to my electrical and computer engineering courses my freshman fall. We read a chapter from a book in the class that I thought was fascinating. I wanted to read the rest of the book. I ordered it. It arrived but I never made it past the first page. I was too busy and tired. Duke is such a special place, but it wasn’t working for me. So, I left. I joined an early stage climate-tech startup in San Francisco as their chief of staff and lived in a co-op centered on deliberateness and spirituality with 15 other people. I worked a ton and learned so much. I was leading seven-figure deals, writing code for production and implementing projects serving thousands of users. I got to talk to experts in carbon capture, my climate heroes and entrepreneurs trying to change the world. I learned more and grew more in these months than at any other point in my life. At the end of the semester, the company gave me a generous offer to forgo returning to college and stay in San Francisco. I turned it down.I wanted to go back to college. During my time away, I realized what I missed — the people, the walkability and the tenting for basketball games. In San Francisco, my adult friends had adult problems. At Duke, my biggest issue was if Skillet put meat in my vegetarian omelet. I realized that college is a sandbox and that I wanted to play a little longer.Now, armed with this clear intent for being at school, I returned in the spring of 2023 and loved it. I had my best semester ever at Duke. It was a blast and it was all thanks to my time off. Taking a gap semester gave me three main superpowers when I came back to school. First, it gave me a clear purpose for going to college that I was able to lean on to guide my decision making. This made it easy to switch my electrical and computer engineering degree to computer science and drop the clubs that didn’t align with my recreational goals. Second, it provided me invaluable real-world experiences that I could reference in my classes. That spring semester, I took a marketing course. I was able to leverage my experience pitching and spreading awareness for my startup in our course discussions. The professor loved it and I had many special opportunities arise as a result. Finally, taking time off from school showed me that I can be a valuable contributor to the workforce even without a college degree. It took away the stress for me of finding a job or caring about getting straight A’s in my classes. The worry about getting a job totally dissipated and I moved through college freely.This experience isn’t just unique to me. Students take gap semesters during college to work on all sorts of different things and every person I’ve talked to has grown immensely through and loved their experience.One of those students is Emily Cole. Emily took a gap semester during Covid to create a culturally relevant computer science curriculum for elementary schools and write her book, “The Player’s Plate” which redefines health for athletes.She told me, “It was a semester of extreme growth and reflection … This semester break from school was invaluable to helping ground me and realize what is truly important in life. The time away, and this opportunity to pursue writing my own book, gave me the confidence in myself and assurance in my values to return to Duke a better student, athlete and human.”Adam Yook also took a gap semester. He spent his time building engineering passion projects. He shared, “Throughout my time off, I was able to uncover shortcomings and discover new areas of discovery that previously were unknown to me. Coming back to classes in the spring, I was able to connect some of the more abstract topics covered in the course material to the projects I had worked on to better understand their relevance and applications. This connection allowed me to better engage with my classwork as I found it more engaging.”Further, he said that once he returned to school, “I better appreciated the elements of university that facilitate social connections with peers like clubs or just running into people at WU. Almost equally as important, I was able to slow down and just process the various aspects of my life that I really just didn't have the time for in the constant rush of Duke.”I’d be remiss to write this article without including Duke senior and gap semester advocate, Allison Chen. She left Duke for a semester to attend pastry school in France. She said, “Taking a gap semester forced me to explore both my personal and professional interests without the influence of other people. At school, I often feel guilty that I’m not following the traditional path, but I’ve discovered there are so many possibilities outside of school that we don’t know of or don’t talk about. Not only do I feel more confident in my own work and my own path, but I also got to bake pastries for eight months straight, and there’s no other time in my life I think I would be able to pursue that and eat that many pastries at once.”I’ll be the first to vouch that Allison’s eight months paid off; her mochi are the best I’ve ever had.So, consider a gap semester. Write a book, build a self balancing bike, make fancy pastries whose names I can’t pronounce or work on a startup. Do something that excites you. If you’re not having fun at Duke, you should leave. Take a semester off and do something you’ll enjoy. I bet you’ll want to come back after because you’ll realize there’s more sandcastles to be built on campus. And now, you’ll be ready to play in the sand.Aaron Price is a Trinity senior. His column typically runs on alternate Tuesdays."
A love letter to the Duke Chapel,Anna Sorensen,2024-04-02T04:00:00Z,Apr,2,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/040224-sorensen-duke-chapel-love-letter-20240402.html,"Easter is hands down my favorite day of the year. Growing up, Easter meant waking up at 7 a.m. for an egg hunt before heading to church for back-to-back services where my siblings and I got to sing the most glorious pieces of choir music, accompanied by a brass timpani and an organ which literally pulled out all the stops. Easter is — at its core — a celebration of joy and grace, and a powerful reminder that we are loved. So, being away from home for Easter as a first-year last year was difficult. It was the first time I hadn’t celebrated with my family and home congregation in over 10 years, and I felt lonely and disconnected. But a year has passed since then, and Easter has rolled around once again. I’ve spent this past year growing more attached to the Chapel, and I have slowly made it my own place of worship. From hours of choir rehearsal to random moments of prayer, the Chapel has been a constant in my day-to-day college life. This Easter, as the resurrection hymns I know by heart rose within the Chapel walls, I felt as though I was truly part of the congregation. The Chapel carries different meanings for different people at Duke. For some, it’s a central, enduring trademark of our university. Indeed, few buildings on campus are as recognizable and striking as this magnificent piece of architecture. It’s also a beautiful photo-op, especially this time of year as the life surrounding it blooms in full force. But for many others — myself included — the Chapel is a home for faith and spirituality. The Chapel is a physical reminder of the comforting and persisting presence of God and of a community grounded in hope and love amidst a busy college life. Being a religious student in college comes with its difficulties. For those who come from particularly expressive religious backgrounds, it can be challenging to find time to worship at school. Between navigating living on our own, taking college-level classes, and trying to make friends along the way, there’s enough on our plates to manage. If you practice your faith more privately, you may struggle to feel connected to God and a religious community when you find yourself in an entirely new environment, separated from the ties to faith you find at home. There’s also the challenge of navigating your religious identity in college. In an elite academic setting like Duke, there can be biases against spirituality and religious belief. We tend to define intellectuality within the bounds of reason, emphasizing the explicable over the miraculous. We find it difficult to believe in what we can’t see or label, and we struggle to surrender control and place faith in higher powers. More concretely, sentiment against organized religion is certainly present on college campuses. I will be the first to admit that there is valid reason to be frustrated with organized religion today. In a political landscape where religion is often wielded as a weapon of division by a select few in power, it’s easy to lose sight of how much good religious belief brings to the world. The Duke Chapel’s mission of ""bridging faith and learning"" seems especially apt to address these issues, which is an initiative I am particularly grateful for. Despite the challenges of living by faith in college, studies show that college students crave spirituality and spaces to explore their beliefs. During the complicated transition to young adulthood, religion can be a source of comfort and foster mental well-being. I, for one, leaned heavily into my faith during the first few months here at Duke. Duke Evensong Choir was the very first activity I picked up, and it remains the most valuable use of my extracurricular time to this day. Every time I enter the Chapel, I feel like some part of me is coming home, and I know I belong to something much greater than myself and my struggles or stresses. The Duke Chapel is doing some amazing work to create spaces where students can explore their spiritual identities. Anyone can learn about these resources by dropping in for a visit or by perusing the Chapel’s website. Check out the podcast Sounds of Faith to learn more about how Rabbi Elana Friedman, Rev. Kathryn Lester-Bacon and Brother Joshua Salaam support students on their spiritual journeys through college life. Get involved with volunteer work in Durham, which aims to ""build and deepen relationships in the community [and work at] the intersections of faith and justice to bridge the differences that divide humanity.""Above all, I would urge all Duke students to keep an open mind as you encounter people from diverse walks of life and faith and to challenge yourself to appreciate the power of inexplicable forces. Every college student should educate themselves on what it actually means to practice religion in today’s world — with all its nuances and dimensions. It is too powerful an influence to be neglected or dismissed by intelligent students preparing to engage empathetically with the people around them.An accessible and robust home of worship was not something I consciously factored into my college decision when I was applying to Duke. But the rewards I’ve found in both the recluse and the community at the Chapel affirm that I should have considered it. So, I genuinely thank God every day that I ended up here because of all the blessings I’ve found in friends, professors, and this beautiful campus, and because of all the ways my faith continues to mature at Duke.

Duke recommits itself to fossil fuels and an unlivable future for its students in recent ACIR report,Duke Climate Coalition,2024-04-02T04:00:00Z,Apr,2,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/040224-duke-climate-coalition-acir-report-response-20240402.html,"As of today, 234 other universities across the world have committed to divesting their endowments from fossil fuels, meaning that they no longer invest any portion of their endowments in the stocks, bonds, or funds of oil, coal and gas companies. In a recent report by the Duke Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility (ACIR), Duke has recommitted itself to the opposite, deciding once again that profits and loyalty to its fossil fuel shareholders come first, before the precious Climate Commitment and before the future of our world. As President Price said in a recent interview, ""It is presently not practical for DUMAC to account for carbon emissions in its portfolio.""That sentence should enrage you. The Duke administration does not believe that it is practical to make sure that we have a livable future. The production plans of every major fossil fuel company have us on track to achieve at least 2.4 degrees Celsius of warming — a temperature at which we will face the ""potential collapse of natural and socioeconomic systems,"" per a 2023 report. But sure, it is not practical to stop supporting those companies. Not to mention, fossil-free investing is actually more practical for ensuring the endowment remains stable in the face of climate risk (see pages 14 and 15 of our recent report). (As a side note, we would also argue that it is not practical for Duke to still label itself as carbon neutral if it’s not going to include its investment portfolio’s emissions, but that is beside the point.)The ACIR’s report is in response to two 2022 reports by Duke Climate Coalition (DCC) asking for divestment and endowment transparency. DCC followed up in 2023 with an extensive literature review on the efficacy of divestment in reducing the emissions of fossil fuel firms. In this OP-Ed, we explain the ACIR’s response to these three submissions. The first thing to note is its title: ""Response to 2022 DIVESTMENT PROPOSAL and Literature Review on the Pros & Cons of Fossil Fuel Divestment,"" with the date of the report’s release (Feb. 16, 2024) underneath. That is to say, DCC submitted a proposal for divestment in early December of 2022. The ACIR voted and released their response in February of 2024 — over 14 months later. One of the main pitfalls of college activism is simply the fact that students are only here for four years. The administration is well aware of that. They took nearly a third of our time at Duke to respond to our proposal. We are meant to think our voice is heard, but this proves the opposite is true. Waiting over a year for a response to a 10-page proposal is unacceptable and undemocratic.Looking at the actual content of the ACIR’s report only further shows the ways in which information is distorted to delegitimize the effects of divestment in fighting climate change. They first discuss whether divestment affects stock prices, beginning by citing a blog post by an NYU Stern professor. It is laughable for a world-renowned research institution like Duke to base its divestment report on an anti-ESG activist’s blog. In a meeting between members of DCC and ACIR, we were informed that anything we wrote in our 2023 literature review that cited a non-peer-reviewed source was not taken into consideration. Such sources included a 2013 report by three Oxford professors and a 2021 report by five major environmental groups on how much money major banks are giving to fossil fuel companies, as well as news articles from reputable media outlets. We used these sources because they have information that is simply not found in peer-reviewed literature: Scientific journals are not the watchdogs of the fossil fuel industry in the same way that NGOs are. Still, the ACIR chose to ignore anything we argued that used these non-peer-reviewed sources, which seems like an understandable decision at first glance. However, the ACIR report twice cites a non-peer-reviewed blog post by an NYU Stern professor, which even he admits are his ""not-so-profound thoughts"" about impact investing. Even The Chronicle misrepresented this article, calling it a study when, again, it is just ""musings on markets."" Moreover, ACIR uses a variety of other non-peer-reviewed sources, including a working paper that has since been revisedand articles in magazines like The Economist and The Harvard Business Review. To be clear, the content of these sources is interesting. However, using them while simultaneously disregarding the arguably more legitimate sources that we provided in our literature review is an unfair double standard that reflects the administration’s lack of respect for student research and advocacy.The report’s further discussions of the effects of divestment on share prices offer no conclusion and fail to acknowledge several sources that DCC provided in its literature review. They distort quotes from sources to imply greater ambiguity around the effects of divestment. For instance, the report cites Braungardt et al. (2019) as saying that they ""do not claim to offer a definite answer [on the effectiveness of divestment],"" notably omitting the second part of that sentence that explains that it’s because they ""intended to maintain as much objectivity as possible, which means weighing up the arguments is virtually impossible."" Indeed, if you continue to read that article, you will also see the authors explicitly conclude that ""divestment as an institutional strategy can contribute to increasing support for a climate agreement and effective climate policies in the medium and long term.""When discussing the effects of divestment on share prices, the ACIR also notably omits a comprehensive study by Cojoianu et al. (2021) on divestment commitments in 33 countries that found that increased divestment pledges were significantly linked to a decreased flow of capital into oil and gas companies. Rather, they discuss how a study of just four countries suggests that divestment is not effective. They do later discuss the Cojoianu et al. study but only that the authors suggest that federally-mandated divestment commitments can force domestic banks to invest in fossil fuels more abroad. That may be the case, but it is unclear why the effects of federal mandates on divestment would be relevant to the policies of Duke, which is not a federal government and whose divestment policies would thus not have that same effect. Again, it is a blatant warping of the facts to only include information that questions the legitimacy of divestment while ignoring any data that supports it.Later discussions of the effects of divestment on fossil fuel companies’ emissions again cite arguments made in the blog post, including data showing that private equity firms have invested over $1.1 trillion in fossil fuels. This blog author and the ACIR both use this as an argument against divestment, but we would argue the opposite. The same phenomenon originally occurred for coal until divestment from coal became the norm even for large banks; we need the same thing to happen with oil and gas. That will only happen when divestment is normalized, when private institutions across the board commit to a fossil-free future, when fossil fuel companies are seen as unequivocally evil and any private equity firms investing in them are betting against the odds and against our futures. A wide-scale movement out of oil and gas is not some pipe dream. Divestment from coal was normalized, so much so that coal facilities have been retired earlier or have been made to emit less, as a recent study from the University of Pennsylvania shows. Of course, the ACIR calls this peer-reviewed research into question, saying that, because coal is more carbon-intensive than natural gas, divestment from coal does not apply to divestment from natural gas. If that logic doesn’t make sense to you, join the club (maybe even join DCC). The ACIR made its conclusions despite the authors of the study explicitly noting that, ""Our results should bear external validity to the oil and gas industry, the largest source of carbon emissions, as it is similarly capital intensive and dependent on bank-intermediated financing.""The ACIR also argues against the evidence provided by this University of Pennsylvania study because, in their eyes, the starvation of capital will only work if polluting firms are ""locked into business strategies that compelled them to continue to be environmentally unfriendly."" They talk about how shipping companies provided with more funds became greener. That may be the case for shipping companies. However, fossil fuel companies are fossil fuel companies. They are ""locked into business strategies"" that ""compel"" them to be environmentally unfriendly because their entire business models are based on our continued consumption of fossil fuels. There is little incentive for them to seriously pursue alternative energy sources. Doing so would mean facing a market that is more competitive and has more participants in comparison to that of fossil fuels, where current big players have a profitable monopoly that allows them to gouge prices and construct favorable regulations however they wish.The fact that every fossil fuel company has either reduced their environmental commitments, cut their renewable energy plans or canceled their biofuels departments demonstrates their lock-in to a fossil-fuel-centric business strategy. Just in the past year, BP scaled back its emissions reduction goals for 2030 from 35% to 20-30%, Shell decided to not increase its renewable energy investments for 2023, and Exxon’s CEO announced his plan to double their oil production in the next five years. It’s ignorant to say that fossil fuel companies’ business strategies are not inherently unsustainable when their business models continue to revolve around fossil fuels and there is no market incentive for them to change. Duke has no concrete commitments to make its endowment more sustainable. Other institutions that have not divested are still leaps and bounds ahead of Duke in terms of the sustainability of their portfolio. Montreal-based Caisse, a pension fund with over $390 billion in assets, has committed to reducing its portfolio’s carbon intensity by 60% by 2035. Arizona State University Foundation has committed to achieving a net zero endowment by 2035. Even if Duke refuses divestment, some clear objectives that outline how the university will improve the sustainability of its $13 billion endowment would be better than the whopping zero commitments that we have today. And such commitments should not rely on shareholder advocacy, regardless of what Duke would have you believe. Not only is it impossible given the structure of how Duke’s endowment is managed, but putting faith in fossil fuel companies is like trusting an arsonist to put out a fire, as Oil Change International campaign manager David Tong put it. As DCC, we call on Duke to improve its endowment transparency, divest from fossil fuels and other destructive industries, reinvest in the Durham community, and facilitate endowment-related communications between interested student groups and the administration promptly. We also reiterate our request to Duke to prohibit research funding from fossil fuel companies and climate denial foundations. Such funding skews the results in favor of fossil fuels and provides legitimacy to a relationship between academic research and a planet-killing industry. We want to see Duke make concrete goals and systemic changes instead of only advertising its Climate Commitment.

Duke needs spicy food,Jessica Luan,2024-04-02T04:00:00Z,Apr,2,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/040224-luan-spicy-food-20240402.html,"My senior spring couldn’t feel more different from freshman spring, and not just because of the absence of a global pandemic. As a freshman, I used to feel a constant low-humming excitement, uncertainty and anxiety about the next three years. Now, I just feel senioritis — the highs and lows of my Duke career have quieted this background noise. Duke blue face coverings and mandatory outdoor dining are relics of the past, thank goodness. Alas, so are Cafe’s Nutella crepes and other nutty delights. Duke Dining’s last attempts at spiciness are also part of this bygone era. Ginger + Soy used to serve a punchy sambal sauce, and Sazón served a fiery habanero sauce, but both disappeared my sophomore year. I haven’t enjoyed a mouth-watering meal since their removal. I believe that spicy dishes should return to WU to reignite that exciting taste I was fortunate to experience during my underclassmen years. First, spicy food adds something new to WU’s flavor rotation. Spicy sauces would break the duopoly of sweet (eel sauce, barbecue sauce, sweet chili sauce) and creamy sauces (cilantro aioli, spicy mayo). Spiciness also helps to cut through — or perhaps necessitates — bread or rice, both of which abound in WU’s bountiful bowls, sides and sandwiches. Spiciness also helps to mask funky flavors or textures, such as occasionally overcooked chicken. Not only does spicy food taste good, but it feels great too. It is the perfect antidote to Durham’s humid weather, which combined with summer heat, makes everything (save for free LocoPops) seem unappetizing. Eye-watering dishes or condiments can make eating stimulating and enjoyable despite the mugginess outside. Additionally, sharing spicy food with friends can make for everlasting memories consisting of tingling mouths, cry-laughing and the communal relief of gulping down ice water after indulging in a fiery meal. Neither sweet treats nor salty bar eats create connection as intensely as life-or-death spicy foods. Finally, spicy food helps fulfill Duke Dining’s mission of delivering a ""fresh-thinking, world-class"" culinary experience to students, faculty and visitors. Given how much Duke Dining trots out its international inspirations, it’s ironic that spiciness — a sensation beloved in the American South and around the world — is conspicuously absent. American consumers are increasingly preferring spicy food, driving restaurant chains and frozen food companies to launch new products to accommodate changing tastes. If Duke Dining wants to uphold its reputation as ""one of the most innovative, dynamic and cutting edge collegiate dining programs,"" it should get ahead of this shift and proactively provide genuinely spicy options. To be fair, there are some spicy offerings: the jalapeños at It’s Thyme, the habanero coleslaw at Sazón, the spicy tuna at Ginger + Soy, the chicken-65 at Tandoor and the wings at Il Forno are just a few examples. Yet, few of these foods are as spicy as they sound or could be.Of course, spicy food is not universally loved. Some students cannot physically tolerate spice, while others do not prefer it. However, I hope that students at least have the option either to enjoy something familiar or to try something new. Spicy food at WU is not a need but a want. Students currently enjoy food that is healthy, plentiful and delicious. From a culinary and nutritional standpoint, we don’t need much else. We also don’t need to beat UNC, nor do we need six NCAA championships or Metro Boomin for LDOC. But we kind of do. These events engender intense passion, leaving Duke students craving more. Spicy food is a delicious way to bring some heat to the Duke experience. Jessica Luan is a Trinity senior. Her column typically runs on alternate Fridays."
More like Duke 'Secret Government': Uncovering the truth of DSG,Monday Monday,2024-04-01T04:00:00Z,Apr,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/040124-monday-monday-duke-student-government-20240401.html,"Election season at Duke has come and gone. This past Wednesday, politically engaged students were able to exercise their civic right to vote to cast a ballot in the Duke Student Government (DSG) election for one of two behemoth political parties: Candidate and Write-In. Even though democracy has triumphed yet again, many students are still left pondering the age-old question: What does DSG actually do? Monday Monday hears your pleas and delivers on the dedicated yellow journalism you have come to trust. Monday Monday recently sent an anonymous correspondent to infiltrate the DSG Senate in an attempt to retrieve some answers. What follows is their first-hand account from that day.It was a drab, rainy Wednesday evening, and I, correspondent Wednesday Wednesday, was on a mission. To best grasp the mystery of DSG, I knew I first had to become unrecognizable, invisible. I donned a fake mustache, platform Doc Martens, an athlete backpack, AirPod Maxs and a PikeApp hoodie and became the unidentifiable Duke Student. My first challenge was entering the meeting of the senate. As I descended the steps of Old Chemistry 116, I was greeted by two tall, muscular pubpol majors boasting McKinsey quarter zips that were just a bit too tight. They stopped me and looked over a sheet of paper.""You’re not on the list,"" they said in unison. I nodded and confirmed the horrible, ugly truth: I was not one of their kind.""You must be mistaken,"" they said, ""No member of the public has ever voluntarily entered a senate session since its founding."" There was no mistake: I was stepping where no member of the public had gone before. With some hesitancy, the two guards let me through. I entered the room of grandeur and pulled up a chair. It was as if I had taken a seat at the Roman Colosseum, awaiting the great minds below to make a battle of wits to rival that of Socrates, or surely Lincoln and Douglass. Before the meeting even started, senators were warming up their hemming and hawing, stretching their arms to prepare to be the first to vote ""yes"" on whatever legislation came before them. In the corner, I spotted a team of hard-working students grinding out Canva graphics to put on Instagram. I sat in the back row, thumbs ready to twiddle. Finally, a gavel slammed against a podium at the front of the room. ""Order!"" called the figure behind the podium, a mysterious silhouette shrouded in black robes. ""The first item on our agenda is an update from the committee on committee updates. Committee on committee updates, what updates do you have?""One student, a senator, rose. The shrouded figure pointed their gavel, recognizing the student. ""I am excited to share that we have made much progress from last year,"" the student began, ""For one, we have increased the number of surveys we have sent out to the student body by 250%!"" Thunderous applause broke out across the room.""Further,"" the student continued, ""The DSG Reform Taskforce has successfully reformed DSG,"" the student explained. ""This year we were able to get a whole referendum passed that changed our constitution!""""Thank you, senator,"" said the speaker at the front of the room. ""Could you please clarify which reforms passed this year?"" ""I cannot answer that,"" answered the senator, ""For I am just a measly associate vice chair for updates on updates. For that information, you may consult my colleague, the associate vice president on explanation of updates for the committee on committee updates."" More applause.""Thank you, senator,"" said the speaker, ""Unfortunately, the associate vice chair whose title I forgot is not here today, so we will have to move on.""Another student’s hand shot up.""Speak, senator,"" said the speaker, recognizing the student.""Does DSG plan to issue a response to the administration’s shift to a post-matriculation form of merit scholarship disbursement, which threatens socioeconomic diversity at Duke?""""NO,"" boomed a voice that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere, echoing from all corners of the room. The speaker’s gavel came down, and a trap door opened beneath the student’s seat, plunging her into an abyss below. The senate applauded.""With that, we will move on to funding requests,"" continued the speaker as normal. ""Student Organization Finance Committee please come to the front to be recognized."" A student moved to the front of the room and began to click through slides of student organization requests. With lightning speed, thousands of dollars were issued for various space reservations, speakers and glowsticks. With each slide, a gavel clap, a ""PASS!"" and a round of applause. This, I understood, was where power was truly held: in the unanimous approval of Student Organization Finance Committee (SOFC) recommendations. I was scribbling faster than my mind could keep up. But by this time, people had begun to take notice of my presence. I noticed students turning and whispering. Finally, one student sitting in the row before me raised his hand and was recognized. ""I would like to bring to the attention of the speaker that there is an imposter in our midst. Someone … other,"" said the student before me. A loud gasp. ""I move we instate super secret quiet time.""With a blink of an eye, the two McKinsey-clad pubpol majors descended upon me, grabbing my arms and whisking me away. ""You can’t do this!"" I cried, kicking and thrashing. ""I registered for this event on DukeGroups!"" But it was too late — the gavel came down, and with another ""PASS!"" I was tossed outside. The doors of Old Chemistry slammed with a thud behind me. It seems the workings of DSG remain a closely guarded secret for now. Hopefully, this will change with the next president, as has been promised with every preceding DSG president.Since the last Senate session, Monday Monday is convinced that they are being followed by pubpol majors in McKinsey quarter zips. If their column doesn’t run in two weeks, you know what happened."

There is a kind of teaching through which something happens, confirming what speech-act theorists teach — words do things. This kind of teaching emphasizes action, not just words. Rather than a telling, it is a doing, a showing.I remember — probably like you do — former schoolteachers or professors who ignited a flame in my intellect and heart, captivating my imagination about a subject matter. I wanted to learn more (except in the case of my undergraduate computer science course about the C programming language — I’m still having nightmares about that one!).Mrs. Esch was one of those teachers. Mrs. Esch (who years later became Dr. Esch) was my second-grade teacher at Parkway Elementary School. Brimming with energy, she had a committed, intentional, fast-paced walk. She kept an upright piano in her classroom, and I still remember her leading us in singing in her southern accent, ""On top of spaghetti all covered with cheese, I lost my poor meatball when somebody sneezed …"" I have no clue why we sang that song, but what she demonstrated was the power of music as a source of education beyond words. Linking pedagogy with acoustemology, Mrs. Esch understood the impact of the arts on children.More than any specific lesson, Mrs. Esch embodied belief in me. One time she gave me the opportunity to say the Pledge of Allegiance over the school loudspeaker. That morning as she walked me to the office to recite it, she held my hand; she was so proud of me. She may not have known it at the time, but she was nurturing an aptitude for public speech in me, sowing seeds for a future that would involve lots of public speaking.As I reflect on her impact, I recognize that the purpose of teaching is not solely about information but transformation. In his book ""The Courage to Teach,"" the educator Parker Palmer writes, ""Education is about healing and wholeness. It is about empowerment, liberation, transcendence, about renewing the vitality of life."" Palmer names the sacred at the heart of knowing, teaching and learning and wants to reclaim it ""from an essentially depressive mode of knowing that honors only data, logic, analysis and a systematic disconnection of self from the world, self from others.""We’ve heard it before — that you may not remember what people said, but you’ll remember how they made you feel. Teaching is like that; it’s more than a scripted lesson for the day. Unfortunately, there are some teachers who will even belittle students, causing them to shrink into themselves and lock their minds into little boxes of thoughtless fear, rather than expand and enlarge their imaginations, lives and hearts.Yet there are still so many other teachers who inspire us to be free and fully alive. That includes people who don’t hold the official title of ""teacher"" or ""professor."" Professor Bell Hooks reminds us of this in her book ""Teaching Community"" when she writes, ""We are not just teachers when we enter our classrooms but are teachers in every moment of our lives."" Anyone can be a teacher by teaching with their life. So, let’s live so as to teach lessons that set people free and to point them toward becoming whole and healed.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel. His column runs on alternate Mondays.

On love and other things,Susan Chemmanoor,2024-03-29T13:41:00Z,Mar,29,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/032924-chemmanoor-love-romcom-romance-20240329.html,"My childhood perception of love was one of cosmic nature. I was convinced that my eventual love would rival the devotion from legends. Love would feel like Romeo seeing Juliet for the first time. It would be a holy call to action. I thought it would feel like how music makes it seem. I blame poets for my misperceptions. In ""Talk,"" Hozier sings that he would be the ""choiceless hope in grief that drove [Orpheus] underground"" in search of his lost Eurydice, portraying a love that bridges the land of the living and the dead. In ""Sara Smile,"" Daryl Hall & John Oates simply sing, ""It’s you and me forever."" a love that can’t be broken by the relentless passing of time because it’s made from stronger stuff. Frank Marshall Davis pens, ""I think the summer sun would be jealous of your hair,"" speaking of a fondness that allows a human to rival a cosmic giant. Walt Whitman writes, ""There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little, perhaps not a word."" A love that transcends the effort of language. So, for a long time, I thought love shouldn’t have to rely on effort or measly words. I was sold this image of steadfast adoration — almost religious devotion. I believed destiny would sort out the issue of love for me. A rom-com recently popped that bubble. It’s called ""Plus One.""It’s a 2018 not-so-classic rom-com that follows two college friends who vow to be each other's plus-ones for their summer slew of weddings. Ben, a steadfast believer in soulmates, falls for Alice, an honest non-believer. The movie is a sort of bait-and-switch. The first half feels like a classic friends-to-lovers rom-com. It was rife with over-exposed montages, awkward confessions and comfort. But then came the gut punch. In a fight between the newly minted couple, Ben confesses that he’s been having doubts about Alice. Doubts that she’s not the fated “one.” Alice begs him to simply ""try."" Ben refuses. Alice walks away. Then silence. The movie forces you to sit with the loneliness of not being in love. Ben and Alice watch friend after friend get married. We watch them burn through TV dinners, do puzzles alone to distract themselves from the silence and contemplate if they’ll ever find a person to call home. It’s a stunning portrait of the quiet horrors of suburbia. It’s suffocating and poignant and scary. Ben eventually comes to his senses. In the movie’s classic ""big speech"" ending, Ben realizes that love isn’t about soulmates or meet-cutes or destiny. Endearingly, he says it’s about finding someone you want to hang out with for as long as humanly possible. To boil the staggering concept of love down to an eternal hangout session is weirdly perfect. Love is not a divine act. There will be no higher voice compelling you to a person. Instead, love is a choice. An action that requires deliberate effort. Marriage is not led by godly intervention. It’s an agreement to simply try. It’s never going to be perfect. It is not a decision pre-approved by destiny.Ben is a person ruined by his glorified ideal of love. But, I fear most of us are. Most of us tirelessly look for our perfect person. I think eventually, we’ll realize they don’t exist. We chase imaginary ideals that distract from the people in front of us. What a scary thought that is. To be so invested in looking for the right love that you can’t recognize it when it’s in front of you. Maybe none of this is novel to you, but I’m young and at that stage of life where the real world looms in the near distance — the uncomfortable stage of chrysalis where fixtures of modern adulthood, like love, beg to be questioned and re-examined.In perhaps the most stirring part of the movie, Ben realizes that waiting and waiting and waiting for the right love will leave you alone in the end. It’s akin to Sylvia Plath’s fig tree analogy. In ""The Bell Jar,"" Plath’s character Esther imagines her life as a branching fig tree, whose fruit are her possible life choices. Every fig represents a new life she could have: an Olympic crew champion, an infamous poet, a housewife. Yet, in the face of such ample possibility, Esther remains paralyzed by her indecision. So, she sits in the crook of the tree, starving, as she watches figs wither and fall to her feet. The tree personifies the feeling of young adulthood: constantly at a crossroads and saturated by possibility but weighed down by hesitation. But ""Plus One"" says we are not doomed to die at the foot of the fig tree. ""Plus One"" begs us to pick a fig and see what happens. While it's not the most pithy resolution, there’s something quietly radical about it. The carpe diem-esque outlook ""Plus One"" has on love takes the pressure off of it. And it makes sense. We’re in a constant state of flux. Every minute we’re deciding who we want to be this month, trying to figure out if bangs suit our face, and contemplating if we really like our major. All that in addition to the colossal mental effort it takes to simply take care of ourselves amidst the noise of being a student. Being additionally bogged down by chasing the possibility of amorous destiny seems like a waste of time. In doing so, we make love so much more complicated than it should be. Love is not about intertwined fates. It’s so much simpler. It’s about waiting for them to tie their shoes while your group of friends continues ahead. It’s about listening and patience and deep-rooted understanding. It’s about memorizing their karaoke songs and gossiping together after parties. It’s about knowing how they take their coffee and knowing what keeps them up at night. Love doesn’t have to be this awful, scary thing. It’s why we were put here in the first place. To bask in each other's presence. To simply exist with our fellow man. Maybe you won’t have so many revelations when you watch the movie yourself, but I can guarantee it’ll make you think. Or at the very least, it’ll make you smile.""Plus One"" is intimate and nauseatingly honest. It’s cheesy and gut-wrenching and tangibly real. So, this weekend, give it a watch.

Ordering destruction,Aaron Siegle,2024-03-29T13:07:00Z,Mar,29,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/032924-siegle-ordering-destruction-20240329.html,"Do you ever wonder what happens to your food waste when it magically disappears on the dish return at WU? Well, we found out when the dish conveyor belt broke down just a few weeks ago. In its place were trash cans and recycling bins filled with a pastiche of unsorted waste. Compostable to-go boxes stuffed the trash can while the contents of the recycling bin ranged from half-eaten chicken to ice cream cones. Notably absent was a bin for composting. Evidently, Duke’s food waste wasn’t being handled as I had once thought.An overreliance on takeout boxes has hamstrung Duke Dining’s sustainability aspirations. While disposable containers are simple, flexible and reduce employee labor, they also generate an insane quantity of waste — that often goes unseen. Even if carryout boxes are made of compostable materials, a regenerative product cycle relies on users placing the containers in compost bins. Students don’t necessarily prefer to use takeout boxes but are often left with no other choice. Many dining locations only offer carryout containers and single-use utensils. The mobile order app, often used due to its convenience, does not allow users to choose reusable dining ware. Promoting reusable dining ware would reduce unnecessary waste and streamline Duke’s composting process.In 2018, Duke Dining banned single-use plastics across campus. Instead, disposable products are made of polylactic acid (PLA), a biodegradable material derived from corn starch. While the ban was a significant step forward, PLA has its own drawbacks. PLA will only biodegrade under a specific set of conditions, meaning that it must be sorted out of the standard recycling stream. If a takeout container made of PLA ends up in a landfill, then it will take at least a century to decompose, resulting in potent methane emissions. In other words, for PLA to be truly biodegradable, it must first wind up in an industrial compost facility.Often, that’s not the case.In theory, the PLA waste cycle is closed, with the product’s end-of-life destination being compost, which can be used as an alternative fertilizer. However, the weak point in the loop is the user, who may or may not throw their to-go box in the compost bin. Data from the Duke Waste Audit shows that 58% of items in trash bins are actually compostable. Recycling bins aren’t that far behind at 48%. If one waste stream is too diluted with items that don’t belong in it, then the efficacy of the process is severely compromised. Furthermore, compost that is cluttered with non-compostable waste costs Duke extra to compost, disincentivizing the university from continuing the program.This begs the question, why rely on compostable disposables in the first place?The answer lies in changes made as a response to COVID-19. Since most students have no experience of pre-COVID dining, imagining pre-COVID Duke Dining can be difficult.In short, COVID hit Duke Dining pretty hard. Marketplace was forced to shut down amidst a Covid outbreak among its employees. This led to long lines at replacement food trucks sent to East Campus and uncertainty around campus. To overcome these volatile conditions, Duke Dining expanded two of its key programs: mobile ordering and takeout containers.While I couldn’t find out if the use of to-go boxes increased as a result of the pandemic, COVID has undisputedly changed our dining habits. During the pandemic, mobile orders made up 45% of sales across campus. Since the Duke Dine-Out app only allows for to-go orders, the number of single-use disposables has also risen.Although the app has the phrase “Dine-Out” in its name, many students (myself included) use the app for meals that they eat in Wu. Why? The app allows you to skip long lines, often has more choices than are offered in person and frees up time to do other things. In effect, Duke is forcing students to choose between using mobile order or promoting sustainability.However, these initiatives don’t have to be mutually exclusive. The mobile order app can be reprogrammed to allow the user to request a reusable plate and utensils. Students could now utilize the efficiency of mobile orders while also limiting the university’s waste footprint.Well, won’t this plan suffer from the low participation rate that other Duke Dining sustainability initiatives experienced?Currently, Duke Dining has both a Reusable Mug Program and a Reusable To-Go Container Program. You even get a 20% discount off your drink for ordering it in a reusable mug. Both programs are significantly underutilized due to a lack of awareness and high barriers to entry. I’m sure many students would love to participate but have never heard about either of the programs. Even for someone who knows about and wants to participate, enrollment is still challenging. For the reusable mug program, you must buy and remember to bring your own mug, as opposed to the vendor providing a mug for you. While reusable to-go containers are provided, I have filled out the form to enroll in the program and received no response. Promoting reusable dining ware requires a setup that is both simple and intuitive for students to use.Sustainable dining at Duke is something that everyone wants. Small tweaks to the ordering and waste disposal process can go a long way in reducing disposable consumption.First, Duke must require restaurants to offer an option of reusable dining ware. Many popular eateries such as Panera Bread, It’s Thyme and Pitchforks don’t offer reusable containers. Targeting the few locations that generate an outsized amount of waste will net the greatest impact.Second, Duke should make ordering reusable dining ware an option on the mobile order app. Given the popularity of mobile orders, additional flexibility will increase accessibility to sustainable options.Third, the current sustainable dining programs should be user-centric. Responding to sign-ups, advertising the benefits of the program and expanding the number of locations that participate in the programs will ensure their growth.Just because our food waste is out of sight doesn’t mean that it should be out of mind. Let’s remind Duke that the best form of waste diversion is avoiding single-use disposables altogether.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity sophomore. His column typically runs on alternate Fridays."
So long lives this,Anna Garziera,2024-03-27T04:00:00Z,Mar,27,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/032724-garziera-so-long-lives-this-20240327.html,"""So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.""— Shakespeare’s Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?Human capital is losing its value as fast as our dollars these days. In an increasingly automated world, we are less and less independent. 500 years ago, we still knew how to knit stockings. 200 years ago, we still knew how to gather wheat and milk cows. 20 years ago, we still knew how to use indexes. Two years ago, we still knew how to write.Like it or not, the use of AI is spreading like wildfire on college campuses. More than ever, students are using AI to complete assignments, or at least to give themselves an advantage. This practice is on the rise among all disciplines. However, AI use is most prevalent in subjects that require students to write.There are two reasons for this. Firstly, it is easier to ask ChatGPT to write an essay than to compute integrals. Often, by the time you’ve worked out how to type “rho” into the text box, you may as well just have computed the integral yourself. Some don’t trust ChatGPT to compute math problems correctly altogether. Secondly, writing is difficult to begin. Staring at a blank page is terrifying. ChatGPT offers a promising starting point.Professors are adapting in their own ways. Some have started using AI-detecting technology to address cheating with AI. Others take the opposite approach, and even encourage their students to use AI in their assignments. Debates on the role of AI in the future of education are rampant. Here at Duke, there is an entire masters program dedicated to AI and machine learning. Other schools have banned AI completely.No matter which side of the debate you land on, two things remain undeniable. Firstly, AI has both benefits and consequences. Acknowledging this is important so that we may both celebrate its strengths and correct its shortcomings. Secondly, even in an AI-forward world, learning how to write is still important.A friend recently asked me whether I thought that some of my colleagues at The Chronicle used AI to write their articles. I was shocked, not only because I had never really tried to use AI (I tend to hold a grudge against technology of all kinds), but also because I couldn't fathom the idea of someone cheating on something they're volunteering for. The benefit we reap from writing is the writing itself.This got me thinking — why do we write? We're definitely not getting paid to do it. Most of us writers at The Chronicle would probably land somewhere between “because we enjoy it” and “because it might look good on our resume.” Yet, with the same amount of time we spend writing our articles, we could arguably indulge in more enjoyable activities or do something more valuable for our resumés. There’s one more reason that is more difficult to pinpoint. We feel that our writing makes us better people.Whether witnessing our writing develop with every published article or feeling natural inspirations, we can feel ourselves improving.In a way, this is true for all disciplines. Why does a tennis player continue to show up for practice? Why does a chef keep refining his recipe when it is already so tasty? Sure, there are external motivators, such as money and praise. But at the same time, it’s undeniable: Improvement is so gratifying.Then, becoming better writers should be a common goal for us college students. This skill is valuable in a multitude of ways.For centuries, writing has been the primary way of preserving information in the western world. With scripture, we are able to pass it down to future generations in a way that is accurate and pristine. Consider the fact that professors gain their credibility through the papers they published. Consider the fact that there are hundreds of disciplines — English Literature, History, Biblical Studies, Law — that dedicate themselves to studying others’ writing. As aspiring academics, we need good writing in our toolkits.Furthermore, to write well is to persuade. I first learned this in my AP English Language class, when we were asked to analyze Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech. While the speech was effective because of King’s passionate delivery, his success nevertheless started with the pen to paper.In a school as industry-driven as Duke, it is surprising how little we students appreciate certain life skills that are invaluable to our future careers. Writing is one of them. From crafting cover letters for job applications to delivering clear and concise memos to establishing smooth communication with clients, good writing is key to excelling in most professional industries.However, good written communication is not only key to our future careers, but we see its importance everywhere in our lives. A well-written email can land you an internship. A well-written Reddit post can evoke hundreds of replies. A well-written journal entry can preserve your precious memories.Thus, as much as it’s tempting to ask AI to write our essays for us, we students must resist. Not so much because cheating is against the Duke Community Standard and not because our professors might catch us and fail us and be disappointed, but because learning how to write well is important.Here we are, young students at a top university, in a place where all is asked of us is to learn. Let’s not throw away this opportunity — it might cost us dearly later on.Anna Garziera is a Trinity first-year. Her column typically runs on alternate Wednesdays."
What your major says about you (part 2),Alex Berkman,2024-03-26T04:00:00Z,Mar,26,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/032624-berkman-major-says-about-you-two-20240326.html,"New kink discovered at Duke: Apparently students love to be degraded.I only say this because after the publication of my last piece, I had a surprising number of individuals complain that I did not aggressively insult their major and thus transitively themselves. In fact, multiple students came up to me and said:""How could you not include psych?""""Where was math?""And ""Why didn’t you write about English majors?"" (I must admit, this one didn’t actually happen. I would never be friends with an English major.)So I suppose not only do Duke students have a fetish for degradation, but also are used to being the center of attention ALL THE TIME.I even had one person DM me on LinkedIn (I didn’t even know this was a feature) and tell me that I was “hella invalid” for not including computer science. Okay, chief. I was also surprised to see this because I had initially thought the only phrases LinkedIn allows you to say are “Congratulations, (insert name),” “So well deserved!”, “Big things ahead!”, and my personal favorite: “I cannot wait to see everything you accomplish.” Give me a break. But because so many have now asked that I write about their major, I have decided to go forth with a part two for ""what your major says about you.""Let’s get into it.Computer ScienceSure, computer science (compsci) may be the most popular major at Duke, comprised of the greatest number of students. But despite their large numbers, each and every comp sci major falls into one of two distinct archetypes. First, we have the students who actually like computer science. And for this group, they not only enjoy coding, they live for it. ""Hey, do you want to go out for lunch?""""I can’t, I’m coding.""""Hey do you want to — hmmm I don't know — take a shower?""""I’m coding right now. Maybe in a month.""""What about the beach? We should go to the beach. It’s so beautiful out.""""You mean the one outside with the sand and water and stuff?""""Ya, that one.""""Pass.""I must applaud this student for your devotion to your craft, and I envy your passion and diligence. You are truly an inspiration. After all, you have shown all of us that you can still be successful without any semblance of a social life, unless you count online relationships with @pinkfairyprincess73.Now, for the second type of compsci student — of which I am honestly reluctant to even give a platform — we have the most pick-me students at this university. They are born and bred from the same crop as our beloved econ majors, but these folks are different. Or at least, they like to think so. Some of them do likely enjoy coding, but don’t be fooled: Their motivation for majoring in computer science has little to do with neither love nor passion. Rather, it is likely they once read a Wall Street Journal or Forbes piece about which majors have the greatest ROI. And the truth is, if they were to be offered a job at Goldman but were told they could never code again, they wouldn’t even think twice. Foreign LanguageNow, behold: We have our future translators and customer service reps at Enterprise Rent-A-Car. I must admit — it is refreshing to see a group of students that for once are not so career oriented and are simply driven by learning. Still, I remain unsure as to why you must spend $80,000 per year to become semi-fluent in a language. After all, 99% of the globe would simply use the internet or textbooks, and they would become fluent in a shorter period of time for cheaper. MUCH cheaper. But hey, you can’t put a price on an experience!But may I warn you — your decision to major in a language comes at a great cost, not only monetary. From a social perspective, you will likely ostracize yourself from your classmates who absolutely despise your enthusiasm for language as they painstakingly slug out three semesters of their mandatory requirement. I did not say this is fair, but that is simply how it is. Still, I wouldn't work yourself up too much over this. Because, at the end of the day, you — and not your Google-Translate-reliant peers — will now be able to write “bilingual” in your Tinder bio.Forget that, actually. People looking for a one night stand do not care much for sophistication. So perhaps, Hinge is a better place to flex your fluency in German. EnglishWell, first let’s get the obvious out of the way: You are a cat person. And I suppose that that is all I really need to know about someone to know to not be friends with them. But besides your love of felines, your passion for reading parallels closely to the comp sci major’s (not the fake ones) love of coding. The only difference is that their interpretation of productivity involves building practical applications to advance human progress and yours involves entrapping yourself in fictitious worlds. When you are not reading or failing to teach your cat how to play fetch, you are likely thinking of ideas for novels that you will never write or insufferably trying to convince your friends that the book is always better than the movie. But how could I fail to mention the poetic elegance by which you communicate? As part of a class assignment, I recently listened to Kevin Quashie, Professor of English at Brown University, deliver a lecture at Duke's 17th Annual Feminist Theory Workshop, which as I am sure you would be shocked to learn was the first feminist workshop I had ever attended. My main takeaway from the talk was not that Quashie was brilliant — although he most certainly is — but rather that English majors are professional yappers. ""The essence of the human body proliferates through the very idiosyncratic representations of the mind and transitory self.""Okay, there’s got to be a simpler way to say that. The only thing worse than attempting to understand Quashie was having to sit through the audible and obnoxiously loud ""mmmm’s"" projected by the English majors in the audience as though they had understood a single word uttered by Quashie beyond ""the.""Stop GATEKEEPING the English language. Thank you very much. MathTruthfully, I don’t have much to say about math majors, and that is for two reasons. First off, I am officially emotionally drained after projecting so much negativity onto people I have never met before. And second, I have trouble trying to put myself inside the head of a joyless human robot. No offense, of course.However, while I do not have many — if any — friends that are math majors, you all do seem like a civil group that keeps to themselves. And, I cannot help but admire or perhaps aspire to be as intelligent as you are — likely the major with the highest average IQ on campus. If only, you could donate but 20 of such points to your EQ score. Then, you would know how to approach a potential love interest without freezing and throwing up on their feet.SociologyI must admit — until recently, I had thought sociology to be some form of athletic training program for Duke basketball players planning to go pro. But apparently sociology is an academic, not athletic program that just happens to be the major of every basketball player and what seems to be over half of Duke’s athletes. But for you NARPs (non-athletic regular people) out there, feel free to hop on the sociology bandwagon as well. It most certainly has its perks. The main appeal, of course, is that you should almost certainly graduate with a 4.0 GPA — unless you miss 90% of the classes or you endure a traumatic head injury that reduces your IQ to that of a pumpkin. And even then, you may slip away with an A-. So to you sociology majors, I ask that you please refrain from patting yourself on the back when your shiny new report card comes in. Now, unfortunately for this crowd, their high GPAs often go to waste, for not a single employer in their right mind would ever hire a sociology major. Unless of course they too once made the foolish mistake to be a sociology major and have now made it their philanthropic mission to take up the waning souls of those who were misled to believe that the ""scientific study of social relationships and institutions"" serves any practical benefit in the real world. Parting ThoughtsI am aware that I have left out quite a few majors from this piece (sorry psychology majors). But let it be known that if your major was not included, it is simply because I only have incredible things to say about you and your kind. Okay, that is a complete lie, I just did not have the time. Regardless, I hope that you have enjoyed or at least gotten a good laugh from this piece and its predecessor. Again, please don’t take my words too seriously. At the end of the day, all is written in good fun. Alex Berkman is a Trinity sophomore. His column typically runs on alternate Tuesdays."
Duke Asian Students Association endorses Heather Raslan for DSG president,Asian Students Association,2024-03-25T15:25:00Z,Mar,25,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/032524-duke-asian-students-association-dsg-endorsement-20240325.html,"The Duke Asian Students Association is excited to see three accomplished candidates who contribute unique strengths for the DSG Presidency this year. After reviewing each candidate’s platforms, watching the Presidential Debate, and meeting all candidates who reached out to ASA, we have chosen to endorse Heather Raslan for DSG President. This decision comes after careful deliberation — while all candidates have shown clear passion for how they can best serve the undergraduate student body, ASA believes that Heather has the most promising and thoughtful platform for the next academic year.Representation is not simply ensuring the existence of particular identities in decision-making spaces; rather, as Heather quoted from Paola Ramos during the debate, it is more pertinently about acknowledging one’s position of power by looking around the room and consciously inviting the people who should be there but are not. In our experience as ASA co-presidents, we believe that Heather, during her tenure as Vice President of Academic Affairs and throughout her campaign, has exemplified this principle in ways that value the voices of affinity groups and students. We are impressed by her goals for the Presidency that center sustainable partnerships, transparency and open channels of communication, as well as her initiative in providing avenues of accountability for her as an individual and DSG at large. In addition, her VP role and three years of experience within DSG have set her up to best represent students and navigate the interfaces between students, organizations and administration.Heather will have the most positive and influential impacts serving our campus, and we support her thoughtful goals for our student body and for DSG. Her desire and dedication to make DSG a more inclusive and effective organization are reasonable and remarkable, and we are excited to offer her our endorsement.Carina Lei, Trinity ‘25, and Joy Shijia Tong, Pratt ‘25Duke Asian Students Association Co-PresidentsRecused: NoneAbsent: None"

Redefining health support at Duke: A call for STINF policy reform,Barbara Cardenas,2024-03-25T12:54:00Z,Mar,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/032524-cardenas-redefining-stinf-20240325.html,"At Duke, the current policy governing Short-Term Illness Notifications (STINFs) offers a scant three days per semester for student absences due to illness without the need for medical documentation. While this policy might seem compassionate at first glance, its limitations quickly become apparent, especially when facing the unpredictable nature of health challenges. I believe it's time for Duke to critically reassess and significantly expand the STINF policy. By doing so, we can move towards a more inclusive, supportive and health-conscious academic framework that better addresses the diverse needs of our student body.The complex landscape of student healthThe foundational intent behind the STINF policy — to afford students a brief respite from academic responsibilities during health-related challenges — is commendably straightforward. Yet, the application of this policy reveals a stark oversight of the varied and unpredictable health issues that can afflict students. Mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression and stress-related conditions, alongside prolonged physical illnesses, are examples of when the policy falls short. The prevailing assumption that all health issues can be neatly resolved within a mere three-day span is not only outdated but dangerously dismissive of the realities of both physical illnesses and mental health crises. From severe flu episodes and mononucleosis to debilitating depressive episodes, the range of health issues that students can face varies widely in both duration and impact on their academic capabilities.Adding to the complexity is the procedural discomfort and stress involved in requesting additional STINF days, a process that is especially fraught for those dealing with mental health issues. The current requirement to disclose one's health situation to deans or professors, albeit typically met with understanding, imposes an additional emotional burden on students. This requirement often discourages students from seeking the support they desperately need, exacerbating their stress and vulnerability.A call for tangible solutionsAddressing these challenges necessitates a comprehensive reform of the STINF policy. An initial step should be to increase the STINF allocation to at least five days per semester — a full academic week. This adjustment would provide students with the necessary flexibility to manage their health without the looming threat of academic penalties. Recognizing the variability of health issues and the time required for recovery, this policy revision would reflect a more realistic and compassionate approach to student health.Furthermore, the establishment of a streamlined process for requesting additional STINF days could significantly alleviate the current procedural discomfort. An improved online submission system, designed to maintain student privacy while efficiently managing STINF requests, could address these concerns. This system would anonymize student submissions but assign a unique identifier to each student, known only to a designated administrator. Professors would be notified of approved absences through this system, ensuring privacy. The system could also track the number of STINF days each student has used, keeping deans informed without compromising student anonymity. This approach would reduce the emotional toll on students while preserving the integrity of the process.Addressing concernsCritics might contend that expanding the number of STINF days could inadvertently encourage abuse of the policy, with students potentially exploiting the system for unwarranted absences. This argument, however, overlooks the broader benefits of a more flexible and compassionate policy framework. By instituting a requirement for consultation with Duke Wellness for absences that extend beyond the initially allocated STINF days, the university can ensure that students receive the appropriate support while maintaining the integrity of the academic process. This balanced approach respects student autonomy and health needs while safeguarding the educational standards that Duke upholds.Envisioning a health-conscious campus cultureExtending the number of STINF days, coupled with procedural improvements and enhanced faculty training, recognizes the reality of student life, respects the complexity of health issues and reaffirms Duke’s dedication to the holistic well-being of its students. By acknowledging the complex nature of student health and the inherent challenges of navigating academic responsibilities amidst health crises, Duke has the opportunity to lead by example in the realm of higher education.The university stands at a crossroads, with the opportunity to redefine its approach to student health — a chance to ensure that every student has the support they need to thrive academically and personally, irrespective of the health challenges they may face. By embracing these changes, Duke can affirm its role as a leading institution that values and actively supports the health and success of its student body.Barbara Cardenas is a Trinity junior.

"Dating apps are good, actually",Heidi Smith,2024-03-25T04:00:00Z,Mar,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/032524-smith-dating-apps-good-20240325.html,"I used to hate dating apps as much as the next person — which is to say, viscerally. A couple of years ago, I was having breakfast with a friend, and he challenged my dislike. I couldn’t think of anything original to say. So, I figured I’d put my money where my mouth is and give them a go: I’d probably hate them, but at least I’d get some stories out of it. However, as you can probably guess from the title, I instead changed my mind. Because, to be honest, you can’t really know until you try. You could have reasons against using them — such as a religious principle or already being in a relationship — but an aversion without trial is not the same as an opinion crafted through an informed assay.While dating apps are generally a positive tool for the broader population, they are especially handy on a university’s campus. College is the canonical time to “discover yourself” and figure out what you want from life; relationships are no exception. While I previously wrote about the pressure of having romantic relationships, this time, I’ll focus more on casual, sexual ones. While I know people who have found their partner on Tinder, casual relationships tend to be more of the norm — particularly for younger folks.Sure, it’s great to meet people organically — except when it isn’t, and your safety is threatened. The same is true of relationships initiated online — sometimes, boundaries can be violated. However, the immediacy of the apps provides the possibility of safer meetups. It’s no news flash that college campuses are hotbeds for sexual assault. Particularly in situations involving alcohol, consent can be a nebulous concept. Perhaps at Duke, more so than other institutions, we have a history of inextricable entwinement of drinking and sexual assault.About a year ago, my best friend called me and told me to Google a pretend thesis made by a female Duke student in 2010 detailing her sexual escapades since his professor had mentioned it in class. This “thesis” gives a glimpse into what hookup culture here looked like a decade and a half ago — at least for one woman. While Karen Owens, the author, was perhaps a bit too far ahead of her time in attempting to chronicle her sex life in a parody of how men canonically discuss women, I was struck by how integral drinking was to her hookups. While this message may not have been so ingrained in our societal consciousness in the aughts, consent cannot be fully given unless sober.She describes many of her hookups initiating at Shooters — often while drunk, if not close to blacking out. While that surely still happens today, it is (thankfully) not the primary way of finding casual sexual partners — though the particulars probably depend on any given person’s social affiliations. Going on a Tinder date with someone and having sex is likely going to involve more consent than going home from Shooters with someone. Sure, you can plan a date at a bar or another drinking venue. However, alcohol is not the required means by which a hookup occurs, and it’s easier to get to know someone in an environment in which you have more control.Plus, the dialogue about each party’s expectations is more open when both people can opt-in to be seen in a dating pool. Your profile can display what type of relationship you’re looking for and you can discuss specifics before agreeing to meet up. Furthermore, if the other person is being particularly disrespectful, you can block them. Establishing expectations often makes the experience more enjoyable and less stressful. There will always be people you strike out on, but when you meet up with someone you matched with online, you tend to have at least an idea of what your interaction will involve.Dating apps can be particularly important for people seeking relationships outside of societal norms. For example, Grindr — and other apps on which you can set gender preferences — gives queer people a selective filter for nontraditional relationships when it is not always clear in person what someone else is looking for. Whether it is a sexual or romantic orientation or just a current preference, you can find entirely sexual partners or entirely romantic, and every combination in between. Additionally, a desire for monogamy or lack thereof is certainly clearer upfront.Even when looking for something more traditional, the confirmation of someone’s mutual desire can make things more comfortable. On a campus where if you don’t know somebody, you probably know someone who knows them, relationships can get incestuous pretty quickly. Matching with a friend of a friend or peripheral classmate on Tinder can lower the barrier to entry and give both parties a confirmation to move forward without worrying about making things awkward up front.Whether you meet a partner on Bumble or on the bus, the crucial underlying thread is that you are learning more about what you want out of relationships. In my experience, the apps have made it vastly easier to do that. While I haven’t met anyone I’ve pursued anything serious with, I’ve discovered many things I don’t want out of relationships and, by nature, some things I do. I’ve met friends I never would have otherwise. I’ve explored relationships with people I wouldn’t have had the confidence to initiate without digital mediation. Sure, there have been some people that, in hindsight, I could have done without meeting, but at least I usually get a good story out of it, if not also an enjoyable evening.I wanted to hate the apps, to bring some new, nuanced perspective as to why they suck. But, for me — and, admittedly, they do tend to work better for women — Bumble and Tinder have, on the whole, been a positive addition to my college experience. I’m not saying everyone will find the same success and enjoyment, but I think they are worth at least the old college try. It may take a couple of endeavors, but genuinely putting effort into meeting new people seeking similar experiences is rarely a waste of time.Heidi Smith is a Trinity senior.

Bye bye buzzwords,Gabrielle Mollin,2024-03-21T04:00:00Z,Mar,21,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/032124-mollin-buzzwords-conversation-20240321.html,"It’s 70 degrees and sunny, so naturally, I’m sitting outside Perk Café as I begin to write this week’s column. Though this location likely evokes visions of that one picturesque flower tree and slightly awkward campus coffee chats, I’m reminded of a spirited conversation I had here with a friend over a single word: patriarchy. Patriarchy means “rule of the father,” but since the late 20th century, the word has mainly been used and understood to refer to social systems where power is concentrated among men. Sociologist Sylvia Walby has articulated six different social structures that encompass patriarchy: 1) The Household, where women’s housework and childcare go largely uncompensated 2) The Workforce, where women are underpaid and overlooked 3) The State, where women are underrepresented and overregulated 4) Violence, where women are statistically more prone to abuse 5) Sexuality, where women’s sexuality is simultaneously stigmatized and aggrandized 6) Culture, where women’s media and popular culture representation operates under a male gazeBut you really don’t have to know who Sylvia Walby is or be particularly well-read in feminist theory to get the gist of the word. It’s used in academic spaces, casual conversations, comedy sketches and so on. And according to Elon Musk, taking a shot for every “patriarchy” in the Barbie movie will leave you blacked out well before its end. So if this word really is so common, you might be wondering why I had a two-hour debate about it with my close friend. First, context. This friend is a woman. She recently told me that while she acknowledges the existence of sexist individuals in the world, she doesn’t believe we live in a patriarchy. Right off the bat, I found myself up in arms about her comment. I was shocked, shocked because I assumed that as a woman, she would undoubtedly share my perspective. The existence of patriarchy felt like a no-brainer to me. It was a concept my friends and I all understood as reality, allowing us to have meaningful conversations with each other about distinct school or work experiences and crack a few jokes while we were at it. The fact that this friend didn’t believe in a concept I and nearly everyone around me deemed an almost fundamental part of our lives seemed, well … strange. To remedy this seemingly stark divergence in beliefs, we immersed ourselves in conversation outside of Perk Café for a solid two hours. From biological differences and evolutionary history to women’s exclusion from the political process and workforce for the majority of American history to present-day implicit biases and sexual violence, we covered almost all the bases. And in avoiding my homework and midterm studying that day in pursuit of dynamic conversation, I came to a valuable conclusion: We didn’t actually disagree. After a heated first 30 minutes debating the plausibility of male and female equality due to different perspectives on the influence of social and biological forces, we came more or less to an agreement. We both shared experiences of being overlooked in the classroom or workplace. We both found comfort in sharing our excitement about our future careers, but also our anxieties about the seemingly impossible task of balancing motherhood and work. We vocalized our frustration for how the state seeks to regulate women’s bodies, yet fails to legislate policies to protect them. And throughout all of this, not once did either of us use the word patriarchy. What I came to realize was that our disagreement was not one of content, but diction. When it came down to it, her convictions more or less acknowledged the existence of patriarchy; her aversion was not to the concept but to the word itself. Just like with Elon Musk or Ben Shapiro and the Barbie movie, my friend had a problem with the word patriarchy, which is why our conversation became all the more productive when I stopped using it and other feminist buzzwords altogether. And that’s the thing: Productive conversations don’t include buzzwords. Though political buzzwords can usefully define social movements, they inhibit the discourse needed to sustain long-term, widespread social change through rhetorical alienation. Yes, buzzwords are practical shortcuts that can underpin complex issues, but they preach to the already converted. A word like patriarchy, which to me and others in feminist spaces seems perfectly legitimate, is nothing more than an annoying buzzword to many. It’s viewed as a way to control political discourse and impose a certain viewpoint as plain old common sense. And when someone doesn't know the meaning of a buzzword or views the buzzword as political posturing, genuine discourse shuts down at its mention. Although convenient, buzzwords have unparalleled polarizing potential. So why cling to words that hold meaning for a few when we could have conversations that appeal to many? It’s time to bid adieu to the buzzwords we know all too well and step into real, unscripted conversation. Once you do that, you, like my friend and I, may find your disagreement wasn’t really that much more than a (buzz)word or two.Gabrielle Mollin is a Trinity sophomore.

London Bridge is falling down: Deconstructing the colonialist tourist lens,Advikaa Anand,2024-03-21T04:00:00Z,Mar,21,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/032124-anand-deconstructing-colonialist-tourist-lens-20240321.html,"I have dreamed of visiting London for a long time. My tenth-grade English literature class left me fascinated with the vivid pastoral descriptions nestled in poems by Sir Walter Raleigh and John Donne. Awash in these idyllic scenes, I yearned for the day that I too would get to relish the city’s treasures.This past spring break, my dream came true. On our first day in the city, we cruised across the River Thames, in awe of the stupendous architecture surrounding us. It was beautiful, the way that history wedded the present at the river banks. The Gothic reflection of Westminster Abbey loomed large over the water.Yet quickly, a pit developed in my stomach. As I drank in the beauty of this city, I could not help thinking of the complex colonial history concealed behind this magnificent architecture. As we marveled at Buckingham Palace, I could not help wondering how its construction and maintenance had been paid by the blood of millions of people like me: people of color who were exploited in the name of warped notions of glory. Reckoning with the grandeur of Western civilization is a complex undertaking. On the one hand, it feels impossible not to admire its glories. On the other, my heart sinks at the thought of the human cost of this magnificence and the suffering that still endures as a result of these selfish pursuits. Many people are uncomfortable with this logic, reasoning that colonialism is a thing of the past and thus its discussions are futile. Yet, its ramifications bleed into the modern day. Countries in South Asia and Africa, primary sites of resource exploitation, must contend with poor treatment of income and wealth inequality, tenuous government organization, and ongoing intrastate conflict. Additionally, countries with robust histories of colonization must contend with unequal resource distribution, mass human rights violations and religious divisions.Former colonies also face the unique victimization of indigenous populations, with these groups facing increased ""systemic racism, cyclical poverty, economic inequity, violence, loss of language and culture, and an enormous number of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.""I first felt this deep sense of discomfort when we visited the Tower of London. This historic site is often jokingly referred to as a holder of all stolen goods, but this attempt at humor rings hollow, precisely because it conceals the truth. As I walked into the home of the Crown Jewels, I audibly gasped. The walls were studded with glass cases holding treasures from all over the world, such as the Cullinan Diamond, obtained during British exploits in South Africa and the largest diamond ever discovered, and the legendary Koh-i-Noor, one of the largest cuts diamonds whose passage around the world also reflects India’s diverse convoluted history of colonial rules. Here, these jewels were displayed as emblems of British triumphs, relics of a bygone era in which their colonial power reigned across the world. Yet, as the daughter of Indian immigrants, whose grandparents were forced to abandon their homes in modern-day Pakistan due to the divide-and-conquer political tactics pursued by the British, these jewels were also painful reminders of my family’s loss of our ancestral homes and forced displacement. I walked out to behold the grand Tower Bridge, stretching across the two halves of London, and was pierced by a nagging question: How do we reconcile our admiration for a civilization’s great achievements with the harm it has imposed on other people? Too often, we fall into the fallacy of justifying history because it paved the way for the present. During my visit, I heard plenty of explanations that excused British colonial exploits because of a ""natural"" survival-of-the-fittest, zero-sum game that naturally leads to the victory of the most deserving. But just because winners of battles may author the pages of history does not mean that they also triumphed in the moral battle faced by every nation to choose justice over domination. Since I arrived at Duke, I have been consistently encouraged by my professors and peers to question how our history is told. Our class discussions enabled me to analyze history from a variety of perspectives with a critical eye and to always ask whose story has not been told — a critical exercise in my intellectual development that I could not always execute in high school. But while this lens of analysis might find resonance in the classroom, it is often lacking in the layman’s consumption of history. As a result, it is crucial that preservers of this history are transparent about its origins. Every caption explaining an artifact’s source ought to clearly describe its complete history, including any ramifications faced by the losing side of the battle. Open dialogue on the consequences of colonial exploits should be not only encouraged but also facilitated in these spaces. Visitors should be supported in any inquiries that question the morality of the historical actions of all sides of a war. Like human nature, history is not black and white. Each player is complex, saddled with nuances worthy of both condemnation and redemption. We must recognize this fact, and willingly condemn actions that betray our sense of morality.Transparency about the ethics of historical actions outside of its context paves a more equitable future ahead and ensures that our progeny do not suffer in the same way that our ancestors have. Because to learn from history, we must first understand it. Advikaa Anand is a Trinity sophomore. Her column typically runs on alternating Thursdays."

We will accept letters from any student organization, so long as the group adheres to the rules stipulated below. We will not accept personal endorsements from individuals.If student organizations elect not to attend the DSG presidential debate on March 21, they are encouraged to offer to meet with all candidates running for the position being endorsed. If a candidate voluntarily declines to meet, the endorsement meeting may go on as scheduled, and the candidate's absence should be noted in the endorsement letter. To avoid even the appearance of impropriety, The Chronicle expects that members of organizations with significant personal or professional attachments or associations with candidates will remove themselves from the endorsement process for that position. This includes public or substantial participation in the campaign of any one individual. Any conflict of interest that would jeopardize a non-prejudiced review and consideration of a candidate should result in a recusal. If a member of an organization recuses themselves due to conflicts of interest with any one candidate for a position, that member may not participate in the endorsement process at all for that position. This includes asking questions in meetings with the candidates and writing the endorsement. Members of organizations who recuse themselves must be listed as having done so in the text of the endorsement letter.If one of the candidates currently is, was or will be a president or officer of an organization, that organization is precluded from issuing an endorsement for that position in The Chronicle. If an organization wishes to publish an endorsement letter, the president of the organization must email Editor-in-Chief Audrey Wang (editor@dukechronicle.com) and Opinion Editor Viktoria Wulff-Andersen (opinion@dukechronicle.com). All candidates running for each endorsed position must be CC'd on the email as well.The email must include an attached endorsement letter and the following statement: “I, the president of [organization name], certify that all Chronicle endorsement rules were followed in the formulation of this letter. I understand that failure to adhere to the rules undermines the election process, as well as the integrity of my organization and The Chronicle.”Endorsement letters must be signed by the leader of the student organization and include their full name, school and graduation year.

Separate lives,Carol Apollonio,2024-03-20T04:00:00Z,Mar,20,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/032024-apollonio-separate-lives-20240320.html,"How do you guys spend the time you’re not in my class?At 5:00 pm the Allen Building goes dark. You can spot the administration building on any college campus because there is no one in it come happy hour. Their employees — your professors — may linger a bit at their desks and labs. The myth that we only work six hours a week (and that we get our summers ""off"") is a heinous lie. When do you think we learn the things that we’re teaching you? Look up and you’ll see lights sparkling in our offices.Then they too go dark. And the campus is yours.Some years ago, a local theater announced a one-day-only 8:00 p.m. premiere of a brand-new film based on a modern Russian novel. It happened that my students were reading that very book! So I put on my best ""faculty-student interaction"" face and scarfed some free tickets from my boss. When I announced this thrilling — but, I emphasize, completely optional — event to my students, they were fully on board, but one of them said that she could come but only for half an hour; she had a commitment on campus later that evening. Anyway, everyone got into their vehicles, and we met at the cinema. After 30 minutes, the one student stood up discretely and left. And the rest of us watched the film. All as planned. But I’m bewildered. What’s the point of rushing to your automobile, driving 15 minutes, watching the beginning of a movie and then rushing off to something else? Is this typical for all your activities?It reminded me that students have lives outside of class, which follow their own logic, incomprehensible on this side of the podium. Sometimes the veil lifts. A student asks for a paper-draft extension because her student dance group has scheduled a mandatory 20-hours of rehearsal this week. And of course there’s job season. A few years ago a senior in my seminar had to miss seven classes for out-of-town interviews, and was shocked that this meant he could not earn an A. There is a lot going on. You are starting businesses, writing musical comedies, inventing medical devices, discovering cures for diseases, volunteering for political campaigns, designing racecars, doing journalism and big-data research, participating in competitions — science, debate, sports, chess. Performing music, plays, dances. Representing Duke. Finding your partner for life.You are also figuring out innovative ways of letting off steam. Do not tell me what these are.And then there’s what might be going on covertly during actual class. In my world, speaking objectively, there’s nothing more exciting than what we’ve been reading:A notorious lecher mates with a filthy swamp she-demon, spawning a creepy, cat-hanging psychopath who grows into a vicious killer and murders the old man, taking revenge for the very fact of his existence. And everyone in the whole book is guilty.Riveting stuff. And one of the greatest novels ever written. So why am I hearing beeps? Whispers? Giggles? Crinkling? A student pounds her phone. Someone leaps up in the middle of a sentence and rushes out of the room. One of the @#$% mini-folding arm desk-things snaps down with a bang and a splat. And if I walked around to the back, what would I see on your laptop screens? Sometimes students fall asleep (or maybe pass out — who can tell?). One semester, the student fell asleep every single class. I did back flips, told jokes, played video clips, upped the group work — everything I could think of to wake her up. At the end-of-semester celebration, over drinks and snacks, she told me she suffered from narcolepsy. Sometimes my students come to class bedraggled, hair every which way, still in their sleep pants. Sometimes they’re off-the-charts fancy (suit and tie, say, or cocktail dress and shiny designer shoes). Sometimes they even come in uniforms. I love this; it spices everything up and energizes our discussions. I’m thinking that the scruffy ones were up all night reading literary criticism. And the elegant ones dressed up to show their love for Dostoevsky. But I will never know what is really going on.

A sacrament of pause,Luke A. Powery,2024-03-18T04:00:00Z,Mar,18,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/031824-powery-sacrament-pause-20240318.html,"Coming out of spring break, I’m reminded of the gift of pause. Though many students and faculty may have been active over spring break, it is a time that offers relief from the normal routine. If you stayed on campus, it was much quieter and slower. The reduced buzz on campus was an example of a needed pause in life.I make a living from talking as a preacher and professor of preaching. One might think preachers are only talking heads, running their mouths all the time, but this isn’t the case. The first word in preaching or any oratorical act is silence because words come out of silence. This means the first task of a public speaker is to listen. The first rhetorical move is a ""hush,"" a pause.Even the great orator Martin Luther King Jr. took days of silence, according to historian Lewis Baldwin. As a proverb notes, ""A still tongue makes a wise head."" Wisdom can be found in silence.A major influence for King was Howard Thurman, who preached in Duke Chapel in 1979. If you listen to the recordings of those sermons, you will be struck by the long pauses Thurman takes. It’s no wonder that he had a spirituality that emphasized silence. In his book ""Meditations of the Heart,"" Thurman wrote:""How Good it is to center down! To sit quietly and see one’s self pass by!""Silence is built into human speech as Derek Nelson, associate professor of religion at Wabash College, explains:""The act of speaking itself is simply sound punctuated by silence, sound rendered intelligible by silence. Speaking is phoneme, pause, phoneme, pause, phoneme. Speaking without silence is incomprehensible. It would be like a typewriter whose carriage did not move with each new letter, so that every letter was struck on the same place on the paper.""Pause allows for a speaking that is without our speaking. It allows space for the other’s voice among our voices. Pause ensures that we do not fill up all of the acoustical air with our words. A pause allows for the potential of ""the music not heard with ears.""The pianist David Tudor leaned into this idea when he walked on stage at the Maverick Concert Hall, near Woodstock, New York, on Aug. 29, 1952. He sat down at the piano and — for four and a half minutes — made no sound. He performed ""4'33″,"" a conceptual work by musician John Cage. It’s been called the ""silent piece,"" but its purpose is to make people listen. Cage didn’t believe there was such a thing as silence because one could hear other sounds during that piece — the wind, raindrops, people talking or walking out. Many didn’t really care for this musical experiment, including his own mother. Performance expectations were not met on that day, but it may also be the case that people just have a hard time with silence because we may not like what we hear when we pause.In his book ""The Hum,"" Evans Crawford, a retired Howard University professor, takes it even further. He sees a connection between pauses in preaching and truth itself:""Sermon pause represents not only a rest from the sound of the preacher’s voice, but an opening in the preacher’s consciousness through which the musicality of the spirit breathes so that the musicality of the sermon resonates with the living truth.""Pauses in public speech make room for divine breath, the Presence in the pause. We pause to inhale divine life and exhale this life to others. This goes beyond human speech. There is what might be called, ""a sacrament of pause.""Silence — as uncomfortable as it can be — could be what we need in our TikTok society full of talking media heads. The pause could be a nuanced corrective to how we operate in the world. Rather than standing up and speaking up, maybe the next best wisest move is to sit down and listen to the music of silence.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel.

Homebound over hoopla: Why I'm ok with missing the Duke-UNC game,Barbara Cardenas,2024-03-08T18:48:00Z,Mar,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/030824-cardenas-20240308.html,"For three years running, I’ve missed the electrifying atmosphere of the Duke vs. UNC men’s basketball home game — a highlight for many on Duke’s campus, marking a pinnacle of school spirit. This annual basketball face-off is more than just a game; it’s a tradition steeped in rivalry, camaraderie and Blue Devil pride. Yet, as the fervor builds on campus, I am led elsewhere, back to my roots in Venezuela. This year, unlike the previous two, my decision to miss the game was made not with a sense of loss but with an overwhelming eagerness for the warmth of home. The choice to leave earlier than the game’s date was deliberate, driven by a deep longing to maximize my time at home — a journey that takes me a day and a half, navigating through flights and layovers that span continents.In my first year at Duke, the realization that I would miss the much-anticipated Duke vs. UNC game for spring break left me grappling with a sense of FOMO. The excitement on campus was palpable, the energy infectious. Friends and fellow students donned in Duke blue discussed game strategies, player stats and historic rivalries with a passion that could ignite the most indifferent of hearts. Social media was awash with anticipation, and here I was, about to embark on a long trip home, away from the epicenter of this annual collegiate ritual.That first time around was tough. It was Coach K’s last home Duke-UNC game and campus was going wild with anticipation. The atmosphere was electric, a once-in-a-lifetime event that was palpable even from miles away. And there I was, sitting in my living room, half a world away, tuning in with my parents. Yet, despite the initial sting of missing out, surrounded by family, I found a different joy in sharing this piece of my Duke life with them. We cheered and groaned together, turning what could have been a moment of sadness into a memorable bonding experience. By the end of the game, I had turned my parents into real Blue Devils, their enthusiasm for my university's spirit a testament to the infectious nature of Duke pride.The second year brought a similar sentiment: a tinge of regret at missing out on an experience so quintessential to the Duke identity. Conversations and plans swirled around me, a reminder of the communal joy and spirited unity I was leaving behind. Yet, even as I felt the tug of this campus tradition, the allure of home — of family, familiar streets and the comforting embrace of a community that has known me my entire life — began to weigh more significantly on my heart.This year, my decision to miss the Duke vs. UNC game came from a place of clarity and joy. The FOMO that once clouded my departure has dissipated, replaced by a profound appreciation for the opportunity to return to my roots. The excitement for the game, while still a vibrant part of campus life, no longer holds sway over my choices. The realization has dawned on me that the essence of college life isn't encapsulated by a single event, no matter how storied or celebrated. The decision to head home earlier this year was made with an eagerness that surprised even me. The longing for the familiar, for the embrace of family and the comfort of home, far outweighed the allure of any campus event.The travel back to Venezuela is long and, at times, arduous. It requires patience, as the excitement of returning home competes with the exhaustion of travel. Yet, each moment spent in transit is a reminder of the distances we traverse for the sake of connection and belonging. The anticipation of home, with its blend of warmth, love and familiarity, becomes all the more poignant with each passing mile. It's a testament to the strength of familial bonds and the deep-seated need for connection that transcends geographical barriers.Missing the Duke vs. UNC game for the third consecutive year has brought a sense of peace and perspective. It highlights the breadth of experiences that shape our college journey, reminding us that there’s a world beyond campus borders that calls for our attention and presence. Life on Duke’s campus, with its traditions, celebrations and collective moments of joy, is undeniably special. Yet, the pull of home, with its deep-rooted connections and personal histories, offers a different kind of fulfillment.This year, as I prepare to watch the game from thousands of miles away, surrounded by family, I do so with a heart full of gratitude. Gratitude for the opportunity to experience the richness of both worlds — the electric excitement of Duke and the comforting embrace of home. The game, while an iconic part of the Duke experience, is but a single thread in the rich tapestry of college life. It’s in the weaving together of these diverse experiences — of campus traditions and the warmth of home — that we find the true essence of our journey through these formative years. My choice to prioritize home is a reminder that sometimes, the greatest joy comes not from being part of the crowd but from embracing the paths that lead us back to where we belong.Despite the fulfillment and joy I’ve found in choosing home over the Duke vs. UNC game these past years, there’s a part of me that knows next year will be different. As my senior year approaches, the desire to fully immerse myself in every quintessential Duke experience grows stronger. The chance to stand among my peers, painted in Duke blue, cheering on our team against our storied rivals, is a rite of passage I realize I should not miss. It's not just about witnessing the game firsthand; it's about being part of the collective memory, the shared energy and the unity that only such an event can inspire. So, while I've cherished my decisions to prioritize home in the past, next year promises a shift. I plan to be there, in the heart of the excitement, not just for the sake of saying “I was there” but to fully embrace and contribute to the spirit and tradition that make Duke University uniquely vibrant. It will be a fitting culmination to my collegiate journey — a journey marked by learning, growth and the balance between embracing where I come from and diving into the experiences that define where I'm going.Barbara Cardenas is a Trinity junior.

Beyond the walls of fear,Paul Dilly,2024-03-08T05:00:00Z,Mar,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/030824-dilly-beyond-fear-20240308.html,"“O Captain! My Captain!” I cheered victoriously as John Keating’s students climbed onto their desks to (literally) stand in solidarity with him. Mr. Keating may have been fired — wrongly accused of instigating the death of a student — but he had left an indelible mark of courage on the young boys he had so vivaciously taught. As the end credits of “Dead Poets Society” rolled, I thought of college. In a few months, I would be leaving behind the comfort of my home and faced with the same choice as the boys from Welton Academy: I could either stick to the script I had clung to thus far — the assembly line of advanced classes and good grades and dozens of extracurriculars — or I could take inspiration from Keating and live freely, passionately, and accomplish amazing things all the while. Under the folds of my blankets, I felt no fear. I knew what I wanted, needed, to do. I channeled my inner Thoreau and vowed to go confidently in the direction of my dreams — and never look back. But courage in a quiet room carries an empty tune when brought before the cacophony of the world.As an incoming freshman, I had high expectations of Duke. I anticipated it would be as magical as its Hogwarts-style buildings felt, would give me the fresh start I so desired and simultaneously catapult me into the person I yearned to become. I couldn’t wait: a supercharged version of myself combined with the freedom to take any class, be part of any extracurricular, that I wanted? Yes, please! Instead of flying brooms and superpowers, however, I was met with the slap of stone-cold, muggle-infested reality. Sure, the campus was beautiful, the students were smart, the teachers were good, the classrooms were big. But as I waited for Duke to become the catalyst for my metamorphosis — to transform me into that confident and daring maverick I knew I could be — I was met with silence. My silver platter of personal evolution never came. I felt cheated out of a second chance. This was supposed to be my year to break out, to break away from the academic pipeline I’d been following blindly since middle school — and I resented Duke for it. In retaliation I decided to rebel, aiming to wreck any hope of Duke assisting me in finding my way. By doing what I’d always done: abandoning passion for a plan. Beneath the facade, I knew the only thing I was wrecking was me.As a prospective computer science and economics double major, I set my sights on marquee careers in marquee industries: investment banking in finance and software engineering in tech. I set off on these tracks in which (I believed) commitment brings near-guaranteed success, doing everything I was “supposed” to: join the preprofessional clubs, attend the meetings and workshops, get the certifications, learn the languages. All I had to do was follow the formula and hope it led me to one of the big names on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley. But it came with a cost.Such a staged lifestyle left no room for creativity or originality, morphing me into a walking algorithm. I no longer had to think or feel or choose; I just did, robotically pinballing along from one commitment to the next. I felt no stimulation, no purpose beyond the events and interviews that filled my days. It wasn’t that my heart wasn’t in it; my heart was numb to it. This life wasn’t mine. It didn’t help that I had already realized I had no interest in Wall Street. Tech was more appealing, but software engineering specifically did little to inspire me (what even is it?). Despite my disdain for this lifestyle I’d chosen, I felt it necessary to continue. Moving on meant relenting in my self-inflicted war with Duke, letting go of the one chance I had to spite the university that had trampled my hope to be more for myself. So I put my head down and trudged on.As the summer neared, I began applying to as many internships as I could, hoping there would be one lucky “You’re hired!” to come my way. But the days passed by with only rejection notices to keep me company. Somehow I knew the good news wouldn’t come. My interviewers could tell the sentiments expressed in my applications were full of empty words. I went home empty-handed, my foolproof plan failing me before I could begin.Away from the whirlwind of campus life, it was easy to see Duke was not the devil I had framed it to be. I had expected Duke to mold me into the version of myself I wanted to become, and I waited passively for that change to be realized. But it didn’t — how could it? Such change could only come from me, and I was too afraid to accept that. So instead I numbed my torment with denial. I made a scapegoat out of my tuition (a very expensive scapegoat…) and blamed Duke for my inability to change. I constructed a cage of expectations in which I could protect myself from the dangers of exploration — and consequently isolated myself from all the opportunity that came with it. I forced myself to pursue the carved-out paths to success, as I thought this was the only way I could ever make it. I told myself I was not smart enough, strong enough, courageous enough, to do it my way. I let fear pull me apart and stitch me into the image I wanted the world to see, because I was scared that being myself could somehow invalidate my accomplishments or knock me off the path to success. I conformed — and suffocated in the process — for the sake of playing it safe.We all struggle. Whether it be health issues, finances, expectations or the flaws of our university, there are so many things that threaten to restrict the opportunities before us. But our hardships themselves are not the problem; we must find a way to live with them, to summon our grit and fight on. Rather, the problem is allowing ourselves to live forthem. I often avoid doing the things I really want to do — such as tossing around a frisbee with friends or embarking on a spontaneous day trip to IKEA — because I’m afraid my poor health would detract from the joy of the moment. In rejecting these opportunities, however, I both eliminate any chance of enjoying myself and enable my situation to dictate my decisions. For your sake, do not make your struggles out to be bigger than they are; do not turn them into a makeshift shield of excuses to psych yourself out of doing what you need to do for yourself. Maybe you have to choose a certain major or pursue a specific type of internship because you need to make it out of here with a stable job in hand (as a member of a single-parent household in which the parent was just laid off their job, I feel you). Maybe you need to take three semesters of a foreign language or are otherwise bound to a schedule you don’t enjoy much. Despite all the burdens you carry, however, there are still ways in which you can discover pieces of yourself. There are pockets — little pockets of your time and energy and passion — that you can devote to something that is uniquely you, something you will enjoy so hard it won’t matter whether it benefits your career. Heck, I’m a computer science major writing for The Chronicle — it doesn’t make sense. But it doesn’t have to. Because it’s me. So, go ahead: find a desk to climb onto. Your worries and calculations and fears are too small for you up there. Envision the multiversal you that you aspire to be, and then take the leap. Who knows? Maybe you’ll spread your wings and surprise yourself with how far you fly.Paul Dilly is a Trinity sophomore. His column typically runs on alternate Thursdays."
The quiet crisis is upon us,Aaron Siegle,2024-03-08T05:00:00Z,Mar,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/030824-siegle-quiet-crisis-upon-us-20240308.html,"The phrase ""invasive species"" often conjures up images of 18-foot-long pythons prowling the Everglades or a pack of wild boar pillaging the forest. But invasive species exist all around us — many times in subtler but more pervasive forms. From the House Sparrows that fly overhead to the English Ivy that adorns our buildings, invasive species quietly choke our landscape.Last week was National Invasive Species Awareness Week, a nationwide effort to better understand the ways we can better protect our native environment that is under siege from so many fronts. Invasive species are plants and animals unnaturally introduced to an ecosystem by humans — an inevitable product of today’s globalized economy. While introducing a species to a new region may not necessarily be bad, the problems start when invasive species begin to outcompete native species for habitat and prey. Left unchecked by natural predators from their natural habitat, invasive species use this advantage to drive native species to the brink of extinction. It’s no surprise then that 42% of species are endangered due to increased competition from invasive species. Unique ecological relationships developed over a millennium can be broken apart by just one problematic species.Duke is uniquely positioned to address the challenges posed by invasive species given its status as one of the premier research universities in the South, a region that has been particularly hit hard by invasive species. Duke can fuse its Southeastern roots with its global network to address a problem that transcends academic disciplines and international boundaries. Perhaps more tangibly, Duke should update its landscaping choices to better highlight plants native to North Carolina and to reduce the risk of invasive species escaping into the wild.With so much attention given to mitigating climate change, addressing biodiversity loss is often put on the back burner of the political agenda. For context, around 85,000 people attended COP28, the global climate change conference, while only 18,000 attended the United Nations Biodiversity Conference in Montreal, the most recent global conference seeking to address our precipitous loss of biodiversity.Unfortunately, Duke’s actions mirror this disconnect. The Duke Climate Commitment is backed with an initial $36 million in donations, while the university refused to work with willing donors to keep the Duke Herbarium open. Herbaria are critical bulwarks of biodiversity, serving as a backup plan in case a species is completely eliminated by invasive species. Additionally, species in the Duke Herbarium can serve as a useful baseline to study how native plants adapt over time to invasive species and other environmental stressors.While climate change should still be of utmost concern, a net-zero future is not enough to restore ecological balance to our planet. Making the Earth whole is like fixing a car with a broken engine and a flat tire. You can replace the tire, but this will be futile unless the engine is fixed as well. In the same way, we can achieve a net-zero emissions future, but this will be in vain unless we simultaneously solve the biodiversity crisis.Why is this so?The existential threat faced by biodiversity loss is more difficult to visualize than that of climate change, but that does not mean it is any less important. Biodiversity provides ecosystem services, which are basic environmental functions, such as nutrient cycling that make life on Earth possible. For example, even large agricultural corporations still rely on bees to pollinate their crops. But as more species of native bees become threatened by invasive species, pesticides and pathogens, this ecosystem service we often take for granted is no longer guaranteed. Despite the complexity of our modern agricultural system, we are still reliant on natural pollinators like bees to feed eight billion people.Invasive species also exact a heavy toll on our economy. Zebra Mussels, native to the Caspian and Black Seas, likely hitched a ride to the U.S. on ships. Once here, these unassuming mussels have rapidly expanded throughout the Eastern US. Their abundance clogs up intake pipes at power plants, costing the energy sector over $5,000 per hour. And this is only a small portion of the $21 billion that invasive species cost the U.S. economy every year.So, what can we do about invasive species?First, we must urge Duke to make campus a more friendly place for the native species under threat. Organizations like Bee Campus USA work to make campuses more pollinator friendly and pesticide-free. Despite both our Research Triangle-rivals NC State and UNC joining the bee campus network, Duke is still not a member. Encouraging Duke to join this nationwide movement to protect pollinators would be a step in the right direction.Second, our individual actions really do make a difference in conserving biodiversity. Making the simple choice to replace your lawn with native plants makes a tangible impact on the local ecosystem. Depending on where you live, it may qualify you for some government rebates as well.Finally, we must look at nature with a more critical eye to better understand how our actions have reshaped nature. Those ""rare"" deer you see behind Edens are probably only there because we eliminated apex predators, such as panthers and red wolves. Becoming more familiar with our local environment is the first step toward repairing our environment.Even if we seldom encounter nature in our day-to-day lives, let us remember how utterly dependent we are on it. If we neglect mother nature, we diminish her ability to protect us too.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity sophomore. His column typically runs on alternate Fridays."
What if our school work actually mattered?,Aaron Price,2024-03-07T05:00:00Z,Mar,7,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/030724-price-school-work-mattered-20240307.html,"You know that feeling when you work really hard on an assignment? You stay up late and wake up early. You diligently spend hours in the Gothic Reading Room reading and re-reading your writing, checking the logic of your algorithm or crafting that perfectly persuasive memo. And then you submit it and get a grade back. It’s an “A” and you’re stoked. Then the high wears off. You take back the paper and you admire the grade one last time. Then, you throw it in the trash or never open the document tab again.This is how school works. Since kindergarten, we have poured hours into completing assignments to develop as learners. But, once those assignments are finished, they’re never touched again. Hundreds if not thousands of essays, math sheets and coding projects all destined for the physical or digital trash. That’s school. But, what if it doesn’t have to be?What if our assignments were destined not for the landfill but for use by our local community? This would be wildly beneficial to students, community members and the relationship between Duke and Durham. I realize this isn’t possible in every class — but what if we at least considered it as we designed syllabi?We are already doing this in some classes. In EGR101, companies and organizations pitch different engineering challenges they are facing. The students, mainly freshmen, then spend the semester moving through the engineering design process to create solutions.The Duke Club Ski and Snowboard Team was one of the organizations pitching a project last semester. With our lack of snow in Durham, the team didn’t have the ability to train without traveling. So, an EGR101 team built a portable and artificial ski slope for them. The student engineers got to work with real users and the skiers ended up receiving a product that enables them to practice their sport on campus. A true win-win.Real work doesn’t have to be limited to EGR101. Marketing classes could help local businesses with their branding, computer science students could design software to automate tedious workflows for non-profits and journalism students could share the stories and history of Durham through their coursework.Duke students would get the chance to feel more connected to their assignments. There’s nothing more special than working diligently on something and then seeing it being used in the world. We would develop portfolios of real projects and get to work with real stakeholders — with all of the nuance, feedback and learning that comes from that.Durham would get the extra hands and expertise of Duke students, saving them time and money while increasing the impact they are able to have. Many of these local nonprofits and organizations can’t afford to spend tens of thousands of dollars on a new website, don’t have the bandwidth to explore new opportunities or can’t access Duke’s resources to be on top of cutting-edge research. Duke students serving their communities through their classwork would unlock these opportunities for them.And this would all serve to strengthen the bond between Duke and Durham in a way where students are supporting the community rather than just venturing into the city to play. This would spark dialogue and understanding between Duke and Durham and align with the goals of the Board of Trustees Strategic Task Force.I recognize that initiating this real world work would require significant time and resources to build relationships with partner organizations. But, I think the benefits to students, Durham and the relationship between the university and community outweigh the costs.Students at Duke try really hard. I hope we start to recognize the missed opportunity of not applying our learning through real work. I hope we stop throwing away our hours of grinding and that we recognize schoolwork can serve student development and our community at the same time. Duke has the chance to empower students through solving real problems, help our Durham community and strengthen the relationship between our school and the city. I really hope we decide to take it.Aaron Price is a Trinity senior. His column typically runs on alternate Tuesdays."
"A love letter to our cool, queer universe",Nik Narain,2024-03-07T05:00:00Z,Mar,7,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/030724-narain-queer-universe-love-letter-20240307.html,"When you learned physics in high school, you probably learned classical physics — a system of calculus-based relations and rules that are used to model several real-world situations, such as collisions, friction, circuits and the dreaded block on an inclined plane. Perhaps you fell in love with the subject for its ability to deeply and elegantly explain the natural world and chose to continue studying the field — be it academically or on your own time.Eventually, you may reach a point where you’re instructed to temporarily forget about the classical view and now learn quantum physics, where suddenly things you didn’t think were abstractions become abstractions, some properties are fixed yet others can exist in infinite states, everything is highly discretized yet highly spectral, and everything has uncertainty built into it. You’re sucked into this world of confusion, unpredictability and adaptability, and you're given the daunting task of modeling such chaos.This is not to say that classical physics is wrong. After all, principles of classical physics govern the majority of modern technology and infrastructure. But we now know that this view only models a certain portion of the world, and only at a more macroscopic level. As we approach a deeper level, we start to see an entirely new set of rules surface, and these rules seem to currently be the most successful understanding of our world with growing prominence in many modern inventions and innovations.What I’m hoping to do here is draw a rough parallel between the ways we’ve historically thought about science and the ways we’re currently thinking about ourselves. In the above paragraphs, if you replace the “physics” narrative with “sexuality,” “gender” or other “identity” words, perhaps you might have had a similar experience of having a certain worldview challenged (even shattered) and struggling to find some semblance of individual “truth” or “knowledge” in a sea of perplexing and sometimes contradictory information. I chose to demonstrate this relation between science and queerness with physics in particular because the drastic shift from classical to quantum physics was historically ripe with conflict, and physics taps into something deeply fundamental and fearfully unifying. A similar case can be made in several fields of science that have undergone their own revelations and evolutions (sometimes about evolution itself). This is not to say that science “explains” social identity; science is incredibly far from revealing anything about personhood with the level of profundity we desire. Nevertheless, I think there's beauty in the universality of how scientific and social theories work have shifted toward models rooted in “fuzziness”, uncertainty and plurality, and that beauty needs to be named. The closer we get to accurately modeling the natural world, the more confusing and expansive our models become. The more adaptive our language around how we describe those models becomes, the more critical language itself becomes to preserving a model’s integrity, whether that language is rooted in mathematics or prose. The more intense our debates become about a model’s validity due to its far-reaching implications outside the sciences or the humanities.Seeking to articulate the connection between the scientific process and queer existences isn’t new (Harvard even has an entire department dedicated to the subject). The most notable example of this is the acclaimed theoretical physicist and feminist theorist Karen Barad’s theory of agential realism. This theory rejects the notion of matter as “fixed,” instead defining it as a series of ongoing “intra-actions” (Barad’s term for interactions). In this way, Barad calls attention to not only the adaptive nature of the quantum world, but the fluidity of gender dynamics, and how our identities are highly shaped by our interactions with the world. While this philosophy has shared its course of debate, agential realism has served as a major tool in both gender education and particle physics.On a less academic level, a few people have also looked to connect ideas from physics with their personal identity journeys, such as physicists Chanda Prescod Weinstein and Jessica Esquivel and queer activist Amrou Al-Kadhi. They make similar connections to how the “strange” ways we’ve been thinking about the quantum world have mimicked their own “strange” ways of finding their place in it. They make novel connections and abstractions to these seemingly disparate disciplines — like how the dismantling of binary in quantum computing parallels gender nonconformity, or how concepts like duality and superposition parallels a more fluid view of sexuality. Unsurprisingly, the comment sections of many of these works are riddled with hate speech asserting that this identity connection to science is “corrupt” and even “narcissistic.” While some of the connections these speakers make can be abstract, I think it’s made very clear in these works that the point of this kind of language isn’t to help you study for a physics exam but to gain an appreciation of scientific practice and potentially draw connections between distant concepts and real-world experiences. With metaphor being one of the first-line defenses for science communication, is it so “corrupt” to build metaphors from lived experience, accepting that those comparisons aren’t obviously perfect and being continually improved upon? If science is the most epic narrative of who we are, how things work and how we got here, what’s more beautiful than connecting your own story within that narrative — especially if it not only helps you remember science but also celebrate it? Light can be both a particle and a wave. Particles decay into new particles into newer particles every second until reaching a point of stability. The electromagnetic spectrum is vast and the only portion visible to us happens to be the rainbow (coincidence? I think not). And there’s a cat with questionable mortality! The more we learn about the world around us, the more we realize a universe that, like the late mathematical biologist J. B.S. Haldane once wrote, “is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.” Maybe to call all of these scientific phenomena “queer” is unsettling; maybe it’s even misinformative. Maybe a better word for it will come in the next decade. Maybe we’ll have to overhaul the entirety of physics, biology, chemistry or gender — yet again. At least for now, I think drawing connections between scientific and identity-centric disciplines is really cool, and enriches our framework for how we view the microscopic worlds that ultimately make us us. If anything, perhaps reconciling with the inherent chaos of our queer universe can provide some sense of comfort in navigating the internal chaos of our own personhood.Nik Narain is a Trinity junior.

QuadEx could be great. Here’s how (Part II) ,Nicholas Chrapliwy,2024-03-06T12:53:00Z,Mar,6,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/030624-chrapliwy-quadex-part-two-20240306.html,"In my last column about QuadEx, I wrote about how Duke’s attempt at housing reform could mature into the most positively transformative feature of Duke’s community if it implemented a coherent model around the fundamental core of shared spaces. The tree ring model of concentric layers to community growth provides a coherent vision for how QuadEx could become a beloved and admired feature of Duke, but there is another facet that will be crucial to its success, and which deserves its own treatment: the cultivation of a middle scale of housing community.Between the smallest scale of roommates and the largest scale of the whole 250-to-500-person Quad, there is a fundamental need for a scale of community that is structured around the natural social niche of thirty to sixty people for QuadEx to be successful at building and sustaining real communities within the model. Duke and QuadEx don’t currently appear to have a plan for this scale of community, although it existed for years in Greek life sections on campus, SLG sections and independent houses under older models of housing. It’s also true that QuadEx has several seemingly intractable problems with its implementation, including the inefficacy of Quad Councils, failure to fully incorporate LLCs and SLGs into the model, and a failure to follow through on its original mission of building continuous communities from East to West and beyond. All of these problems and more are resolved by the addition to the model of a middle scale of housing community. But what would this scale look like within the existing QuadEx design, and how would it solve the problems that the current model for QuadEx cannot? To give you the clearest idea of the answer to these questions, I’ll describe a student’s journey through their middle scale community at Duke. For clarity I’ll call the middle scale community group a ‘Hall’ to distinguish it from a House or a Quad. These communities could be called anything, but ‘Hall’ implies their core spatial component and scale while avoiding associations with other community group names already in use. The spatial component is the most pressingly important to develop — the core of the tree ring model is shared space, which is located so centrally because all of the components surrounding it will fail to thrive in its absence. To begin describing a potential Duke student’s journey through a QuadEx with Halls, let’s start with Hannah, who enrolls at a hypothetical Duke where Halls have been part of QuadEx from the beginning. She starts her first semester in her East Campus House, Brown, enjoying the convenient location right next to Marketplace. She makes friends with people on her floor, and even more friends with her sister House, Alspaugh, because she’s earned a few points for the Quad Cup with them since they both compete for their linked Quad, Kilgo. That’s how she met her core friend group, made up of people on her floor and a few others in Brown and Alspaugh. They all grew especially close by spending time together in their common room late at night while finishing homework. Hannah comes back from winter break to the spring of her first year, and pretty soon everyone is getting ready to choose their housing for the coming fall as sophomores. Hannah knows that as part of QuadEx she’ll be in Kilgo, but the Quad has a few hundred people, and she only knows a fraction of them. So she and her friends from Brown and Alspaugh rush Magnolia Hall, which is the set of rooms in Kilgo section I through L on the first and second floors. She knows that she’s guaranteed to get into a Hall, and that with it comes the community of the three or four dozen people she’ll be physically closest to. Once rush is over, the upperclassmen of Magnolia Hall hand over the reins and show Hannah and all her friends the ins and outs of their space, as well as some of the Hall traditions they’ll keep going in the coming year like Open Door Day, where you get to see all the rooms in the Hall. The upperclassmen will still be connected to the community they’ve built since they’ll move into Magnolia Hall’s section in Swift in the fall. Hannah and her Hallmates have an election before the Spring semester is over to decide who will be their Hall representative to the Quad Council, made up of representatives of all the Halls coming together. She wins by ten votes. Hannah has a friend, Mihir, who lived in Pegram House, and rushed the Spire Fellows LLC for his sophomore year. That means his Hall is Spire Hall in Craven, which has a section in Hollows for when he comes back from his Junior Fall abroad next year. The LLC does many activities together, and Mihir’s Hall representative on the Quad Council makes sure they have the portion of the Quad Council budget they need to do everything from hosting a visiting professor to having more than enough pizza at their Super Bowl party. Mihir’s friend Sophia had an older sibling at Duke who was in Mirecourt when the SLG still had a section on campus. Since the SLGs were reincorporated into the QuadEx model as Halls, she knew she wanted to rush Mirecourt Hall with her friends moving from Giles House into Crowell Quad. She had a friend who lived in Randolph but mostly hung out with people in Giles, so that friend rushed Mirecourt Hall too, and they were able to switch their Quad affiliation going into their sophomore fall. Every spring, there’s a Mirecourt All Hall party in their section where the newest members of each Hall get to meet the seniors who used to live there. Some years they even have alumni return. In her junior year, Sophia started working in a lab she learned about from someone she met at the All Hall Party. In their senior year, Hannah, Mihir, and Sophia all returned to their Hall sections frequently for events and to connect with new members after the Spring rush. They loved teaching their first years about the Hall traditions and identities, and how each Hall identity possesses a component of the Quad Identity, like Kilgo’s Magnolia tree or Craven’s Raven. Hannah helped a first year student run to represent their Hall in the Quad Council. Mihir told someone where to order the best pizza for their Super Bowl party next year. And Sophia, who had just finished her distinction project in the lab she joined sophomore year, connected an interested first year student to her lab manager. The details of these three cases — independent Halls, LLC Halls and SLG Halls — could easily be as vastly different as Duke students themselves are. But they illustrate how a middle scale of community could exist in a way that solves some of QuadEx’s weakest points. Every Duke student joins a Hall by selection from the bottom up or by default, because the model is exhaustive: Every room in the Quad is part of a three to five dozen block of physically adjacent rooms, building in a ground floor of belonging that doesn’t let students slip through the cracks of community structure as many do in QuadEx’s current design. There would be one resident assistant associated with each Hall, reinforcing the RA’s current efforts to build community while eliminating those efforts that are redundant with the Quad Council’s. First among the problems a middle scale could solve for QuadEx is the fact that LLCs and SLGs could be woven into the framework without missing a thread, providing the same living-learning structure and community structure that these groups aspired to before QuadEx. It would even be possible to incorporate Greek life sections this way, although the likelihood of that ever happening seems low. However, the point stands that pre-QuadEx forms of middle scale communities could be seamlessly blended into the new model and preserve the richness those communities contribute to Duke overall, but only if we adopted a middle scale of housing community. In the current model, these groups are absent, detached or obliquely incorporated into their Quad’s community. Secondly, the Quad Councils currently have considerable budgets, but sometimes poor engagement by the council members themselves and by the students at the events they organize. This is due to a variety of factors, but a significant one is that the Councils are composed of members who have no specific charge from any student or group of students, leaving their mandate and purpose for governing weak and unstructured. If the Councils were composed of representatives from each Hall — who are answerable to their Hallmates for the state of things, and who can confidently organize events they know their Hallmates will attend — the Councils would necessarily behave differently. Thirdly, the place-based continuity that has the potential to exist from East Houses to West Quads accounts for only half of the time students matriculate at Duke — a middle scale community of Halls would exist not just in the Quads, but for juniors and seniors when they live in Hollows and Swift as well. QuadEx is well-known for attempting to remove selectivity from the housing process at great cost, but selectivity doesn’t have to happen from only the top-down direction. First-year students can select into their Halls from the bottom up through combined blocking and other means, letting them experience the benefits of that scale of intentional and equitable community. Making QuadEx into the exceptional and beloved way we do housing at Duke will take many years of growth and investment, but it will also require creative leadership that innovates to bolster the weak spots of the model when they become apparent. A great arborist knows when to prune a tree’s branches and when to graft in new ones, and for QuadEx to mature and thrive, it’s going to need some creative modifications. The middle scale of housing communities should be the first one.

The case for adding a Middle East and North African Studies pathway to the AMES major,"Mariam Gulamhusein, Eleanor Ross",2024-03-06T05:00:00Z,Mar,6,Letters To The Editor,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/030624-gulamhusein-ross-mena-studies-ames-major-20240306.html,"Duke’s AMES (Asian and Middle East) department is broken. Our university has neglected a major providing a catch-all for over 60% of the world’s population, multiple continents and countless ethnicities — all in the name of what? Censorship concerns? Funding constraints? Fear of ___ (please, admin, fill in the blank)?As two AMES majors, we have noticed time and time again how the major’s overarching framework sidelines the Middle East and North Africa’s (MENA) cross-section of language, history, and culture. Especially in today’s political environment, the intersection of Africa and Arabia is more important than ever. So, we propose a new pathway within the AMES department: MENA Studies.AMES majors are offered three regional pathways: the Middle East, East Asia, and the Indian Subcontinent. However, the choices for North Africa classes are slim pickings, and the department makes it unclear that these courses are included in the Middle East pathway. Classes are highly dependent on individual faculty members who — although we love them — are not given adequate resources or manpower to address the MENA. For many Duke students, the only way to learn about North Africa is through study abroad opportunities. Duke in the Arab World is an opportunity for Blue Devils to study citizenship and government structures in North Africa, but what happens when these students return to their dorms?Current events have only exacerbated this issue with the administration viewing AMES offerings and Islamic Studies courses as institutional liabilities. Yet, this approach is counterintuitive: How can Duke foster educated conversations on the Middle East when it won’t provide students the academic background to do so? Duke cannot and will not serve its educational mission if it continues to discipline this discipline.We’re asking Duke to fill a gap that it has left largely unaddressed. While we know that implementing a MENA pathway won’t fix the structural and cultural problems that plague Duke’s AMES department, it’s definitely a start.Mariam Gulamhusein is a Trinity sophomore, and Eleanor Ross is a Trinity senior."
Better one safe way,Anna Garziera,2024-03-06T05:00:00Z,Mar,6,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/030624-garziera-better-one-safe-way-20240306.html,"Sometimes, when I feel overwhelmed, I look to the teachers of the past for sound advice. Last Sunday night, I chose Aesop, whose fables shaped my childhood. The copy I read had all the classics, like “The Hare and the Tortoise,” “The Lion and the Mouse” and “The Goose and the Golden Eggs,” as well as some lesser known stories.After some browsing, I landed on “The Cat and the Fox.” In this story, the two characters are walking in the woods. The Fox boasts about his numerous plans of escape, while the Cat has only one. But when a pack of hounds attacks, the Cat seeks refuge in a tree, while the Fox, unable to carry out his strategies, is torn to pieces. I like two things about Aesop’s stories: firstly, he titled each of his 725 fables so efficiently. I only have to say “The Hare and the Grasshopper” for you to know exactly which fable I am talking about. Secondly, in just one or two pages, he conveys as much meaning as any contemporary novel. Talk about conciseness. If two pages is still too long for you, don’t fret — just read the last line.While it isn’t often that we find ourselves being chased by a pack of hounds, his advice is still relevant today: “Better one safe way than a hundred on which you cannot depend.”With the rise of the internet, learning new things is easier than ever. Back in the day, people predominantly learned from their parents and their peers. Perhaps, if they needed additional mentorship, they looked to their teachers and priests. Now, advice is all over the web. Yet whether or not it is sound is highly questionable.Now, people give advice on things they know nothing about, to people that didn’t even ask. We see this with forums such as Quora and Reddit, with comments under videos and posts and — in a sense — with the videos and posts themselves. While I too am guilty of falling into a few Reddit rabbit holes, too much is just too much.A significant part of the problem is that we are force-fed advice that is constantly changing. From fitness advice to relationship advice to college admissions advice, advice-givers cannot agree. Influencers come up with a different “hot new thing” every month. Some topics are more susceptible to developing trends than others. However, the underlying motivation is clear: Advice-givers are either trying to grow their fan base or their wallet.Some influencers don’t try to hide it; the trend of hustle bro culture is alive and growing. After dabbling on sharing their financial advice, these astute businessmen offer their services, which come in the forms of online courses or counseling sessions. Others are more subtle. For instance, fitness influencers often “swear by” a certain brand of protein powder that they just so happen to be sponsored by. When these marketing geniuses offer “advice” in order to sell something, this might lead to consumers overpaying for a mediocre product. However, content creators sometimes share advice to create controversy or with malicious intent. This can get problematic: Their young and impressionable audiences might actually decide to follow their guidance.With all things, there is a corner on the internet reserved for higher education. From productivity tips to move-in day essentials to pointers on how to “beat” college admissions, the list never ends. And the content never stops being created. You’d think there were enough college admissions reaction videos out there to quench every high school senior’s thirst, and yet every year, a new wave of them rolls out. We watch these videos like we used to watch Dora the Explorer. Every episode is pretty much the same and yet we still ate up every single one.A surprising number of Dukies admit to having watched “How to get into Duke” videos before applying. Whether or not these videos helped us be admitted is hard to tell. Current Duke students, alumni and admission officers tell viewers to both have “talent and the inclination to use it,” which seems harmless enough. However, there are hidden costs to watching college admissions advice. Firstly, it feels productive. Listening to advice about how to do something feels like doing the thing itself. In reality, it uses up a lot of time, which some procrastinators could have used to start their “Why Duke?” essay. Secondly, it leads to disappointment. No matter how many advice videos one watches, how many blogs one reads, acceptance into any one college is not guaranteed. There are hundreds of videos on Youtube about “How to get into Harvard” and even more videos of students opening their admission letter. However, Harvard tries to make it clear to their applicants that being admitted is not so straightforward.Indeed, almost nothing in life is straightforward. Most outcomes are a combination of inputs, some which we can control, some which we can’t. Then, losing brain cells trying to find the perfect solution to a problem is futile. Even if we followed every piece of advice out there, we still would, on occasion, fail. And probably go mad in the process.In that case, we would be much better off with only one strategy that is tried and true, leaving the rest up to chance. This has very practical implications, like getting healthy, for instance. We could spend years trying all the different workouts and diets available on the internet and inevitably find that the real “ultimate” strategy is not a specific workout or diet, but consistency.If you’ve had stage fright, you’ve probably tried to picture everybody naked. If you’ve lacked self-confidence, you’ve probably tried to say nice things to your reflection in the mirror. If you’ve felt unproductive, you’ve probably color-blocked your entire google calendar; you now have tasks lined up to last you until the end of 2025. There is enough advice out there to try everything once and then never have to use it again. Like the Fox, we have a hundred strategies that “might work” up our sleeve. We are wary of the Cat, because having only one strategy feels risky. What if it should fail us?This applies to many aspects of life. Having no backups feels scary. Yet, having too many backups can take away from the main strategy — the one that might actually work. For instance, we tend to want a large group of friends, forgetting that perhaps having only a few friends that we can rely on is enough. In fact, having only a few friends would allow us to put more time and energy into each friendship.Then, the goal isn’t to try every possible solution, nor to have a hundred backup plans. The goal is to have a handful of strategies that we can rely on. Concentrating our solutions will give us practice using each strategy as well as some mental clarity. In a world that continuously tells us that there is a better way, it is difficult not to turn our heads. However, we can begin to realize that we don’t need all the advice the world has to offer. Sometimes, we only need to know how to climb a tree.Anna Garziera is a Trinity first-year. Her column typically runs on alternate Wednesdays."
Should the Duke Chapel call the adhan? ,"Yi-Chyun Wong, Erin Dickerson",2024-03-05T09:00:00Z,Mar,5,Letters To The Editor,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/030524-dickerson-wong-chapel-adhan-20240305.html,"The adhan, or the call to prayer, is an important reminder called from the minarets of mosques for Muslims to congregate and perform their prayers. However, should calls to prayer be reserved for their respective religious buildings? Looking at the Hagia Sophia, the function of the building determines if there are any calls to prayer. In 2020, the Hagia Sophia called the adhan for the first time after 86 years of silence as a museum. It was only when the Hagia Sophia started functioning as a mosque that it began calling the adhan. Similarly, an actively functioning Christian church calling the Muslim adhan confuses the purpose of the church. The request for a church to function as a mosque disagrees with its purpose, and vice versa. In choosing to not call the adhan, is the Duke Chapel excluding the Muslim community? The word “exclude” has become blacklisted in modern vernacular, however, it is the crux to creating a community. The definition of a community relies on sharing an identity, experience, ideology, and so on, so anyone who does not share them would be excluded from the community. This is not inherently evil; instead, it is a beautiful demonstration of diversity. There is no attack or fear of the Muslim community in not calling the adhan from the Chapel; it is instead respecting its function as a Christian place of worship and refraining from encroaching on the functions of a mosque. Still, even if not from the Duke Chapel, hearing the adhan for Muslims on campus is an important reminder for them to take a moment from worldly stresses and refocus on spiritual blessings and praise. Therefore, just as Christians on campus hear the church bells on Sundays from the Chapel, Muslims should receive the call to prayer from their place of worship during Ramadan to denote sunset and the breaking of their daily fast. This would be a meaningful gesture for Duke and Muslims on campus during this month of fasting, reflection and community.Erin Dickerson is a Trinity sophomore, and Yi-Chyun Wong is a Pratt junior."
What your major says about you,Alex Berkman,2024-03-05T05:00:00Z,Mar,5,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/030524-berkman-major-says-about-you-20240305.html,"For most freshmen looking to make friends, “what’s your major” is a perfectly reliable conversation starter. Looking back on it, subsequent conversation normally did not extend beyond “math"" and “okay, cool”, and that is fine — although it can be a slight buzz kill when someone wants to explain linear algebra at a night out. In my case, I used the “what’s your major” question not as a way to make friends but rather to determine who I did not want to be friends with. Have I already mentioned that I am a bit of a prick? Of note, I did not discriminate against specific majors, but rather against those who acted like they had a single idea of what they wanted to do with their lives. “Oh, thanks for asking, chief. I’m planning on double majoring in computer science and physics, with a minor in philosophy and a certificate in markets & management.”Ya, pass. I can confidently say that this was not the response of any of my current friends. Their responses likely more closely resembled:“To be honest I have no clue. I’m just trying to get drunk tonight.” There is a correlation — albeit a loose one — between one’s personality and major. But for this article’s sake, let’s pretend like everyone of the same major has the same personality. Prepare to be insulted. In the end, this is all in good fun. EconomicsStarting off with everyone’s favorite trust fund baby, we have economics majors. Often, they can be found partaking in a coffee chat at Saladelia, where they have perfected the art of brown-nosing. “The ends truly justify the means” for this crowd, willing to sacrifice both their time and dignity for the paycheck and prestige. Hey, I can’t blame them. There’s nothing wrong with wanting a second crib by the ripe age of 25. It is likely they will tell you how passionate they are about investment banking, but don’t let them fool you. These students are always in interview-mode. Truth is, they likely have already begun planning their exit into private equity five years out. They “summer” in the Hamptons and “winter” in Aspen. They go to Duke basketball games but never in the lowly student section. And why would they when Daddy can get them into the Champion’s Club? I will give them credit: this crew does know how to party, as they comprise what seems to be half of Greek life. Political Science/Public PolicyI lump political science and public policy together because they both can be divided into two classes of individuals: future lawyers and former economics majors. The latter group likely switched over once they realized that (i) economics is not a cake walk and (ii) that as long as you interview well, recruiters do not care if you are an economics, political science or even a theater major. With their light course load yet equivalent internships attained, this group truly embodies the saying “work smarter, not harder.” Of importance, they are great people to have as friends. They are as fun as the economics group, but are certainly more down to earth, largely because they acknowledge that their future Nantucket home will likely not be beachfront — unlike their economics counterparts. Pre-MedFor pre-med kids, college is an opportunity to boost their future medical school application. Thus, they involve themselves in countless activities on campus — most of which they do not have any genuine care for. From research to volunteering, to undergraduate pre-med societies started by former pre-med students to help themselves get into medical school, this group truly does it all. Wait until they find out that this could all be for nothing if they do poorly on the MCAT. Uh oh ... was I not supposed to say that?Now, I will give them credit. This crew has opted into a rigorous academic pathway and not seeing a paycheck before 30 simply because they are dedicated to helping others. That in itself is incredibly honorable. Now, whether this is because they are truly a good person or because their parents will disown them if they don’t become a doctor is besides the point.Good on you, pre-med students. It will all be worth it in the end. Maybe …Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies (GSF)Now, of course, I recognize the irony in that this comes from a cisgender, straight, white male. Sorry, what I meant to say is that “I am a cis, straight, white male, and I use he/him pronouns.” And admittedly, I had been advised by peers to abstain from addressing this group out of fear of what some may call “cancellation.” But I am sorry to say that no major is safe from my critique. GSF majors most certainly have incredible hearts, often concerning themselves with the correction of historical wrongs, uplifting those who have been mistreated, and the overall future of humanity. But for god’s sake, they are also the last group of people I would ever want to grab a beer with. Though, it’s not like they would have time to grab a drink anyway. Their Saturday nights are already pre-booked by a 20-person protest against the endangerment of the Fluffy-Backed Tit-Babbler (a rare bird species indigenous to Southeast Asia). Or was it rather the installment of an oil pipeline in Alaska? I may be getting my dates confused. Their track record for taking a joke is certainly not among the best. So I hope they have all woken up on the right side of the bed on this beautiful morning. HistoryFirst, if I may make but one assumption — you, whoever I am writing to, is most certainly a dude. You have a love of movies, but specifically all things Christopher Nolan, and your favorite historical figure is without question Genghis Khan. You will go down a five hour wormhole on a Tuesday, learning about the practices of gladiatorship in Ancient Rome. Yet, you somehow do not have the time to take 30 seconds to make your own bed or do your laundry. Get it together y’all. What I do admire about you is that your reason for selecting this major is solely due to your infatuation with history. After all, it is most certainly not the career prospects that are offered. We all know these are limited. But this is okay because in the end, you too will likely become a history professor, where you will make it your mission to ensure that your students do not make the same mistake of becoming a history major as well.After all, “Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.” You’d know something about that, right? EngineeringOf the engineers, we have those who actually want to be engineers and those who endure four years of Pratt only to go into finance, tech or medicine. You may make fun of public policy and political science majors for their “light” course load; however, it appears they may be the smarter ones after all. Because while you are studying for your higher level physics exam, they are playing spikeball on the quad. And all for the same job opportunities. WOMP. WOMP. There is a subconscious superiority complex at play here, in recognizing that the Pratt acceptance rate is slightly lower than Trinity’s. But humble yourselves, Pratt Stars. University of Colorado at Boulder has a higher ranked engineering program than Duke, and I can assure you that they are doing a lot more with their free time than studying. I must give you credit though: I initially had thought of Pratt students as some type of foreign species, incapable of integrating into the populace. But it turns out that you guys are actually more normal and less interesting than I would have thought. Interpret that how you will. Love, Alex. My majorFirst, I apologize to those whose majors have been omitted from this piece. As I think you may have realized though, perhaps you were the lucky ones after all. However, I am a fair person. Therefore, I think it only appropriate that I now rip into myself after ripping into all of you. So, let’s get into it. I am a biology major, but no, I am not pre-med. So, yes, my decision to take organic chemistry was a personal choice. What a nerd, right? I tell people that I want to be a biotech entrepreneur, but truthfully, I do not have a single clue what that means. My current plan is to pursue a Ph.D., where I, an admitted extrovert, will spend five years cooped up in a lab, in which my closest friends will be the fruit flies and mice I am experimenting on. Perfect.I will likely work in pharmaceuticals for some time before I realize how difficult it is to make money in this space. And at some point, I too will end up selling my soul to capitalism and enter the world of finance, where my former peers — the brown-nosers and all — will likely serve as my superiors. That may be a tough pill to swallow. So, truthfully I have no clue what my career path will look like. And unless you are one of the insufferable people I met during O-week, you likely do not either. And that is perfectly okay. For all I know, an economics major may go on to become a playwright. A history major may preside at the top of BlackRock. Perhaps a Pratt student becomes the next president (though I doubt this given their lack of personal skills). KIDDING. Kinda …My point is that despite everything I have said in this piece, our majors do NOT define us, nor do they place barriers on what we can and cannot achieve in the future.

Duke-Durham dividers: East Campus walkways to be replaced with a moat ,Monday Monday,2024-03-04T05:00:00Z,Mar,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/030424-monday-monday-east-campus-moat-20240304.html,"Following reported, misinformed concerns from students about rising crime rates in Durham, Duke announced plans to destroy the running paths along the perimeter of the campus and replace them with a moat. To exit East Campus, students will now be required to leap or swim. “This is part of an ambitious project to keep pollutants off of our campus,"" University President Pincent Vice said, referring to the residents of Durham. “For too long we have allowed foreign, non-Duke substances to tarnish our facilities. This moat will filter out any unwanted contaminants, while also providing a state-of-the-art practice facility for our esteemed rowing team.”The moat will cost at least $25 million to construct and maintain, span 12 feet in width and boast state-of-the-art drawbridges that will only drop for the Shooters bus and C1-Swift bus. Coincidentally, $25 million is the exact same amount it would cost to save the herbarium. In an email to the Chronicle, head of facilities Ristopher Kossi insisted that the number “had no connection.”“We will be very careful about who has access to the drawbridge,” said Ihait Porpeepl, head of security for East Campus. “We are very alarmed by the demographics surrounding East Campus and want to keep our students safe,” she continued, evidently referring to the million-dollar home that was just sold on Markham Avenue (a note to the uninformed reader — that’s the road right behind Baldwin). Presently, the East Campus walkways are heavily used and beloved by members of the surrounding community. “We had to put an end to that,” said Kossi, “We cannot be providing services for people who do not pay tuition.” “Duke spends half a million dollars on maintaining the East Campus trail every year,” continued Kossi, “These paths are an expensive endeavor that mostly serves outsiders to the Duke community. Thanks to a generous donation by one of our esteemed alumni, we are very excited to bring the Ravid M. Dubenstein moat to life.”The moat threatens to endanger access to students’ favorite Durham activity: frat parties. The construction of the moat goes hand-in-hand with the increase in police presence at fraternity parties, alienating more students from the beloved Duke-Durham practice of peeing on neighbors’ lawns. Some students also expressed concerns that the moat could create barriers to accessing Whole Foods for those who lacked the strong swimming capabilities it took to cross. “Where am I supposed to get my hypo-allergenic, gluten-free organic asparagus now? I am literally going to starve,” first-year Sally Bozos lamented. Others shared similar concerns about the new lack of access to overpriced groceries. “I sympathize with the moat construction,” said junior Catherine Ma, a senator on the Duke Student Government’s Durham-Community Affairs Committee. “As a born and raised New Yorker, I understand the challenges of balancing community safety and needs with surrounding city culture.” Ma is from Long Island. Along with the moat, President Vice announced future plans for an electric fence around the East Campus wall and paying housekeeping staff an extra 50 cents an hour to work as security guards, keeping out anyone whose parents make less than $300,000 a year.This past weekend, Monday Monday was forced to don their bullet-proof vest and drive their armored vehicle to retrieve a catering order from Monuts. They are still shaken from the experience."
The curriculum isn't the problem,Heidi Smith,2024-03-04T05:00:00Z,Mar,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/030424-smith-curriculum-not-the-problem-20240304.html,"You can’t force students to be intellectually curious. Regardless of Trinity's requirements, Duke students will — if they so desire — find ways of gamifying, bending the rules and cheapening the intentions set out by the administration. To address this, we must recognize that all students exist on a spectrum from only wanting a degree to learning for the sake of it and that most of us land somewhere in between.While I’d like to think I’d still go to college if it weren’t a near necessity for socioeconomic success these days, it’s naïve to believe that interest alone is why people come to a place like Duke. Ultimately, the classes we take are only one piece of the broader puzzle, and a complete overhaul of the generalized boxes we have to tick before receiving our diplomas may do more harm than good — or, likely, it won’t change much at all.This may be an unpopular opinion, but I like the current T-Reqs. The new plan, which the Arts & Sciences Council will vote on in April, focuses on taking two courses each in six categories, without the possibility for as much overlap and double-counting as the current requirements allow. A fellow columnist suggested a similar — but somewhat more rigid in terms of subjects rather than tags — building-block style proposal. Instead of allowing the mixing and matching of tagged subjects, students under these style curriculums must take a certain set total number of courses from each of several categories.Even if this alternative method is adopted, I’m confident that future Duke students will continue to find novel methods for deflating the rigor of their coursework. We can probably chalk some of this up to Duke admitting intellectually incurious students, but that’s another issue. Perhaps when we’re told we must do something, we have a gut reaction to resist. In other words, it’s not the extent to which we agree with what we have to follow but that we have to follow a list of exigencies at all. Indeed, it’s in the spirit of the university for us students to bond over a mutual dislike of authority that we must reluctantly obey (see: tenting and line monitors).Additionally, because there is a perception that students don’t care as much about learning for learning’s sake anymore, professors cater to those perceived wishes and help enable a reality in which they become inarguably true. I’ve discussed my distaste for new-wave pedagogy before, so I won’t rehash all of it here, but I will say that, as a student, I’m going to take a class as seriously as a professor takes it — respect is a two-way street. These days, it feels more challenging to find “rigorous” classes to take than “easy” ones — sure, the culpability for this isn’t singular, but students aren’t the ones laying out the course catalog.What the current curriculum does give students, though, is a significant sense of freedom — if we so choose to use it — to chart one of any number of paths through the Trinity curriculum. Yes, people take advantage of this. For me — and I think a lot of other students — it has allowed our courses of study to explore disparate interests deeply. On the other hand, the curriculum allowed many people to graduate knowing a little about a lot of things or not much about anything at all.I’ll admit there have been some gaps in my education. When I go to an art museum, I have no means of analyzing the pieces beyond saying which ones I think look pretty. Additionally, I still don’t understand why we can’t just print more money and not tell anyone about it. And don’t even try to solicit my opinion on any matters of geopolitical scale unless I can ask my brother how I’m “supposed to think about it” first. Is that a failure in my education, or just a side effect of being able to specialize?Still, I’ve read James Joyce’s ""Ulysses"" in its entirety and can code a binary search tree in assembly language. I can almost guarantee that, under a less flexible curriculum, I simply would not have been able to double major in Computer Science and English, two subjects that have no overlapping courses but, when taken in concert, allowed me to satisfy nearly all of the T-Reqs with classes in which I was genuinely interested. The question Duke administrators must answer before overhauling Trinity’s curriculum is whether they want us to graduate as a jack of all trades or a master of a few.I’d advocate for the latter. While something like Brown’s Open Curriculum would be a manifestation of this to the extreme, I don’t know that Duke students could handle that level of self-direction just yet. Under what we have now, with Modes of Inquiry and Areas of Knowledge, one can be pretty flexible within the existing constraints — it’s really up to the student how seriously they take their own education. Duke imposing stricter requirements on the curriculum isn’t going to suddenly make us all want to study Classics for the joy of it all if that passion doesn't already exist.The main reasons for changing the current curriculum seem to be Trinity students’ gamification of completing the requirements and the lack of student interest in taking courses from specific departments, particularly those within humanities fields. To address that first point, even if students are trying to double or triple count T-Reqs, it’s not as though that decision is making them take fewer classes overall. We all still need the 34 credits to graduate. Choosing to assume the best in others, if we’re using those extra credits to take more courses in subjects related to our primary fields of study, then adding stricter requirements would actually stifle intellectual curiosity.As for the hive-mind-like draw toward certain subjects and away from others, again, I come back to my first point: you can’t force intellectual curiosity. Creating stricter standards about which subjects students have to take inevitably breeds discontent. Don’t get me wrong, I think STEM students need to take non-STEM classes, and — contrary to another columnist’s take — non-STEM students should take at least a couple of STEM courses. That’s what liberal arts is, and that’s what we signed up for. But, more importantly than what we study, a liberal arts education should give us the tools to become more autonomous and capable of making decisions about our own paths, and a stricter curriculum is not the way to encourage self-determination.Heidi Smith is a Trinity senior.

The joy of studying with ChatGPT,Jessica Luan,2024-03-01T05:00:00Z,Mar,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/030124-luan-joy-chatgpt-20240301.html,"Duke students love being productive, and they love feeling productive even more. ChatGPT, which can streamline one’s workflow, might seem irresistible. Yet, many students barely use it. This is unsurprising, as ChatGPT’s reputation was shaky from the start. Early news coverage portrayed ChatGPT as a one-trick pony. It was exceptional at passing standardized exams or writing mediocre essays, but not much else. By extension, students curious about ChatGPT were opportunistic, seeking academic shortcuts.Overall, most narratives are either didactic or unrealistic. They either insinuate that ChatGPT users are morally compromised or overhype ChatGPT’s capabilities, leading to inflated expectations. One narrative that critics overlook is the feeling of working with ChatGPT. It helps me overcome writer’s block, enhance my productivity and build self-efficacy with ease.Speed bumps riddle my writing process. With distractions just a click away, minor inconveniences — finding the right word, fixing clunky sentences or crafting a strong conclusion — become a convenient excuse to procrastinate. ChatGPT blasts through these challenges, freeing up my creative energy. It helps me select the perfect synonym and untangle wordy sentences. With ChatGPT's help, I feel less pressure to produce perfect writing from the start, allowing my ideas to flow. Second, ChatGPT is like a learning compass. In the past, when I didn’t know where to start on a problem set, I would have to wait a few days to ask a TA during office hours. With ChatGPT, I can get an answer instantly. It’s not always an amazing answer. While ChatGPT might identify the general concept or provide a possible solution, it is helpless with details. If I provide a counterexample, ChatGPT fails to modify its answer accordingly. It even butchers simple arithmetic. However, with ChatGPT’s guidance, I’ll know which lectures to rewatch or which keywords to search for on YouTube. ChatGPT’s outputs are imperfect, but they are usually a step in the right direction. The feeling of blazing through an assignment rather than slogging through it is addictive. Success begets success, and ChatGPT created a powerful sense of momentum, which inspires even greater confidence in my abilities. Yet, when ChatGPT first came out, I didn’t want to touch it. Because I assumed its only purpose was to spit out essays and exam answers, I associated its use with bad behavior. I thought my job was to spew out essays and exam answers. This was how I proved my dedication to learning. If I used ChatGPT (which only to expedite these tasks) what would become of me? In fact, I had conflated utilizing ChatGPT with depending on ChatGPT. When students write essays now, they aren’t limited to just a pen and paper. In fact, they might write down ideas by hand, conduct research on the Internet then type drafts on a word processor. These papers are always more polished than a timed pen-and-paper essay. ChatGPT — like Google Drive, Grammarly or a Bic Pen — is one of many study tools. Now, ChatGPT has altered my learning process. It reduces barriers to getting started and keeps me moving forward. In the past, students might tap their pen anxiously or stare helplessly into VSCode’s unyielding cursor. Now, ChatGPT stands ready to provide brainstorming, debugging and translation services 24/7, fueling continuous progress. Undeniably, some students may care more about submitting something rather than submitting something good. ChatGPT can facilitate laziness and dishonesty by churning out deliverables that are just good enough.However, other students may seek to beef up their study methods or to improve their mindset toward learning. It is the user’s responsibility to wield ChatGPT for growth. In my experience, ChatGPT’s magic is not its answers, but rather its ability to change my mindset around learning. Just knowing that ChatGPT is available can make you feel more confident before a study session. And when you feel better, your learning will likely be better too. If you’re not using ChatGPT already, give it a try. A happier, more studious and more productive version of you awaits.Jessica Luan is a Trinity senior.

We don't need more safe spaces,Gabrielle Mollin,2024-02-29T05:00:00Z,Feb,29,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/022924-mollin-safe-spaces-polarization-politics-20240229.html,"Did you know that Duke’s Sanford School of Public Policy has a dedicated “safe space?” Located in a former office in Rubenstein Hall, the safe space is a “respite from discourse that can be demeaning, antagonistic or fraught.” The idea of the “safe space” — physical or metaphorical — is certainly no stranger on college campuses, including Duke. Administrators, professors and student leaders alike devote themselves to maintaining this safe space, supposedly keeping people happy, comfortable and (most importantly) safe. I must admit, however, that the ubiquitous reliance on “safe spaces” throughout Duke’s campus doesn’t leave me with so much of a warm, cozy feeling, but more of a persistent frustration. The surface-level notion of a safe space doesn’t seem all that controversial. Students should be confident that their classrooms are free from discrimination, harassment and any sort of severe physical or emotional harm. This kind of safe space should absolutely be a campus priority.Yet in actuality, the “safe space” is an unfortunate oxymoron. A safe space doesn’t necessarily signal community and comfort, but rather censorship and anxiety. From my perspective, safe spaces are merely platforms for groupthink, absent of the diversity and disagreement that often leads to intellectual growth. You are safe if you follow the pre-ordained discussion checklist. But if you deviate from the norm, not only have you made the “safe space” unsafe, but now you yourself are also unsafe in the “safe space.” Safe spaces function under the guise of protection from harm, but they functionally shelter students from genuine truth and disagreement while simultaneously stoking anxiety about openly voicing opinions. This contrived notion of a safe space could not be further from the comfort and freedom I felt in my political polarization class last semester with Professor John Rose. Throughout the semester, our class ventured into the depths of political debate, delving into contentious topics like abortion, affirmative action, gender identity and pronouns to build community, understanding and respect amid political disagreement. In an alarmingly binary political culture that consistently stifles open debate and denies the plausibility of bipartisan friendship, I found this class utterly refreshing. I raved to my friends and family about the sense of community in the classroom — despite the political variance — and the absolute emphasis on free speech in stark contrast to some of my other political science and public policy classes. During each class, without fail, students would share their truthful opinions. And they did so because they knew that the classroom was truly safe. Not safe in the typical university sense, but safe due to the assumption of good faith. Our classroom was able to flourish into the world of free and open debate because everyone in that classroom believed everyone was well-intentioned. We had to listen with our hearts, not just our heads. We had to understand where one another was coming from. We had to see each other as people, not political caricatures. We had to hear things that made us uncomfortable, angry and upset.We had to feel unsafe to truly be safe. My dad likes to joke that this class I held in such high regard was really just class back in his day. And as much as I want to prove him wrong, he has a point that this course shouldn’t be as revolutionary as I’m making it out to seem. A political science course should have discourse from across the political spectrum and should feel uncomfortable and controversial at times. It should not be safe, and Professor Rose’s class should not be an exception to the norm of safe spaces in classrooms but an exemplar of a new norm for open and honest debate. To many, the prospect of an academic space with complete and utter free speech on an elite college campus in 2024 still seems wholly delusional. Yet somehow, PoliSci 208 achieved that. And to me, that is the ultimate safe space. Gabrielle Mollin is a Trinity sophomore. Her columns typically run on alternate Thursday's."
Why people hate professors,Carol Apollonio,2024-02-28T05:00:00Z,Feb,28,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/022824-apollonio-why-people-hate-professors-20240228.html,"Some people I love have spent their lives doing heavy labor: carpentry, warehouse work, truck driving. In my younger years, I spent a lot of time doing what they used to call “waitressing” — a profession that entails its share of heavy lifting and running back and forth, unpredictable hours, no benefits, and a miserable, insulting salary. A lot of what I do these days can be done lying on the sofa, but it is demanding in its own right. The insides of my brain ache at the end of a long day spent following complicated plot lines; remembering scores of names; deciphering impenetrable literary theories; explaining to students why perfect work can only earn them a 95; breaking into maddening, heavily barricaded websites; and grappling with — but never answering — the great accursed questions. Recently my job has gotten way more difficult. When Russia invaded Ukraine, everything flipped. The authors I have admired and studied my whole life for their exploration of the conscience, of right and wrong, of the mysteries of human life on the planet, are now being quoted to support the brutalities going on in the war. I find myself facing questions like, ""How can you study Russia when the Russians are committing such atrocities?"" Yes: bombing hospitals and orphanages, blowing up apartment buildings, torturing and abusing innocent civilians. There is no doubt about these horrors — thanks to the miracles of the internet, we witness them in real-time. These days, I crave the kind of job where I can hammer nails into things; pick heavy boxes up and move them around; run heavy, loud machinery; and come home after eight hours to a cold six-pack and some TV. Anything to drown out the awareness of my helplessness to ease the sufferings of the war’s innocent victims. But as they say, взался за гуж, не говори, что не дюж — “You picked up the damn thing, so don’t say that you can’t carry it.” (Don’t ask me to explain the original Russian, which has to do with the esoterica of horse harnesses.) In short, I decided to teach Russian literature, and so I’m stuck. Two years have elapsed since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. I find myself back where I started my study of the country, culture, literature and language — the Cold War — a time where the best thinkers were “repressed,” imprisoned, censored and murdered for speaking their minds. It’s almost as though these 35 years were an anomaly and now we’re back to business as usual. But some things over here in the “free world” of academic inquiry have disturbed me. There have been calls to stop studying Russia and even Russian literature altogether: Why give a minute’s time to thugs and executioners? (Dostoevsky is the enemy.)In selecting my life’s path, I committed myself to studying a particular culture and literature. I did not commit myself to supporting whatever the political leaders over there were doing. And neither did the courageous writers whose works I teach. Regular people may not know better (ruining Russian businesses too), but it is a fact that Russia’s elite thinkers, artists, writers and journalists have had to leave the country — precisely for their opposition to the atrocities going on there now. Now here’s the hard part. The mission of a university, especially an elite one, would seem to be to pursue objective truth — not to advocate for any political agenda, no matter how admirable. In short, the fact that I study Russian literature does not automatically mean that I support Vladimir Putin and his thugs. If only I had decided to study ethics or environmental protection or human rights! Then I’d be off the hook. In my regular life, after all, I support good behavior, saving the planet and justice for all. But down here in my foxhole, I wonder: Is it possible that people might be studying ethics so as to learn how not to get caught when they cheat (maybe they won't catch me)? Or environmental regulation so they can get a job advising corporations how to get away with trashing the planet? All that aside, I’m putting myself in the place of a minimum-wage worker hammering stuff onto an icy roof in a construction site in Maine; or a Durham city employee in a fluorescent vest pouring hot tar on a street on a 100-degree summer day. What does it look like from there to see someone whose job entails standing in a climate-controlled classroom lecturing smugly about a righteous cause; or sitting at a desk writing stuff about that cause; who can afford to buy local and never set foot in the Walmart; who has state-of-the-art health insurance, an outrageously high salary, a plump retirement fund, “summers off,” and — here’s the clincher — who can never be fired, e-v-e-r? Out of sheer jealousy, spite, and frustration, I might very well come down from that icy roof and cast my vote for someone who shares my fury.

"Colleagues, students and peers remember Hans Joris Van Miegroet",Viktoria Wulff-Andersen,2024-02-27T05:00:00Z,Feb,27,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/022724-wulff-andersen-hans-joris-van-miegroet-tributes-20240227.html,"Editor’s Note: These tributes to Hans J. Van Miegroet, professor of art and art history at Duke who passed away on Feb. 9, were originally submitted to the department of art, art history and visual studies. The Chronicle has compiled quotes from these tributes with permission from their authors. Please visit the Department of Art, Art History & Visual Studies “Tributes to Hans Van Miegroet” page to read the tributes in full and see their accompanying pictures. Kristine Stiles, Ph.D.France Family distinguished professor of art, art history and visual studies and member of the Nasher Museum’s National Board of Advisors’ Collections Committee “Hans van Miegroet was a gifted artist, art historian, and creative thinker in numerous fields from the humanities to the social and natural sciences and law. His research on emerging Art Markets was grounded in questions of copyright, cultural heritage, visual culture, and new research strategies and modes of interpretation. When he once served as Chair of the Department, he expanded Art & Art History to include Visual Studies. Hans was a loving father of two children, a supportive colleague and a friend. His kindness, memorable playfulness and wry sense of humor were unparalleled. He will be acutely missed.”Filip Vermeylen, Ph.D.Professor of Global Art Markets and the research director at the department of arts and culture studies at Erasmus University Rotterdam“His can-do mentality was very un-Belgian, and he found the United States to be a much more suitable environment for his out-of-the-box thinking. He built a great career doing so at Duke University which spanned decades. As a teacher, he was a true performer who could captivate, inspire, and entertain his audience, even if many did not understand his thick Ghent accent. As a researcher, he relentlessly sought and found collaboration across disciplines and geographical boundaries. And when he teamed up with economist Neil De Marchi, they would change the field of art market studies forever. Neil and Hans invited me to join their ongoing workshop in 1998, and this involvement has shaped my thinking on art and economics till this day.”Kaylee P. Alexander, Ph.D.Research data librarian at the J. Willard Marriott Library at the University of Utah“First and foremost, Hans was someone who truly loved what he did and took great pride in his students’ accomplishments. He was a fervent advocate for all creative thinkers and valued student input—undergrads and graduate students alike—like no other professor I’ve had in all my years as a higher ed student (and that is saying a lot given my 12 years as an undergrad/grad student).”…“His courses brought together students from the humanities and social sciences — even hard sciences and engineering at times — to work collaboratively on data-intensive, original research that was truly a unique undergraduate experience. He loved seeing all the diverse career paths that his students entered.”Patrick HerronAI Consultant at Hypothia“It is with a very heavy heart I share the news of the passing of my colleague and friend of so many years, Hans J. Van Miegroet. We did so many wonderful things together over more than a decade at Duke, and working with him was one of the best experiences of my life. For years we worked together in the Art Department on projects for his beloved visionary DALMI project, building Media Arts + Sciences, CMAC, and sharing some wonderful and unforgettable meals.”…“Hans is gone way too soon but his life was certainly full; he had the stories to show for it. Hans was filled with largesse that was exceeded by his vision for data-driven art economics, inventive educational programs and a drive for generous mentorship of so many students passing through his door who must be hurting today. My thoughts go out to his family and to the students who worked so closely with him, especially Fiene Leunissen, Kaylee Alexander, Felipe Alvarez de Toledo Lopez-Herrera, and so many others.”Robert Mayhew, Ph.D.Associate professor of fine arts at Wake Technical Community College“I spent ten years working with him and he left an indelible mark on my life. Although I had not spoken to him in a few years, the news of his passing brought back a flood of experiences as his graduate student. Not only was he a world-class scholar; he was also an exceptional teacher. He relentlessly encouraged me to think unconventionally, which I often resisted, but all the while he opened new possibilities to a larger world of ideas, experiences, and friendships.”…“Over the years, he believed in me even when I didn’t believe in myself. In his classroom and in our daily conversations, he always had a unique way with words, whether in Dutch, French or English - sometimes all in the same sentence - and an absolute joie de vivre that was completely infectious. He showed me that it was perfectly OK to simultaneously be a consummate, polished professional while showing an unapologetic, impassioned and almost child-like fascination for what you’re teaching.”Ron Spronk, Ph.D.Professor of art history at the department of art history and art conservation at Queen’s University“I was very saddened to hear about the sudden death of Hans Van Miegroet, a long-time colleague in the field of Early Netherlandish painting. I still use his brilliant finding of the 'phantom copy' every year in my courses, and I was delighted that Hans was able to speak on that topic at our Bruegel symposium in Vienna in 2019. He will be dearly missed. My condolences to his colleagues and family.”Lieutenant Colonel Kevin D. Kornegay, U.S. Army, J.D., LL.M.“I first met Prof. Hans van Miegroet nearly thirty years ago. In 1995, in the spring semester of my freshman year at Duke, I decided to take ART 70, the survey course on art history from the Renaissance to the 20th century. Hans was the instructor. He was a captivating, brilliant lecturer, who combined profound erudition with tremendous energy, enthusiasm, and child-like joy.”"
Slow and steady wins the race,Anna Sorensen,2024-02-27T05:00:00Z,Feb,27,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/022724-sorensen-slow-steady-wins-race-20240227.html,"A few weeks ago, Punxsutawney Phil declared that spring would arrive early this year. What good news! Sunshine is on the way! Well, Groundhog Day this year has got me thinking; it’s a strange concept for many reasons. However, I’ve recently tried to move beyond my confusion over our country’s reverence for this rodent to reflect on the broader significance of this holiday. The arrival of spring seems like a universally positive promise. With spring comes fresh starts, longer days and tamer nights. And yet, these springtime gifts have not been in the forefront of my mind lately. Over the past few days and weeks, I’ve caught myself fast-forwarding through spring with my mind set on summer. I’m often dreaming of a break from school work, basking in the sun with friends and family at home. To make matters worse, this year more than ever I feel like the spring semester is flying by at an astounding pace. We’ve found ourselves suddenly in the swings of midterm season, and spring break is only two short weeks away. I’ll admit that a lot has happened since we returned from winter break, but it feels like the weeks have passed in a blink of an eye. As a sophomore, the swift passage of time is not one I look upon lightly. I’ll be declaring my major soon, and even if my fleeting time at Duke is lost on me, I’ll have the “halfway there!” celebration in April to remind me that the clock is constantly ticking. Spring at Duke runs by faster than the fall for a variety of reasons. The lack of days off in the semester leading up to spring break seems to accelerate the weeks before; weeks mesh together and our interrupted routine makes it hard to differentiate one from another. Once we return from break, it’s even more of a sprint to the finish with five short weeks until LDOC. Beyond the semester schedule, however, I’ve been considering how our mindsets can contribute to this swift passage of time. At the center of it all lies what I see as a culture of “getting through” in college. At Duke (and I’m sure we’re not unique as a university in this), we often exist in a mindset of counting down. We countdown the hours until class is over, the days until exams and the weeks until break. We tell ourselves that we “just have to get through this week” or that we’ll “be done once this assignment is over.” I talk to myself this way all the time during tough periods, and I fully understand how it can help manage stress and motivate us to push through hard times. I’ve also found, though, that I sometimes use this logic to make excuses for not taking care of myself and my mental health. I may accept that an entire week is destined to be rough, telling myself that if I put my head down and get through it, I can relax and be happier later. I know I’m neither alone in adopting this mindset nor in acknowledging its danger.If we continue with this attitude, we risk wishing away the majority of our time here at Duke. In focusing on “getting through” the difficult parts of college, we miss the greater sense of what we’re doing here at all. I’ll be the first to insist that it’s perfectly healthy to look forward to time at home or on vacation. Yet, it doesn't need to come at the cost of cherishing our time in college. When I try to abandon the mindset of “getting through,” I wonder what it is I really want to accomplish in my time here at Duke. I certainly don’t want to look back in ten years and wish I had been more present or that I had appreciated each day more in college. However, this sort of presence isn’t easy to practice. It’s difficult to take a step back and consider the broader purpose of college. It takes effort to focus on the present moment rather than the destination. One practice I’ve recently begun is doing something unique every day. Whether it’s going for a ten minute walk in the gardens, trying something new at WU, using the massage chairs at the Wellness Center or catching up with an old friend, I try something different whenever I can to make each day unique. I’m also trying to say yes to more. It’s a mantra my mom always insists on, and I know it sounds cheesy, but it helps me feel grounded and excited for each day. I’m not trying to be preachy here — I fully recognize that grades and work are important to our time in college and beyond. But I truly believe that we don’t have to make them the most important all the time. We can’t constantly focus on the things we want to be over, because we’ll end up missing all the other good we can squeeze out of our time here. We may find a useful motto in the words of the Latin poet Horace, who famously declared, “carpe diem.” While popular culture has traditionally understood this phrase as a call to seize each day with vigor, the literal translation of “pluck the day” seems more fitting to me. When spring rolls around and the flowers start blooming, may we all try to appreciate the delicate beauty of each passing moment.We are unbelievably lucky to be at a school like Duke — and not just because of the opportunities it affords us when we graduate. We would be doing ourselves and our community a disservice if we neglected the full extent of our potential here. So, as the work ramps up and the weeks fly by, remind yourself that your difficult days here are more than hours to get through. When you cross the stage at graduation one day, I bet part of you will be wishing for them back. Anna Sorensen is a Trinity sophomore. Her column typically runs on alternate Tuesdays."
Poetry and suffering,Luke A. Powery,2024-02-26T05:00:00Z,Feb,26,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/022624-powery-poetry-suffering-20240226.html,"Look around locally and globally and you will see tremendous human suffering. It is empathetic to recognize the reality of suffering, but you can’t explain it. Wisdom tells us this.How do you explain a young 29-year-old woman, going for a run, and then collapsing and dying? How do you explain when a 12-year-old girl goes to a hospital complaining of a stomachache only to discover her intestines have twisted and eventually dies? How do you explain when religious leaders who have so-called successful ministries still commit suicide?Our answers always fail and are always inadequate in the face of suffering. When the biblical character Job endured great suffering, his friends tried to make sense of things and explain why he was going through it. He told them: “As for you, you whitewash with lies; all of you are worthless physicians. If you would only keep silent, that would be your wisdom!” (Job 13:4-5). It’s a reminder that sometimes the best thing to say is nothing at all!Think about how people, at times, use platitudes in the face of unexplainable suffering — ""God needed your child in heaven because God needed another angel."" Or, ""Everything happens for a reason."" Or, ""God is testing you."" In those times, we should become like Job and say to those who always try to come up with answers: “If you would only keep silent, that would be your wisdom.”Interestingly, the bulk of the Book of Job in the Hebrew scriptures is poetry. Short narratives function as the bookends but most of the grappling with suffering — the questioning, wondering and angst — is poetic. This so-called wisdom literature reveals that you may not be able to prose your way through suffering; you may have to poeticize a pathway through it. Poetry is the language of the suffering.We also see this with the creators of the Spirituals in the context of slavery. There is a poetics of pain, and it is wise to confront suffering with poetry. The word “poiesis,” which is related to the ancient Greek word for poetry, refers to the process of making. The relationship between these words points to how people, historically, have tried to make their way through suffering with poetic language — making as they are aching.In his book “Poetry as Survival,” poet Gregory Orr speaks of his own tragedy as a child and its relationship to the emergence of poetry in his life. When he was 12 years old, he was responsible for a hunting accident in which his younger brother died. He was “horrified and traumatized.” His parents were so devastated and angry that they couldn’t offer him any consolation. Then there was a family friend who counseled him that his brother’s death was a part of God’s plan. Orr writes, “This notion of a divine order that had the power to subsume such violent disorder didn't seem believable to me and failed to help me live through the traumatic crisis that had become my life.” There were others who used words like “accident” but that wasn’t helpful either to him because it wasn’t a response to the tragedy, only a description of it. It didn’t provide an ordering or meaning, and, as a 12-year-old boy, he deeply desired meaning in order to survive what he had done.Years after the tragedy, an order, a meaning, came through Mrs. Irving, the librarian in his small public school, through whom he discovered poetry. In the small English class that Mrs. Irving taught in his senior year of high school, she had the class write all kinds of things: stories, sketches, plays and haiku. Orr says:“I wrote a poem one day, and it changed my life. I had a sudden sense that the language in poetry was ‘magical,’ unlike language in fiction: that it could create or transform reality rather than simply describe it. That first poem I wrote was a simple, escapist fantasy, but it liberated the enormous energy of my despair and oppression as nothing before had ever done. I felt simultaneously revealed to myself and freed of myself by the images and actions of the poem. I knew from that moment on that all I wanted to do was write poems. I knew that if I was to survive in this life, it would only be through the help of poetry.”As with Orr, poetry can help us survive great suffering. We can pen our pain on paper and make as we ache. Poetry may not stop your individual suffering or the suffering of the world, but it can keep you alive and ensure that you are not consumed by existential chaos.The Rev. Dr. Luke A.

The grass is as fake as the people who walk on it,Aaron Siegle,2024-02-23T05:00:00Z,Feb,23,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/022324-siegle-fake-grass-20240223.html,"Merely a scent of the noxious odor emanating from Abele Quad was enough to drive me back into the library. From the safety of the great indoors, I was able to watch the Dust-Bowl-era scene unfolding on the other side of the glass. Clouds of dirt billowed from the barren soil, concealing the azure blue sky above. A column of tractors spewed tiny pellets of synthetic fertilizer across the parched earth, which then helplessly flew away with the next gust of wind. Such hardships must be necessary to prepare for the day when the verdant strips of turf will magically form a pristine lawn, right?The remodeling of Abele Quad generates the usual inconveniences associated with any construction project. Ironically, the most damaging aspect of the project is its objective — to make campus more ""green."" Ever since Carolina Green Athletic Field Construction rolled out bales of artificial turf across the heart of Duke’s campus, the lawn has looked stunning. But beneath its glamorous appearance, the grass harbors ecological and social malaise.Sometimes the grass is greener on the other side because it’s fake. Duke’s landscaping decision is a form of values signaling that impacts the thoughts, identity and appearance of those who tread on it.Lawns are America’s most irrigated ""crop."" Given that the city of Durham almost cut off Duke’s water supply during a drought in 2007, the amount of lawn on campus is problematic. Duke’s Climate Action Plan identifies emissions from fertilizer as a significant source of the university’s emissions. Lawns function as an ecological trap, attracting fauna such as insects only to kill them off due to a lack of habitat. Additionally, a lawnmower running for a mere hour emits the same amount of harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as a car traveling 400 miles. And don’t forget that lawnmowers expel a disproportionate amount of tropospheric ozone and noise pollution relative to their size.Although these realities may be concerning, they don’t explain how lawns shape us and our identity.To answer this question, let’s take a brief journey through the history of lawns in Western society. Lawns began as a sign of feudal power in medieval Europe while also serving the practical purpose of making it easier to spot approaching enemies. It wasn’t until the mid-20th century and the rise of suburbia when common folk could afford to maintain their own lawn. Policies of racial segregation in the lush suburbs made lawns a symbol of white superiority, according to civil rights icon John Lewis.In other words, rolling out the green carpets isn’t just bad for the environment, it flies in the face of the university’s goals to make Duke a more inclusive place.“Lawns are symbolic of our lack of thought,” read a sign that appeared soon after the fresh turf was plopped into place on Abele Quad. It is appropriate that the sign was a part of 11th Organ, a Duke Arts program centered around innovative art forms.From an academic perspective, this maxim couldn’t be truer. A typical day in the life of a Duke student involves copying and pasting code from the internet, memorizing all 20 amino acids or calculating the deadweight loss of a market inefficiency. While all these skills may be professionally valuable, they don’t take that much creativity or original thinking. Our limited curiosity is exhibited by the decline of humanities at Duke and across the nation. In a way, our thoughts mirror the grass we gaze upon — both are uniform, facile and repetitive.The grass also mirrors our own fakeness, our attempt to live up to expectations that we are not designed to meet. Think about it. Biologically speaking, grass isn’t supposed to be bright green in the middle of winter, even in North Carolina. But because of our preconceived notions of grass as evergreen, Duke replaced real grass with fake grass to satisfy our expectations. In the same way, we attempt to project an image of ourselves as an overachiever, a pathbreaking innovator — someone who never fails. But this masks our true selves, people ridden with struggles, shortcomings and uncertainty.We crave a landscape that matches the superficiality of our existence. In many ways, this shallowness is predictable, driven by market forces. Social media feeds prioritize posts that reinforce stereotypical archetypes because they know this content will generate more engagements. Students tailor their resumes and thus their lives to fit the specifications of large corporations. In other words, creativity may get you into Duke, but conformity helps you succeed at Duke. We came into Duke as wildflowers but then realized that being grass is easier and ultimately more lucrative.I understand that Duke will never get rid of all its lawn. But there are practical solutions that can lessen the environmental and cultural burden lawn places on the community. Pocket prairies are biodiversity-rich patches of native grasses planted in urban areas. Replacing sections of the Abele Quad turf with pocket prairies will enhance habitat as well as add diversity to the otherwise dull landscape. Perhaps more importantly, these patches of native grasses, with their intricate stems and distinctive flowers, will demonstrate to visitors and students alike that Duke values a variety of ideas. Already, universities across America such as Marquette and Oklahoma State have livened up their campuses with real nature.Changing our campus culture will take a more grassroots (no pun intended) effort. But I am hopeful that students can take cues from nature and pursue interests merely for their intrinsic value.Grass oversimplifies the beauty that nature has to offer. Let’s make sure that the lawns of life don’t dim the magnificence of our human nature.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity sophomore. His column typically runs on alternate Fridays."
"You don’t have to be a helicopter mom, Duke. You can let us go.",Alex Berkman,2024-02-22T13:36:00Z,Feb,22,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/022224-berkman-duke-helicopter-mom-20240222.html,"A mother is sending off her first born to Duke. It’s freshmen move-in day, and all the helicopter moms have said their final goodbyes — all but her of course. The family of three stand in front of the chapel, the sun has now set. Her husband tries to pull her way, and her son is itching to get to his first Shooters pre-game (where only water will be served, of course). She grabs hold of her child; promises to never let go; tears flow uncontrollably.Now, to clarify, this story is not about me. After all, when my parents dropped me off, not only did they not cry, they celebrated for the next month. “You take him, Duke!” “Sayonara Alex!”Now back to the story. But out of the darkness, a mysterious yet impressive figure emerges. It is President Price. He gently grasps the mother’s shoulders, and tells her but one line. “It is okay to let go.” Miraculously, she releases hold of her child. As the boy begins walking to catch the C1, he cannot help but smile. Finally, he may lead a life of complete liberation. Then, like out of a nightmare, the Duke housing officers and the Global Education Office (GEO) staff appear suddenly out of the bushes. President Price — their leader — walks in front of them. He stares at the student and says but one word.“Gotchaaa!”Price and now an entire ensemble of Duke bureaucratic workers begin pointing and laughing uncontrollably at the boy. Dejected and, quite frankly, a little bit terrified, he walks onto the C1, completely defeated. After 18 years of having had his mother breathe down his neck, the boy finally thought he would be set free. Sadly, he was mistaken. First, I must preface that Duke is an incredible place where the students enjoy a multitude of freedoms. Nonetheless, the university insists on holding — or better yet, guiding — our hands each step of the way. And for this reason, I say to President Price what he had told the mother in this story. “It is okay to let go.”In rhetoric, sure, the Duke administration has expressed the greatest trust in their student body, composed of some of the brightest young minds in the world. However, their insistence on intervening in the lives of its students suggests the opposite — that Duke has little to no trust in us at all. And although I have only attended this university for 1.5 years, it truly feels like each semester, Duke introduces a new reform to cap the autonomy of its students. Most recently, this was a dramatic change to Duke’s study abroad program. In the first weeks of November, if a blind visitor were to have conversations with the sophomore student body, they likely would leave having no idea that it was peak midterm season. They would, however, be able to articulate — in great detail — all of the new rule changes to Duke’s study abroad program and explain precisely how we were all being “screwed over.” For the readers who do not know, prior to this year, students could study at any of the Duke-in or Duke-approved programs for their semester abroad. However, due to an “overabundance” of students in Madrid, Florence and Copenhagen these past few years, Duke’s Global Education Office (GEO) made the decision to set 50-person caps on all programs. Those programs that surpassed 50 sign-ups would be sent to a lottery, where from there, it became random luck as to whether or not you were accepted. Yes, it is true that this new initiative greatly limits the opportunity for STEM and Engineering students to study at a program of their choosing. But, there is a greater issue at hand, one that has become synonymous with Duke’s administration. A semester abroad is often described as the best few months of college, and for many, the best of their lives. Yet on multiple occasions in preparation for program sign ups, the GEO stuaff articulated their intent to separate large collectives of friends from sticking together. And to this, I ask plain and simple:How does this concern you and why are you so invested in the path we take?If a student chooses to embark on a solo expedition to Tanzania or Ecuador and comes back with an enlightened world view, this should be celebrated. But in the same way, if one prefers an experience of partying in Madrid and traversing through Europe’s great cities, that should also be welcomed. As someone who favors the former option (of non-European travel), I am still able to acknowledge that not everything needs to be about “personal growth.” In the end, we are still just kids, who should not only be allowed to but encouraged to maximize the amount of fun we have. Thus, it is entirely understandable that students want to experience this time alongside their closest friends … all of them. However, because Duke assumes that they know precisely what's best for our development, many students will be deprived of this. Still, undoubtedly the greatest change to Duke life has been the evolution of Duke housing as an effort to consolidate control over the students’ living arrangements. Some of the major reforms have included the dissolution of Central Campus, the switch to random roommates for all freshmen and enforcing on-campus housing for the first three years of schooling. “QuadEX,” which sees that the students of two paired East Campus dorms live together in the same “quad” on West, was simply the most recent reform. The goal is to establish strong social communities ingrained within our student body — think Hogwarts minus the magic, fun and actual formation of social communities. In addition, by obliging that people from the same freshman dorm stay together sophomore year, this will, in theory, facilitate the continuation of friendships. This is where the fallacy lies. Yes, I have certainly noticed many friendships blossom out of my freshman year dorm, but that strong community likely would have formed with or without QuadEX and its two to three sponsored social events a year. The issue is that when we move to West Campus, these communities largely dissipate due to the large size and complex structural organization of the quad buildings. Take the comparison between Southgate and Few. Southgate is three floors, with living quarters concentrated on the top two, and each consisting of one central hallway. There is only one common room in the entire building. Then there is Few, composed of three distinct houses, six floors (with two common rooms on each floor) and a countless number of hallways. The place is an absolute maze. Put simply, people in the same quad do not see each other nearly as often as they did in their freshman year dorm. So let’s say it how it is. This isn’t the Brady Bunch; Duke, and West Campus Quads are not a place where we all sing in harmony. If someone meets their best friend in their freshman year dorm, they should be able to live with them as a sophomore. But in the same way, if someone wants to room with a person from an entirely different freshman dorm, let them. Quite frankly, I am not sure why Duke feels it must intervene in the natural development of friendships. The only thing I can think of is that they simply deem us incapable of forming relationships organically. Perhaps, what they say about nerds is true. We simply don’t know how to talk to people. Ehhh, I don’t think so.At face value, the reforms that have been described in this article will not greatly impact my college experience. I still have an incredible roommate as a sophomore and will likely still have an amazing time during my semester abroad. But what I and many of my classmates would appreciate is the opportunity to make our own choices. I mean, for God’s sake, you took away Nutella! What sick person deprives a populace from Nutella. If a person allergic to tree nuts is smart enough to get into Duke, they are also likely smart enough to know not to eat Nutella. And I can say that as someone who embarrassingly admits to having a peanut allergy (how pathetic, right?).So, all I ask from Duke is to have just a little more faith in your student body. Although we may do some idiotic and outright insane things sometimes, we generally have an understanding of who we are and what works best for us.You don’t have to be a helicopter mom, Duke.

Is science only meant for learning?,Nik Narain,2024-02-22T05:00:00Z,Feb,22,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/022224-narain-science-meaning-learning-20240222.html,"I believe our relationship to science education is overwhelmingly transactional. We sit in a chair, have information presented, imprint it in the old noggin and then are tested on how well we’ve remembered said information. It’s like a file transfer, only most of the files kinda get corrupted or I accidentally drop the USB stick into a puddle of soup. While this form of instruction is not limited to the sciences, it’s most common for teaching big, foundational subjects like calculus, computer science or inorganic chemistry. This is not to assign a value judgment to this form of teaching, because it is extremely direct in telling students what they should get out of a particular course, and has historically prepared students for careers in the sciences and a whole variety of other disciplines. But it pains me when people say they don’t like science because it’s “boring,” because that’s the only way they’ve ever experienced science: as incremental information overload until it becomes less overwhelming. We only turn to science when we’re trying to retain information for a transactional purpose (e.g. a high-paying job or graduation requirements). But is science only meant for informing? And is informing the only way of academic learning? When I think of reasons people turn away from science, or even more serious matters like our nation’s growing Anti-Science movement, one of the core issues boils is human emotion. Education is a service, but it’s also an experience. If that experience is boring, cold or even hostile, why would we engage with it? Not only can the experience of science education be, at the very least, unentertaining for some, but scientific information itself forces a lot of uncomfortable emotions people don’t want. It’s the same reason a lot of people don’t like learning about things like inequality studies or most of American history. When you learn about the pathology of various infectious diseases, their susceptibility and their lethality, you can’t help but feel anxious. When you learn all the doomsday climate change statistics threatening a point of no return for our planet, you can’t help but feel hopeless. When you learn about the endlessness and expansiveness of the universe, and how small and significant the human race is in comparison, you can’t help but feel pretty freaking useless. It’s like the rock scene in ""Everything, Everywhere, All At Once:"" “Who knows what great discovery is coming next to make us feel like even smaller pieces of shit?” But is that science’s fault that we feel that way? After all, science is also the source of so much joy, wonder and curiosity for so many people. When you learn about different animal and plant species, you can’t help but feel a new form of connection with beings that aren’t as different from humans as you think. When you learn about human psychology or neuroscience, you can’t help but develop a better awareness of your own behavior, translating into better self-care practices. When you learn about geology, you can’t help but be like, ""Shoot man, rocks are actually pretty cool!"" And even the emotional discomfort from subjects like pathology or environmental science can be transformed into hope and enthusiasm given the right resources and mentorship.I think when I was younger I liked science because learning it made me feel smart, which then made me feel superior to my peers. I liked the clout; what fifth-grader doesn’t? But I now believe that I like science because I fundamentally enjoy feeling the wonder and awe; I even like feeling the confusion. I like that science in my life is no longer like a file transfer, but a whole new software; not just a reservoir of facts, but an entire framework that has enabled me to navigate the world with a deeper sense of compassion and curiosity. And I hope we can better integrate wonder and curiosity in our science curriculum, in addition to the skill-building, computation and assessment-preparedness components. I hope we can slightly shift the focus from innovation and invention to appreciating what’s already within our natural world. Science is for traditional learning, for innovation, for policy and life-saving products. But it’s also for fun, for pleasure, for self-growth and establishing a deeper connection with the world around us. I hope we can better normalize that.Nik Narain is a Trinity junior.

Words that matter: For Alexei Navalny,Carol Apollonio,2024-02-21T05:00:00Z,Feb,21,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/022124-apollonio-words-matter-navalny-20240221.html,"In some places, when you speak your truth, nobody listens. You may write it down, but it remains readerless in your tear-blotched notebook. Say whatever you want, who cares? It’s just words. Someone (maybe someone like me!) is forcing you to write a paper. Get your little Chat GPT tool to do it for you, blah blah blah. It’s just words. Maybe she won’t catch you and you’ll get an A! And you can take that A and get a job with it. No big deal. Honestly, you might not get caught. Last week I did a live international event that required simultaneous, real-time interpretation into Russian. Afterwards, I looked at the YouTube recording and was impressed by the quality of the translation. When I mentioned this to my host, it turned out, the dialogue was transcribed in English, and then some AI bot-thing rendered into tolerable Russian. Which made me ponder, basically, everything I’ve ever done in my entire life.Fine. As my fellow arms-control interpreters used to say, GIGO: ""Garbage in, garbage out."" But take a breath, please. In some places, the Word matters. It lives in a tangible physical world where when you speak your truth, you will be exiled; dispossessed; brutally beaten; shot dead on the street; poisoned by your own doorknob; imprisoned forever in the coldest place on earth; injected with mind-destroying drugs; tortured in grimy, smelly basements. You might have acid sloshed onto your face, a lethal weapons-grade nerve agent sprinkled into your underwear. Your airplane might drop out of the sky. You will be surrounded by liars, sycophants, criminals, thugs, corrupt bureaucrats and grasping, jealous, venal neighbors — all of them eager to slander, torture and annihilate you.But as we know from Mikhail Bulgakov’s Stalinist Terror-era novel ""The Master and Margarita,"" ""Manuscripts don’t burn."" Your word will live long after they destroy your body.This stuff is real. Speaking your truth in Russia is one of the most dangerous activities known to humankind. But it has generated the world’s most powerful tradition of the written and spoken word: a fierce body of literature that reaches deep into the soul and grips at the conscience. Avvakum was burned at the stake; Dostoevsky was arrested and exiled; Tolstoy was excommunicated; the finest thinkers, poets, writers and intellectuals of the 20th century were arrested, shot, drugged and ""disappeared."" In our time, a mighty wave of Russia’s best creative artists, journalists and writers have been forced from their country — those who have not been assassinated. Countless others will spend the rest of their days in prison. All they did, and do, is speak their truth. You may be given the opportunity to cozy up with the assassins. The rewards are considerable — jobs, public acclaim, wealth, fancy cars, vacations, property, fame, TV time, maybe even the presidency of the USA (blame the Democrats). But you will live on from now until eternity as a ""useful idiot"" (I am a moron) and nothing more. Once you rid yourself of the fears of the moment — that you’ll get a B+ on a quiz, that the Door Dash will be late, that you might fail my class, that your roommate will steal your wallet, that you won’t get your dream job — you will get an exhilarating little rush of freedom. Now imagine that you know that the facts you share will cause you to be separated from everyone you love, to be poisoned, tortured and killed. And you still speak out. You will learn what true freedom is.Speak. The world will listen. So take a moment to understand, appreciate, and commemorate the courageous, brilliant, larger-than-life Alexey Navalny, who died on Friday, Feb. 16, 2024 in a Siberian prison. He exposed the lies and corruption of his country’s leaders, generating ever-more vicious attempts to silence him. They only made him stronger, more confident and more defiant (tell the judge the truth). Now imagine you have just learned that your husband has died alone, far from you and his children. Instead of gathering quietly with them to mourn, you go onstage at a worldwide forum and vow to continue his struggle (what is courage?). What else can you do, but tell the truth?

All the world’s a stage,Anna Garziera,2024-02-21T05:00:00Z,Feb,21,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/022124-garziera-world-stage-20240221.html,"Sometimes, our most spontaneous decisions also prove to be our best. Unexpectedly, my favorite class this semester is the one I was initially unsure about (and the only one I didn’t need to take, given my major requirements). Intro to Performance Studies with Douglas Jones looks at analyzing performance through different lenses. The assigned readings range from lesser-known-20th-century plays to analytical essays seeking to link performance to ritual to its need for human survival. Our class discussions are enough to invigorate me for the week.One of our first discussions raised the question of how far we can stretch the definition of performance, and in doing so, how much we can apply it to our daily life. In other words, was Shakespeare right when, in his play ""As You Like It,"" he called the world a stage?Some argue in the affirmative — that social interaction is to some level an act, a performance, shaped by context and spontaneity.People may react defensively towards this abstract idea: the notion that we might be “acting” for those around rather than showing them our true selves is bold and might even sound outrageous. It has a ring to it that makes us uncomfortable. I might as well have said that we’re in the Matrix.However, the more one thinks about it, the more one finds himself convinced. In some ways, it seems like the only possible explanation. Why else would our daily interactions all be so wildly different? Take the standard corporate office, one that requires all employees to come to work in business casual attire, have meetings in conference rooms and act like real adults — real business adults, ones that are interested in real business things. There is no angle from which we might look at this phenomenon and not conclude that the whole thing is on some level, a false display. While the office creates real profit (although, isn’t money a fabrication in itself?), this pretense is not a true representation of how these same humans would interact together “in the wild.” But what is “the wild,” anyways? Some might call it the bar, and yet even the bar has its own social norms. These same men might act more boldly at the bar, puff their chests to impress the ladies.When we interact with different people (call them “characters”) in our lives, we do everything from shifting our tone, to manipulating our language, to changing our outfits (our costumes?) and even our facial expressions, how we carry ourselves. And it’s not easy to decide which version of ourselves is our “true” self. If there even is such a thing.In fact, admitting that we are multi-faced is so unpleasant. We’d like to believe that we’re honest with those around us. But at the same time, it’s undeniable. If we acted exactly the same around all of our acquaintances, we’d have very few colleagues and even fewer friends. Then, it’s not that we’re not honest with those around us, that we’re not showing them our true selves, but that we’re letting our “character” adapt to different situations. After all, even Macbeth didn’t act the same around the king and around his wife.There might therefore be a middle ground. While we do not act falsely towards our boss by being pleasant on an otherwise groggy morning, we also do not show him all of our true emotions.As college students, we are constantly — to some level — performing. From the way we smile too widely as we say “good morning” to our professors before class, to the way we describe our weekends to our parents on the phone (perhaps leaving out some risky details), to the way we might exaggerate our exertion at the gym to impress those around us, to the way we quickly click to our inbox tab if we sense someone looking at our laptop screen when we were really googling how to spell ""acknowledgment."" We catch ourselves performing when encountering a tour group: We feel pressure to “act like college students,” even though that’s what we are.Yet, subtlest of all, we even catch ourselves performing for ourselves when we’re alone. This can look like pretending to be part of a music video when looking out the car window when it’s raining, making faces at your reflection when you’re brushing your teeth or pretending to hear a crowd cheering as you near the end of a long run as you cross an imaginary finish line. In doing all of these things, we step out of our skins to view ourselves from the outside.When first encountering this analysis, it is easy to go overboard and start believing that everything must then be a performance. However, this is not necessarily the case. While fine, the line that separates interaction and performance is clear: It all comes down to the consciousness of a non-performing self. The moment we become conscious of our duality, we inevitably break the fourth wall, essentially acknowledging our performance. This might for instance feel familiar to bilingual speakers when considering how they feel after pronouncing a word wrong with their “second” accent when speaking with someone with whom they would normally use their first.After all these considerations, it might feel as though performance is inescapable: The more we become conscious of our duality, the more we inevitably put up a performance as we interact with those around us.However much we’d like to always be true to our peers, we should be compassionate towards ourselves. Performance doesn’t always have to involve deceit or exploitation. Sometimes, we feel pressure to perform according to societal standards. Consider the popular 2004 movie ""Mean Girls,"" in which the main character Cady, who initially pretends to be mean to gain acceptance from the “Plastics,” eventually becomes a “mean girl”. Ultimately, she realizes that everyone is simply trying to survive the catastrophe that is high school, finding solace in compromising her original self and performing self into a more mature, genuine self. Importantly, even the “Plastics” felt some pressure to perform “popularity” and “girliness” to establish their spot in the high school social hierarchy.Furthermore, some level of performance is expected in most social situations and straying away from that might work against us. For instance, we as college students should not strip ourselves of our role as “students” and start behaving around our professors in the same way that we do our friends.As college students, we can easily point to all those we’ve met who we felt were being fake. Maybe we’ve even felt that these people were only nice to us when people were watching. If nothing else, this theory of performance in everyday life gives us a new perspective. By accepting that after all we are all just trying to fit in, and that to some level, performing is inevitable in certain social contexts, we can realize that those people we previously labeled as “fake” aren’t necessarily bad people — they’re just trying to make it the best they can. And, perhaps, they’re simply worse actors than we are.Anna Garziera is a Trinity first-year. Her column typically runs on alternate Wednesdays."
Which would you save: Friend or romantic partner?,Jess Jiang,2024-02-21T05:00:00Z,Feb,21,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/022124-jiang-platonic-romantic-love-20240221.html,"Imagine that both your best friend and your romantic partner have fallen into a river. You can save one of them. What do you do?Perhaps you’ve already dived in. But if you’ve got time to think before mortal danger befalls either of them, or if you’re the enlightened kind (like me) who knows that time heals all wounds and thus preemptively watches both get swept away to the land from which none return, then perhaps you’ll spend some time thinking over how we, as a society, view platonic and romantic relationships.First off: What exactly is the difference between the two? Personally, I like to think of friends as separate individuals who have their own lives and romantic partners as … well, the opposite.That sounds bad. Let me explain.I’ve had several conversations with friends about what exactly romantic attraction is. As someone who experiences romantic attraction, the defining difference is that I think frequently and without conscious control about people I like romantically. Think intrusive thoughts, but pleasant, instead of distressing. Romantic love is sometimes compared to an addiction because it involves similar neural chemicals and brain activities. Don’t do cocaine, kids; just fall in love.Perhaps simply because of romantic attraction, romantic partners are drawn to communicate with each other more frequently. I’ll posit that a blurring of identities also results from romantic relationships. Picture a Venn diagram: the one with the circles that don’t overlap represents you and your friend, the one with the circles that do overlap represents romantic partners. This idea is not new. Ever heard the expressions, “You complete me,” or, “You’re my better half,” used to refer to a romantic partner? But is a romantic relationship necessarily better or more important than a friendship? Historically and scientifically, the answer has been no, not necessarily.From the 1700s to the early 1900s, incredibly intimate same-sex friendships were more common, partially because women’s and men’s spheres were so separate and because sexuality wasn’t understood as an identity that could then be stigmatized. Only same-sex sexual acts were condemned — not same-sex desire or affection — so an intimate same-sex friendship wasn’t necessarily viewed with suspicion or prejudice.But as our understanding of sexuality, our expectations around marriage and society itself changed, intimate friendships were deprioritized in favor of intimate romantic relationships.Scientifically, there’s no reason to think that friends are any less important than romantic partners. Research shows that spending time with friends improves mental health more so than spending time with a spouse and that people are happiest when they’re with their friends and their spouse, not just their spouse.Friendship comes with health benefits too. Large social networks are more effective than either exercise or dieting alone in decreasing the risk of premature death. A six-year study of Swedish men in their 50s found that having friends decreased the risk of heart attack and death from coronary heart disease, while having a partner did not. For older adults, social isolation is comparable to smoking, obesity and physical inactivity in increasing the risk of premature death from any cause. On the other hand, loneliness is associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety and suicide. That’s not the best of news, given that a U.S. survey found that in general people have fewer friends today than in the past, with the share of respondents reporting that they have no close friends rising from 3% in 1990 to 12% in 2021. And yet, as a society, we value romance over friendship. The discrimination against single people is not just subtle or social, but also legal and financial. There are more than 1,000 U.S. laws that benefit only married people, affecting Social Security (which is primarily subsidized by singles based on the assumption that they will eventually marry), taxes (married couples can save thousands of dollars just by filing jointly), and health insurance. One article roughly estimates that the cost of being single is a little over $1 million over a lifetime assuming a fixed salary of $80,000 (about $1.32 million and $106,000 today, respectively) and a little under $500,000 assuming a fixed salary of $40,000 (about $641,000 and $53,000 today, assuming 2013 dollars). In comparison, there are no similar legally recognized unions for committed platonic friends. That’s not to say that you can’t marry a platonic friend (which would be quite queerplatonic of you), but simply that the legal recognition of only romantic partnerships (i.e. marriage) discounts the similar importance of close friendships and contributes to a not-even-false belief that romantic relationships are more valuable than friendships (on the order of a million dollars, lifetime).Love for a friend is different from love for a parent, which is different from love for a child, which is different from love for a romantic partner. But love shouldn’t be hierarchical, with romantic love as the pinnacle transcending other types of love. Yet, by cultural and institutional metrics in the U.S. — from legal discrimination against single people, to common phrases like “more than friends” that imply that friendship is characterized by a lack rather than a plenary, to the arophobia inherent in the assumption that everyone who is single would like to eventually be in a romantic relationship when some people simply don’t experience romantic attraction — it kind of is.So, who do you save, the friend or the partner? Instinctively, you’d probably save the one you love more and would miss more, regardless of whether that love is romantic or platonic in nature. Logically, though, I’d advise you to go for the one who’ll net you those sweet, sweet married tax benefits.Jess Jiang is a Trinity senior. Their column typically runs on alternate Wednesdays."
Closing Duke's Herbarium: A fear of long-term climate commitment?,Matthew Johnson,2024-02-20T05:00:00Z,Feb,20,Letters To The Editor,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/022024-johnson-closing-duke-herbarium-20240220.html,"I am shocked and saddened by the plan to close the Duke Herbarium — one of the most important resources in my Duke experience from 2002 to 2013. For my honors thesis, I collected mosses in the North Carolina swamps, and my work study was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to digitize herbarium specimens. It was a transformative experience to see the natural world beyond the classroom, and it launched me toward my current position as a professor and herbarium director. I see the passion among this generation’s college students to solve the major climate and biodiversity challenges we face. Yet, while worldwide interest in collections as a tool for climate research is rising, Duke is removing its herbarium from campus and diminishing its students' preparation to be the future leaders we need to address the climate crisis. Duke’s decision contradicts a pillar of its own 2023 Climate Commitment: “Prioritize investments in climate research.” Yet, with a donor available to help save the herbarium, Duke did not launch a campaign to maintain Duke’s global leadership in biodiversity research (fitting the Climate Commitment). Instead, Duke signaled that this type of contribution is unwanted. The NSF should also be concerned: After sending millions to Duke for the curation and digitization of the Herbarium, their investment is now null and void. Rather than being “good for the collection,” closing the Duke Herbarium signals that collections are temporary and will dissuade future investments globally. Finally, Duke will be erasing an internationally recognized generational legacy. As a graduate student, I was surrounded by Ph.D. research at the leading edge of biodiversity science in plants and fungi. In just the 10 years that I was at Duke, over two dozen Ph.D. students who actively used the herbarium are now faculty, lead researchers and curators training their own students based on what we learned at Duke. Without the Herbarium, and support for future faculty in biodiversity research, Duke’s reputation in this area will wither on the vine.Dr. Matthew G.

Happiness is not what you’re looking for,Paul Dilly,2024-02-20T05:00:00Z,Feb,20,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/022024-dilly-dont-look-for-happiness-20240220.html,"Editor's Note: This article contains descriptions of eating disorders. Happiness: that good feeling when you ace a difficult exam or find a friend in the person you’re sitting next to in class. But that’s all it is — a feeling, nothing more. Like all feelings it comes and goes, flitting out of one mind and into another; trying to hold onto it, contain it, only drives it away. Its elusive nature spurred me to pursue it relentlessly.As a general rule of thumb, middle school sucks. For me, it was no different. I had wrestled with severe anorexia beginning toward the end of my fifth-grade year, losing 20 pounds — after starting at a healthy weight — before my mom forced me to see a food therapist on threat of hospitalization (I was scarily close to that point). As I finally gave in to my body’s aches and began my recovery, I felt as if I were taking a step backward. The fatigue I’d felt building up in my bones — I had ignored it in an attempt to convince my mind that starving myself was ok, that I could still function without food — overwhelmed me. I spent the remaining part of my summer couch-ridden, too drained to walk to the neighborhood pond.By the time school came around, I was still largely incapacitated: I remained in a constant state of exhaustion, and I struggled to focus due to lack of mental clarity and common migraines. But I was not one to miss a school day (I was the kind of kid who tried to convince his parents he wasn’t sick), let alone a month or year, so I mustered my courage and decided to go for it. Boy, did my young self need to be brave.Teachers scolded me for eating in class — even though I’d received special permission from the principal — and classmates ostracized me for sitting out during PE. Looking for a distraction, I turned to my studies, funneling all I had into my schoolwork. By the end of each day I had no effort left to give, but I came home full, satisfied. I was proud of myself for fighting so hard, and I took comfort in knowing I could still do something well — could still do good for myself — despite my health complications. As I continued to invest myself in my classes, my grades climbed higher than they’d ever been. Don’t get me wrong: I’d always been a solid student. I’d just never applied myself to my studies with such vigor. I felt like it was all I had left, and I was treating it as such — and reaping the benefits, too. Teachers and classmates took note of my success; they began to see and treat me as “gifted.” At first it was validating; I was being recognized for my efforts, sometimes even by those who had previously mistreated me because of my special accommodations. Then came the expectations.What had before been something for myself — I was studying hard for my own good — now felt as if it had been released to the world. And the world wanted so much: advanced classes, club leadership, academic competitions, blah blah blah. I wanted no part in the blueprint laid before me, yet I began to internalize it. The pressures of the world became voices in my head. They sucked away my contentment, filling the void with desire and ambition. They screamed at me to take advantage of my talent, to not let my giftedness waste away. Eventually, I listened. Good grades were no longer enough; now it mattered what everyone else got too. Every class award I failed to bring home was fuel to push myself harder the next year. Eighth grade was my year: I won all the awards. But by that point, I didn’t care. I was already too focused on high school to notice. Over the years, I grew to expect more and more of myself, hoping each bullet point I added to my resume would be the one to reassure me I was good enough, to fill me with the happiness I believed came with greatness. That comfort never came — I wouldn’t let it. I feared taking the time to acknowledge and celebrate an accomplishment would turn me soft, harming my ability to accomplish more — and (theoretically) be happier — in the future. So instead, I filled my time with more to-dos, more goals to strive restlessly for. The boiling pressure within me to discover something meaningful through my grind self-perpetuated an endless spiral of torment: the unhappier I was, the harder I worked, and the harder I worked, the unhappier I became. With each day I was driving myself further into the ground. My relentless drive is the reason I’m here at Duke. But it is also the reason I almost had to leave it behind.Last semester was a clean slate: I had stored up a bit of energy from a slightly less work-filled summer and shed the responsibilities I’d forced myself to endure throughout freshman year. My course load was its hardest yet — I was taking only higher-level STEM classes — yet I held onto hope that I would go easier on myself this time around. It started off well. My classes were tough but manageable, and I enjoyed the content I was learning. When approached with opportunities, however, I couldn’t refuse — how could I pass up on another shot to fill the void inside me? I accepted a job tutoring student-athletes. And then a leadership position on a research project. And then a part-time role at a tech startup. Suddenly I was inundated with more pressure to perform than ever before, my dreams of starting fresh dashed within weeks. With my new commitments, I was working constantly. Out of necessity I shut down other areas of my life, canceling on friends and skimping on meals, showers, classes. Sleep was an afterthought, and the ZZZs I did manage to catch were filled with dreams involving problem sets and email drafts. I locked myself in random classrooms, not leaving until I completed what I felt had to be done. In the rare moments where I wasn’t actively working, I could think only of all the work ahead of me. There was no reprieve. Yet I had done this to myself, willingly, and I wasn’t about to give it up, no matter what. At least, that’s what I thought ….Throughout my semester slog I developed malaise. I tired easily, and my muscles ached; I attributed it to a cold I couldn’t shake. As my symptoms worsened, however, I knew that wasn’t the case. I pressed on, telling myself I just had to make it to the next break and could rest then. Deadlines don’t stop when classes do, though, and I found myself filling my “time off” catching up on projects and clocking hours. Despite being back in my own bed, there was no rest to be had. When I returned from Thanksgiving break, my mysterious sickness exploded within me. Tiredness morphed into fatigue deeper than I thought possible; aches settled into a stiff numbness. Walking felt like wading through water; I thought I might need a cane. I ate and ate, searching for the energy I needed to escape the living corpse I was trapped in. Yet I felt nothing — my stomach was a black hole. Any attempts to work devolved into staring blankly at my screen, my cognitive abilities blocked by a mental fog too thick to sift through. Deadlines and obligations gave way to survival. It was all I could do to sit there. My self-neglect had caught up to me, some primal instinct shutting me down before I could wreck myself further. I had been brought to my knees, and I could only watch as the world I had built up over the last decade came crashing down. There was nothing left to shield me from the truth. My truth. I was not — and could never be — enough. Unless I quit the chase and gave myself a chance.What I had disguised as a quest to better myself, to find the lasting happiness I was missing, had instead been an all-out war between who I am and who I could be. I had torn myself down in the present to build myself up in the future. But I understood now that such a future could never be realized — not in that way. The only way to be content with who I could be was to be content with who I am, right now, in this moment. It was then that I began to reconcile the pieces of me — and with it came peace that was better than any happiness I could have found in my pursuits.As humans, we have an innate ability — known as hedonic adaptation — to quickly adjust in response to life-changing events (whether good or bad), enabling us to maintain a somewhat stable level of happiness regardless of our circumstances. Encouraging as it is to know we have a built-in emotional homeostasis to fall back on, it can also have unintended consequences — ones I often fall prey to. On the days that are particularly hard, all I want is to not feel so terrible. I attribute my current unhappiness to feeling bad, thinking good health will remedy my dissatisfaction. Yet when I feel better I take my health for granted, worries about making it through the day superseded by worries about what I’m going to fill my day with. I feel no happier, no lighter, despite having the good health I wanted so desperately the day prior. We think we know the cure-all for our pain; when we taste the medicine, though, it does nothing for us. We hinge our contentment on what we think we need, rather than what we have. The world doesn’t make us unhappy. We do. I lost so much last December: my health, my purpose, my drive, my identity. But those dark moments spent staring at walls and blinking away the days forced me to sit alone with myself and confront who I was, without the accolades and abilities by which I’d come to define myself. I was hurting and exhausted and scared, unsure of what might become of me … and I was okay with that. I had to be — broken me was all I had left. I accepted myself, at my worst and most vulnerable. Despite everything, I thought, I am enough.For 10 years, I refused myself this peace. I toiled and writhed in denial of myself. But you don’t have to do the same. You may never be enough for this world — parents may disapprove of your major, companies may scoff at your resume, professors may ignore your FLUNCH requests — but you can be everything to yourself. And that is all that matters. Let go of the mistakes. Let go of the expectations. Let go of the fears that strangle you. Just be. There is so much opportunity in the current moment, if only you have the courage to embrace it. I dare you to plunge headfirst into the spectacular now and let the current of life carry you. Wherever you end up, I promise you will not be disappointed.Paul Dilly is a Trinity sophomore. His column typically runs on alternate Thursdays."
The fear of being single,Heidi Smith,2024-02-19T05:00:00Z,Feb,19,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/021924-smith-being-single-fear-20240219.html,"Valentine’s Day is my least favorite holiday. No, it’s not because I’m single and bitter — only one of those is true, you can guess which. Sure, the blatant, unethical consumerism of cut flowers and foil balloons, sketchy additives in candy hearts, and general lack of recyclability of gift-wrapping materials are bad, but these problems aren’t unique to Feb. 14. My main issue lies in the societal fear-mongering and hetero- and mononormativity — the privileging of opposite-sex and monogamous relationships, respectively — of it all.No matter how progressive we Duke students like to think ourselves, we are not immune to traditional ways of thinking that are ingrained in our societal consciousness, particularly as they pertain to romantic relationships. They deeply disadvantage and discriminate against people who are not romantically coupled, both financially and socially, particularly when seen through the lens of intersectionality.Just take a look at things like The Marriage Pact. Even though we don’t really take it seriously — particularly as evidenced by The Fluke News’ spinoff — the underlying anxieties associated with it have real heft. The idea of a marriage pact is far from new, and we seem to have chosen the age of 30 as our absolute last chance to find a — let’s be real, first — husband or wife. Even my own mother was accused of succumbing to these fears by marrying my father at age 29.Sure, none of us will ever marry our Marriage Pact matches, right? And certainly not our Fluke ones! But there’s enough curiosity in it that many people at least grab lunch, if not become one of a few who enter a long-term relationship with them. We surely take it more seriously than those random QR codes that showed up on campus a year or two ago in which you could put the emails of any fellow students with whom you would want to hook up. Even if you won’t admit it, you secretly hope you match with someone good in The Marriage Pact, because it could lead to something our society sees as desirable.We can’t help but care about the overall goal of obtaining a mate because that’s just what we’re supposed to do, and anyone who thinks differently is choosing to go against the grain. But it shouldn’t have to be this way. Not when getting married is like a coin toss as to whether death will truly be the reason you do part, and divorces are common because one partner is doing something harmful to their spouse. I’ll spare you from enumerating my other grievances with the traditional marriage path.Sure, romantic relationships can be good — sometimes, for some people. But we need to rethink the idea that all people want to have one right now and that all people even have an orientation allowing them to desire those sorts of connections — after all, the A in LGBTQIA+ is not just for ally. When we see all long-term romantic relationships as the ideal, a set of unhealthy assumptions is propagated throughout our world.When we see finding a boyfriend or girlfriend as the monolithic ideal, those within long-term relationships are not forced to think critically about the efficacy of their partnerships — because at least they aren’t single. From my observations, most relationships between people of our age are net negative or neutral for one or both participants. Additionally, it’s unnervingly easy to make a not-great relationship look ideal. I can count on one hand how many people I’ve heard talk entirely positively about how an ex treated them once they’ve broken up. It’s kinda like how you can’t complain about, say, not getting paid enough for a summer internship to your friends who are still looking for one, because at least you have a job, even if there’s something bad about it.But it truly is better to be single than to be in a bad relationship. Because being single doesn’t mean being alone unless you choose to make it that way. It’s no hot take that investing in platonic friendships is amazing, and I’ll even defend the ever-critiqued situationship. As long as both parties know what they’re in for and act ethically towards each other, we shouldn’t villainize someone for not wanting to date another person in the traditional sense. Dating-dating is a lot of work, and considering how busy we all perennially are, it can be healthier and more fulfilling to have something less easily definable. Sure, some people find labels useful, but they also come with a slew of external expectations.I’ve found Duke students to be strangely hesitant towards non-traditional relationship formats, considering how ardently many of us support gay rights — well, at least the rights of queer people whose relationships mirror those of heteronormative ideals. Yes, things like non-monogamy or dating across racial lines are met with discomfort, but it’s the small stuff, too. For example, people just assume that if I spend a lot of time with a guy friend, regardless of his sexuality, that we’re boyfriend and girlfriend. Maybe something like that isn’t inherently harmful, but it just shows how blind we are to relationships that at all operate outside of our norms, however antiquated our standards may be.If we questioned the efficacy of traditional monogamous relationships as much as we did with less serious ones of sexual and/or romantic varieties, I don’t think we would give them as much merit as we have been. Are we really afraid of being alone, or are we just afraid of being perceived as such? Are the artifices surrounding the concept of romantic love so ostentatious because people feel so strongly about their significant others or because they feel like they need to prove that they do? What would happen if we all thought a little more closely about why we see the act of being single as a bad thing?Heidi Smith is a Trinity senior. Her column typically runs on alternate Mondays."
CS Majors launch 'ambiguous and labelless relationship' pact ,Monday Monday,2024-02-19T05:00:00Z,Feb,19,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/021924-monday-monday-relationship-pact-20240219.html,"It’s the week after Valentine’s Day, and perhaps you — like thousands of other students at Duke — are still single and contemplating if you’ll ever be loved. You are not alone: Marriages are in decline. Birth rates are down. Depression and isolation are at record levels in the United States. In 2023, the US “epidemic of loneliness” was declared a public health crisis. All around, people are more disconnected. But never fear — as always, a group of Duke CS majors has developed a solution. “Many have tried and failed to solve the problem of loneliness at Duke — the Marriage Pact, the Fluke Marriage Pact, the K-Ville Marriage Pact — but they’re missing the point,” junior Getsmahd Bintches says. “Marriages are out. Ambiguous, mutually-frustrating and labelless relationships are in. It’s time to update our algorithms.”Bintches is one of three students that has developed the Blue Devil Situationship Match (BDSM) Program. The program follows the classic Duke formula for happiness: tests and interviews. Unlike traditional Marriage Pact tests, the BDSM Program involves open-ended questions analyzed by AI to better match you to the perfect non-exclusive, uncommunicative, not-committal partner. The test includes such fun questions like, “Why do you believe you, of all the people in the world, deserve to be at Duke?” and, “What will you do if you can never satiate your craving for approval from your parents?” The BDSM Program also requires a 24-hour video of a day in your life, your astrology sign and a urine sample. In the spirit of inclusivity, the program will also include an option for existing “happy” couples that are looking for a third, “you know, just to see what it’s like."" “We believe everyone at Duke deserves to match with someone they can click with, even those who stay in loveless relationships because they fear change and being alone,” said Bintches. Students who take the assessment will be given a generated report complete with their match and a CAPS-Sponsored assessment on their biggest insecurities. The report will also include a step-by-step instruction guide on how to initiate contact with the match, and later, how to ghost them. Helpful tips include “message them once every few weeks with a ‘wyd tn?’ and then don’t respond.” To incentivize the participation of heterosexual men who are historically underrepresented in the “Pact” pools, the BDSM Program promises men who sign up two partners instead of one. The program is one of many developments around campus to address the feeling of loneliness. Aang Player, a sophomore who is also working on the program, recently co-founded the incredibly successful Duke Polycule Club.“The tides of relationships and sexuality are changing,” Player said. “We’re trying to meet that demand. In the Duke Polycule Club, anyone can try the non-monogamous lifestyle and at least they’re being honest about it.” “I thought I was signing up for a study group for Chem 101,” said one student who wished to remain anonymous for fear of backlash from his current situationship. “But it's been great so far.”Monday Monday is concerned that their beloved partner, Pincent Vice, may be cheating on them by reading other opinion columns. Please restrain yourself from sending any sexy or flirtatious messages to them during this sensitive time. "
Save the Duke Herbarium,Henry Van T.

It was with disbelief that I learned that Duke had decided to no longer support the Herbarium.Herbaria are key resources and repositories of biological information that are constantly mined in new and previously unforeseen ways to address key scientific questions regarding biodiversity and its loss and the impacts of climate change. They represent a valuable, irreplaceable asset. The Duke Herbarium is such an asset, and its loss would be to the detriment of Duke’s reputation as a leading scientific research university.I spent 10 years volunteering in Biology at Duke — including supporting the Herbarium. Never did I imagine Duke would make the short-sighted decision to drop the Herbarium.Imagine Duke deciding to close the libraries — this decision to no longer support the Herbarium is of the same magnitude.My hope is that Duke will reconsider this decision in the interest of both science and Duke itself and most importantly to future Duke students.Dr. Henry Van T.

What Duke can learn from retiring ex-president Ricardo Lagos,Robert Carlson,2024-02-16T05:00:00Z,Feb,16,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/021624-carlson-ricardo-lagos-20240216.html,"When you think of Duke’s notable alumni, who comes to mind? Maybe it’s Tim Cook, CEO of Apple. Or Melinda French Gates, the co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. You might picture basketball legend Grant Hill or comedian Ken Jeong. Ricardo Lagos, the former president of Chile who retired from public life last month, probably isn’t on your list. But maybe he should be.In Duke’s 100-year history, only two alumni have gone on to become heads of state. One is Richard Nixon, whose 1937 J.D. from Duke Law most students would rather forget. The other is Ricardo Lagos, a largely overlooked alumnus whose life should inspire Duke students, faculty, staff and alumni throughout the next 100 years.Ricardo Lagos’ LegacyLagos obtained his Ph.D. in Economics from Duke in 1966. Boundaries between disciplines and careers were less strict back then; even while writing his Duke economics dissertation, Lagos taught as a visiting political science professor at UNC-Chapel Hill. He would spend the following two decades applying his expertise to where it was needed most, whether it be government, academia or the United Nations.When the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet came to power in 1973, Lagos and his family fled to Buenos Aires. But he later returned to Chile, risking death by publicly criticizing Pinochet on national television and leading the campaign for democracy. Though Lagos would have attracted massive support in the subsequent elections, he instead backed Patricio Aylwin, who was better positioned to negotiate a peaceful transition from authoritarianism.Lagos spent the next 10 years in cabinet roles before running successfully for president in 1999. Lagos’ moderate governing style surprised many voters who feared radical change from the Socialist Party leader. But Lagos was an institutionalist above all else, and his careful balancing of market-oriented policies with a strong social safety net placed him firmly in the tradition of Chile’s post-1990 consensus. He left office in 2006 with an approval rating around 70%.In the years following Lagos’ departure from office, Chile maintained its strong institutions, but cracks emerged. Presidents Michelle Bachelet and Sebastián Piñera alternated in power for 16 years, exacerbating political polarization. When Lagos launched a new bid for president in 2017, the country and his coalition had moved on: He garnered only 5% in polls before bowing out.Polarization has exploded since then. 2019 brought a cycle of violent protests and police repression. 2021 saw an election between the most left-wing and most right-wing presidential candidates since the restoration of democracy. Through it all, Chilean voters have careened from left to right, backing dueling constitutional reforms and then rejecting both of them. The country could use a leader like Ricardo Lagos right now.Knowledge in the Service of SocietyMuch has been written about Lagos’ legacy in Chile in the wake of his retirement and after the recent death of former President Piñera. But the Duke community should also consider what Lagos’ life of public service means for us.In 2006, Duke issued a new strategic plan that included “knowledge in the service of society” as one of the university’s “enduring themes.” The Kenan Institute for Ethics hosted a roundtable the following year to define this theme and debate its implications. In the years since, Duke developed signature programs like DukeEngage to directly translate academic knowledge into societal change. Larger trends, however, have undermined this goal. With the exception of the Focus cluster, the phrase “knowledge in the service of society” has largely disappeared from Duke.The most significant ways for Duke to put knowledge in the service of society are not through one-off programs, but rather through encouraging Duke alumni toward careers where they can make a difference and incentivizing Duke faculty to produce research with real-world relevance. Neither front looks promising.Around 30% of the Duke Class of 2022 opted for a career in consulting or finance — in line with figures from other elite colleges. For newly minted graduates, consulting and finance offer a prestigious path of least resistance. Even when students are making the best choice from an individual perspective, an alumni class of Goldman Sachs analysts and McKinsey associates hardly contributes to Duke’s mission of knowledge in service to society — whatever the benefits it might offer for the university’s fundraising goals.When it comes to encouraging research with practical significance, Duke faces additional challenges. Foundations, philanthropists and governments invest in scholarly research because they believe it will make the world a better place. Medical science helps us live longer, healthier and happier lives. Civil engineering helps us build more affordable, more sustainable and safer structures. The social sciences offer insights that allow policymakers, organizations and individuals to make better decisions.Through their appointment, promotion and tenure policies, Duke administrators set a framework that can either encourage or discourage faculty from exploring the real-world implications of their work. These policies should not force academics to explore practical research topics or share their findings with a mass audience. Many research papers simply do not have practical implications but are still valuable. Others involve preliminary or contradictory results, and widespread circulation risks overstating the evidence. At the same time, however, Duke should reward scholars who want to share their findings more widely — especially when these findings could have real-world implications.Duke’s current tenure framework does the opposite. In most departments, the most important factor in determining tenure is the number of peer-reviewed publications a junior professor has written. This publish-or-perish dynamic does not count articles written for a mass audience. It does not count time consulting for nonprofits or private industry. A book published with an obscure academic press will help an aspiring full professor, but a bestseller that shapes major policy decisions? Forget about it.Certain departments are taking steps in the right direction. Duke’s political science department stands out among political science departments at elite colleges for encouraging public-facing engagement. The Sanford School’s Embark Program does excellent work helping students identify alternative career paths in public service. Both offer models for how the university can rededicate itself to knowledge in the service of society.Learning from LagosRicardo Lagos graduated from Duke at a time before publish-or-perish, before academic disciplines became as siloed as they are today, before the rise of on-campus recruiting. He weaved between sectors and disciplines before being elected as president, leaving a social impact greater than even the most successful consultant, banker or tenured faculty member. Very few Duke graduates will have the tremendous legacy that Lagos was able to achieve. But over Duke’s next 100 years, we should aspire to the qualities that Lagos reflected. We should build institutions and cultures that encourage public service. And we should be more willing to take risks in our own careers that reflect our values.Robert (Bo) Carlson (T’20 Political Science and Economics) is a current master’s student at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), where he focuses on Latin America."
The merits and pitfalls of lines,Nathan Luzum,2024-02-15T05:00:00Z,Feb,15,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/021524-luzum-merits-pitfalls-lines-20240215.html,"It’s no secret that Duke students love waiting in line. I’m not the first to make this observation, but the more I walk around campus, the more lines — literal and metaphorical — I see. Sure, some of this is intrinsic to dense spaces, as there are bound to be queues for dining halls or buses or other services that many people want at the same time and can’t have all at once. But there is something special about Duke and lines. Maybe part of it has to do with that psychology experiment in which they made kids stare at a marshmallow for 15 minutes with the promise they’d get a second one if they could resist the temptation to eat it. Waiting requires cultivating one’s appreciation for delayed gratification, an attitude that students have certainly had to embrace in their pre-Duke years to be admitted. Perhaps we subject ourselves to the pain of waiting in line out of the belief that an experience must be earned to be fully enjoyed. I mean, who else but Duke students would draw up a nearly 50-page manual about how to wait in a line? (Disclaimer: by no means am I mocking this — in middle school, when I thought some of my relatives were exploiting loopholes in board game rules at holiday gatherings, I drafted an addendum to the rulebook and circulated it among family so that people would be advised that their tricks wouldn’t work next year. It is no wonder why I’m always in high demand to attend exclusive gatherings.)Sometimes, it’s not even clear why people are waiting in a line. There are days when I stroll down the Bryan Center Plaza, see a bunch of people filing up to a table, and figure why not? I’ll get in line because it’s probably something pretty good, like Monuts. Even a clicky pen is passable. If you and 10 friends started a fake line that led to nothing, some people would still probably join and stand there for a while before realizing that they’d been duped. To some extent, your desire to jump into a line stems from the assumption that the person ahead of you knows something that you don’t. Why else would they be there? This supposition, however, can be troublesome.I was waiting for the self-checkout at Target the other day and saw a station that seemed to be open but that no one was using. Most people just trusted the person ahead of them, assuming that the area was out of order or off limits. Eventually someone ventured to go ahead and start scanning items, questioning the wisdom of the line. The station worked just fine. Evidently some past bystander — acting either out of ignorance or using since-outdated information — had neglected that particular checkout area, causing a ripple effect where everyone else tacitly assumed they couldn’t use it. Of course, it’s worthwhile to mention that most of the time, people are right and bucking the line won’t get you ahead. But sometimes, a healthy dose of skepticism goes a long wayIn medicine, I’ve noticed quite a bit of metaphorical line-following, as trainees usually do things because that’s the way they’ve seen other people do them. Again, in general, this is good. Medical students shouldn’t be giving out new antibiotic regimens for diseases in which there’s already an effective, well-established treatment. In the same vein, nobody wants to be operated on by the surgery resident who has a new trick up their sleeve that they’ve been waiting to try out.But sometimes it’s good to pause and ask ourselves why we do what we do. It’s one thing to look at medical practices from centuries past and shake our collective heads at treating ailments with some blend of leeches and cocaine before modern-day knowledge of microbiology and pharmacology came along. It’s another, though, to examine more recent practices and realize that some very outdated ideas were held as medical gospel not too long ago.One famous example of this is Dr. William Halsted’s radical mastectomy, first popularized in the 1890s. The technique — performed on patients with breast cancer — not only removed breast tissue but also eviscerated nearby lymph nodes and muscles to extensively remove the cancer. Radical mastectomies were frequently used to treat breast cancer for the better part of the next century until people started to question whether the extent of the operation was really beneficial. And at the end of the day, though much of the decision-making depends on the extent of the cancer, studies showed that radical mastectomy offered no additional benefit compared to less disfiguring surgeries in many patient groups. They are rarely performed today.Other examples — big and small — abound in medicine. There’s even a campaign called Choosing Wisely that points out perfunctory tests or practices that offer little benefit. Medical training is about blending a rapidly increasing amount of knowledge with the relatively fresh outlook of someone who hasn’t done the same thing for years on end. Veteran clinicians have indispensable wisdom accrued over years of patient care, but it’s always worth re-examining long-held practices to ask if there’s a better alternative. Lines are ubiquitous and unavoidable, literal and metaphorical. Next time you find yourself in an ambiguous line, it might be worth thinking about whether the person in front of you really knows something you don’t — or figure out what you’re waiting on in the first place.

Do you really love me?,Advikaa Anand,2024-02-15T05:00:00Z,Feb,15,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/021524-anand-do-you-really-love-me-20240215.html,"I’ve always been disturbed by how casually people will say “I love you.”I was first struck by the increasingly callous social attitude towards this phrase when I downloaded Instagram for the first time. There, nestled in the comments, I spotted various iterations of the phrase when someone left a compliment on another’s post: “love you,” “ily” and “i <3 u” were the most common. “But you barely talk to this person,” the voice inside my head whispered when I read such epithets.Such contradictions were abundant. I found that people would casually drop the “love youuu” in text messages when they wanted something I could give them — class notes, homework help, food, fleeting emotional support — yet, their actions rarely mirrored their words. These same individuals would become strangers in the school hallway, walking past me without so much as a glance of acknowledgment. Maybe that’s why vocal professions of love ring hollow to me unless they are backed by action — because showering someone with praise and admiration one day and then casting them away from your graze the next, I know that cannot be love. When I transitioned to college, I found that the words gained more meaning when it was said by those living near me, as we buoyed each others’ spirits through the difficult toils that inevitably dawn during one’s first year of college — navigating challenging academic work and the struggles of managing responsibilities on your own for the first time.Words are important to me. As someone who loves to express the tides of her soul with the seductive power of words, I weigh words heavily. A letter holds the power to transform a word; a word holds the power to transform a sentence; and a sentence holds the power to transform someone’s life. Simple criticisms — even those uttered jokingly — can grip my mind in the throes of nighttime, haunting me with agonizing musings over my self-worth, while compliments made in passing can induce new passions swallowing my free time.And so, when I find that people’s words don’t match their actions, I am disturbed. Because I love words. And sticking by your word is love. As I am growing older, however, I am discovering that people love in different capacities — that sometimes when people say “I love you” but forget the little things, they’re loving me in the best way they know how. But that love doesn’t always feel like love to me. As I reflect on my perceptions of love, I think many of my beliefs are rooted in the fact that I grew up in an immigrant household, where love was rarely in the air in a typical sense. Tied down by the anxieties of simply making it another day and carving a life in an unfamiliar place from where home was so far away, my parents didn’t have time for grand professions of love. Yet, I could feel the love everywhere. It was abundant in all the little things they did — all the feelings of warmth and affection that they left unsaid, yet not unconfessed.I could feel the love in the 16-hour plane trip that my dad took on my sister’s sixth birthday to surprise us. I could feel the love in the journal my mom bought for me, decorated with turquoise blue birds and bright pink flowers, when she discovered that I liked to write I could feel the love in the way my little sister stuffed her head into my side, hiding from the camera as she wobbled through the awkward bends of being a girl. The love we experience from our families lays the blueprint for the love we seek as fulfillment throughout the rest of our lives. This love is the love that teaches us how to feel love, how to give love and how to receive love. Often, we find ourselves yearning for the love that we see in other’s lives. Maybe a friend’s parents are taking her to her dream vacation spot for her birthday. Or maybe her sister showers her with hugs and kisses all the time, like you so wish yours would do. And when we look back into our own lives, we feel empty and deprived. Yet, I find that often, our struggle rests not in the fact that we are unloved but that we are unable to understand the multitude of ways in which we are loved. I don’t mean to imply that our individual needs and desires have no merit. Of course, you should communicate openly with the people in your life if their actions are consistently falling short of honoring your self-worth. But this Valentine’s Day, I challenge you to meet the people who love you where they are. Make the trip to visit your grandmother this summer, as you’ve promised to do for years. Drink the concoction your sister invents when you come home. Watch the romantic comedy your best friend keeps begging you to see with her. Because love is everywhere. And it’s up to us to feel it in the air.Advikaa Anand is a Trinity sophomore. Her columns typically run on alternating Thursdays."
"Love, love",Gabrielle Mollin,2024-02-15T05:00:00Z,Feb,15,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/021524-mollin-love-valentines-day-20240215.html,"There are approximately 7,117 languages in the world, marking approximately 7,117 different ways of expressing a feeling that connects people of all ages, races, genders and backgrounds across the world: love. The Greeks have four different words for four types of love: philia, for friendship; eros, for romance; storge, for family; and agape, for unconditional love. In Arabic, there are eleven stages of love: from initial simple attraction, or “hawa,” to a final maddening, irrational love, or “huyum.” Spanish famously has te amo to say I love you. But also, there exists a more casual te quiero and the verb encantarse, to love. Yet, in English, there is simply love. Initially, I found English’s singular word for love unfortunately simplistic. While other languages embraced love for its complexities and boundlessness, devoting valuable linguistic capital to properly expressing the expansiveness of the feeling, English tethered love to one basic four-letter word. In comparison to many other languages, linguists have remarked on the lack of appreciation and exploration for the feeling of love in the English language. I’ve come to realize, though, that this seemingly underdeveloped vision of love has created a culture that expresses love far more freely and frequently than its global counterparts. While the singular word love may seem like a shallow cop-out when put up against vast global exploration of love in all its forms, this simple word has given English speakers a perpetual outlet to feel love in many ways. Within this one four letter word is a culture teeming with love, readily expressed. You can love your parents. You can love your sibling. You can love your partner. You can love Duke, or your classes, or your college friend group. You can love Kraft’s milkshakes and the pumpkin bread from Café. You can love when Duke beats UNC (GTHC). You can truly love just about anything in a language with a singular word for love, even love itself. Though somehow, in this culture that linguistically promotes constant expressions of love, many remain fixated on one singular form of love — romance, of course. It is the most glamorous form of love, after all. With chocolates, roses and dinner dates galore, it's hard to deny the universal enticement. But by fixating on romance — and romance alone — we forget about how much love there really is out there.And isn’t that a shame? It’s the day after Valentine’s Day, and likely, at least half of the world spent the day in resentment of the holiday. Why? Because somehow in a culture that is constantly expressing love — from the most serious of romantic partners to best friends to valued material goods — we have denied the legitimacy of love beyond romance. And oh, how much love that is to neglect!Even further, we also tend to believe there are “right” and “wrong” ways to fall in love. Years of rom-coms and TV romances have conditioned us to believe in a singular idea of love. We yearn to fulfill classic tropes (“friends to lovers,” “enemies to lovers,” etc.). We crave the thrilling “chase,” ultimately desiring feeling “madly in love” with “the one.” But love is not this formulaic. Love is expansive and multi-dimensional and, most importantly, undefinable. It can feel like butterflies in your stomach but it can also be comfortable, warm, and stable. As long as it's real and honest, there is no right way to fall in love.So, as we move onwards from this year’s Valentine’s Day, I hope you remember just how limitless love can be. There are endless ways to love, to be loved, to witness love and to spread love. Love is so much more than one word in the English language, and love is so much more than romance. Love is the joy you feel catching up with an old friend. Love is the selflessness of mothers for their children. Love is even the kindness of the stranger who held the door just a little bit longer for you. Love is just about everything, everywhere, all of the time. Now, love it!

The Allen Building Takeover: The second founding of Duke University,Theodore D. Segal,2024-02-13T05:00:00Z,Feb,13,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/021324-segal-allen-building-anniversary-20240213.html,"Author’s Note: Feb. 13, 2024 marks the 55th anniversary of the Allen Building Takeover by members of the Duke Afro-American Society, an event that President Price has described as “one of the most pivotal moments in our university’s history.” Duke describes its Centennial as “a historic opportunity to recognize Duke’s extraordinary past, communicate the impact of the present and look toward the potential of Duke’s future.” How will the Duke Centennial acknowledge and celebrate the Black students whose protest changed the school forever? The excitement was palpable when James B. Duke’s 1924 gift transformed struggling Trinity College into Duke University. W.P. Few, the president of Trinity College, told students that they would have an important part in “launching one of the great education establishments of the world.” The Trinity Chronicle reported that ""land would be acquired and buildings constructed adequate for an institution of learning that in time will rival Yale or Harvard.” “Duke 100” — the university’s year-long centennial celebration — will rightfully honor James B. Duke and the other men whose philanthropic work set the foundation for Duke University.These founders had great ambitions for Duke, but their vision was narrow. They set out to create a premier university catering exclusively to all-white administrators, faculty, students, trustees and alumni. Segregation and Jim Crow infused every aspect of campus life. Duke excluded all Black students, as well as Black faculty and administrators. Duke Chapel, Duke Hospital, Page Auditorium, the dining halls, dorms, the football stadium and the golf course were segregated. Laboring under what they called the “Plantation System,” Black workers held the vast majority of low-wage positions. These workers “were treated as sub-humans,” labor organizer Oliver Harvey recalled. ""People were absolutely afraid. . . . I never worked at a place as bad as Duke or as racist."" The Carolina Times, Durham's leading Black newspaper, wrote accurately in 1959 that working at Duke for Black people was like “peonage.”Many point to the arrival of five Black undergraduates at Duke in the fall of 1963 as the moment when Duke turned away from its Jim Crow foundation. While indeed historic, this was not the case. Forced to admit Black students because lucrative federal and foundation grants would stop if it remained segregated, Duke hardly changed in response to the arrival of Black undergraduates. The university adopted an “assimilationist” model of desegregation: Black students were admitted to Duke, but the university would not change. Black students had one option, Duke President Douglas Knight described: “Come in, be white.” Duke “didn’t realize that integration meant they had to make some changes, too,” Black student leader Chuck Hopkins commented. To him, the administration acted as if “bringing [Black students to Duke] was like bringing the natives into civilization.”It was Duke’s Black students who forced the university to change. Likening the experience of arriving at Duke in the Sixties as “being cast into a foreign, alien world,"" these students encountered racism at every turn. In 1967, a group of Black students formed the Duke Afro-American Society and began to make demands of the university. What were they asking for? Changes that would make Duke a place where they too could thrive. They called for more than one Black undergraduate professor, a Black student advisor, a Black Studies department, a ban on the Confederate flag and the playing Dixie at sporting events, a summer transitional program for incoming Black students, more Black students, dedicated space for a Black student union and — critically — better treatment for Duke’s non-academic employees. Duke resisted change. Looking back years later, Knight believed that the university’s initial refusal to respond to Black student concerns was due to the deep ambivalence many felt about desegregation. According to Knight, many at the university believed that, “Once we have admitted Blacks, what more do they want?” As Knight recalled, “Around me, the attitude was, ‘What’s the hurry?’”On Feb. 13, 1969, at precisely 8 a.m., approximately 50 members of the Duke Afro-American Society entered the first floor of the Allen Building and occupied the registrar’s and bursar’s office. Risking their personal safety and professional futures, they sought to force a definitive negotiation around their demands.University leaders appeared unmovable. Within 60 minutes after learning of the occupation, Duke leaders decided to issue a one-hour ultimatum to the students: vacate the Allen Building, or be ejected by force. By late afternoon, Durham city and county police, as well as national guardsmen, had converged in Duke Gardens, and 1500 people had gathered on the quad. Armed with guns, Billy clubs, tear gas and pepper spray, law enforcement marched on the Allen Building in the gathering dusk. Inside Allen Building, Black community leader Howard Fuller had a stark warning for the students. “The guard’s going to come in here,” he told them, “They’ve got weapons. . . . You are going to be a bunch of dead people.”The Black students left through the front entrance to the Allen Building as police were breaking down the back door. Although the occupation was over, a police riot ensued. With the Black students gone from the Chapel Quad, police battled white students for over an hour. One student reported seeing police striking “everything in their path.” “I remember thinking at the time that I wouldn’t be surprised if the police actually started shooting people,” another student recalled. “They were so angry.” “Kent State could very well have happened at Duke,” Black student Bertie Howard thought. “I think the potential was there.” By the time it was over, 19 people were admitted to the Duke Hospital Emergency Room for injuries suffered during the melee.The Allen Building Takeover and the events that followed changed Duke forever. “The occupation of Allen Building was one of the most pivotal moments in our university’s history,” President Price told participants on the 50th anniversary of the protest. “In the actions that you took, you forever shifted our sails toward the prevailing winds of justice and equality. . . You have forever changed this place for the better and improved the lives of many who followed.”In this centennial year, we will celebrate James B. Duke and others who have laid the groundwork for the university. But we must also honor the Black students who risked everything to occupy the Allen Building 55 years ago. These students forced the university — after decades of resistance — to turn from its Jim Crow past and start on the path to a vibrant, internationally renowned future. They are the founders of the Duke University we know today.Duke describes the Centennial as “a historic opportunity to recognize Duke’s extraordinary past, communicate the impact of the present and look toward the potential of Duke’s future.” Hopefully, Duke will use this “historic opportunity” to fully acknowledge and celebrate the central role the university’s first generations of Black students played in launching the school on its trajectory to greatness.Ted Segal is a Duke alum (T’77) and is a member of the Duke Library Advisory Board and the Advisory Council of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Duke.

The cold never bothered me anyway,Anna Sorensen,2024-02-13T05:00:00Z,Feb,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/021324-sorensen-cold-never-bothered-me-anyway-20240213.html,"A few years ago for Lent, I decided that I would give up hot showers. For those unfamiliar with the practice, Lent is a 40-day period where Christians give up something important to mirror the temptation Jesus faced from the devil. Who doesn’t love a long, hot shower? I certainly treasured the time to steam and relax in utter bliss. Mind you, Lent began at the end of swim season too, so I could’ve definitely used a hot shower after hours in a freezing pool in March. It wasn’t easy to turn on the cold jets of water and quickly wash my hair every day, but I truly felt good about my commitment by the time 40 days had passed. Last semester, I learned that my roommate had been taking cold showers since she returned from her DukeEngage in Ghana where hot water was unavailable. I’m proud to report that she is still going strong! I consider myself relatively disciplined, so I wondered if I could put myself up to the same challenge. For the past month or so, I’ve started off small with a cold shower roughly three times a week. It may not be much, but it’s a start.Before I continue, there’s something you should probably know about me that helps explain why I decided to go down this route. I have always been obsessed with cold water. I literally wrote my Common App essay about swimming in the ocean in the winter. Here’s an albeit cheesy (gag) excerpt about floating in the January water: “My mind clears, and I let thoughts come and go, in and out, like the waves on the shore.” After years of polar plunges, I’m someone who not only loves the thrill of this adventure but also knows a lot about the benefits of cold water on mental and physical health. Many societies throughout history have recognized the benefits of cold water exposure. Scandinavian cultures (shoutout to my Norwegian ancestors!) celebrate cold immersion through daily fjord dips and polar plunges. Plenty of studies point to cold water’s ability to lower our anxiety and redirect our focus. Over time, cold water’s triggering of electrical impulses from peripheral nerve endings to the brain has been linked to a decline in depression. Also, cold water is better for your hair and skin! As you can see, there are many scientific reasons why you should take cold showers. Moreover, I don’t think the connection between cold showers and shorter showers is a difficult one to make. From a personal standpoint, think of the time you could get back in a week by decreasing the time you spend in the shower. Saving just five minutes on a shower every day gives you over half an hour back by the end of the week to catch up on assignments or your favorite TV show.From an environmental and cost perspective, cold showers have huge benefits. Did you know that standard shower heads use two and a half gallons of water per minute? By that metric, a 10-minute shower uses 25 gallons of water. That’s about equivalent to 200 coffees from Cafe! Standard costs for water stand roughly at 37 cents for a 10-minute shower, with an additional six cents for heating costs if you want hot water. This may not sound like a lot at first, but consider the impacts on a larger scale. What about shower costs at Duke? In just one bathroom, I’d estimate 20 showers take place every day. Assuming we average a 10-minute hot shower (which, let’s be honest, is probably an underestimate), the total cost per day for one bathroom comes in around $9. For an academic year with roughly 28 weeks of the semester, it reaches $1700. If we apply these numbers to our undergraduate population of 6,640 students, it turns out we are spending $2,888 per day. Over the course of a year, that total reaches $566,126. This estimate comes from assuming we all shower once a day. That’s probably not true. Moreover, a total of $566,126 relies on the hope that Duke showers all have “standard” shower heads; less efficient shower heads have a higher flow rate, thus using more water per shower. I mean, when’s the last time anyone checked on the Bassett dorm bathrooms? So, what would it look like if we transitioned to colder, shorter showers? If everyone took a five-minute shower with cold water for the next academic year, we would save roughly 16,268,000 gallons of water. Duke could also save $322,106. Maybe they could put that money towards a new method to fix our lawn that didn’t involve ripping up the entire ground for a whole semester! I digress. Let me be clear: I know this scenario is highly unlikely. I’m not suggesting that everyone switch over to a cold shower every single day, but I hope this research gives you a sense of the possible impact and scale of one of the decisions we make on a daily basis. In one of my classes last semester, we discussed the difference between individual and collective choices toward combating climate change. It can be exhausting to consider the scale of destruction facing the environment today and intensely frustrating or anxiety-inducing to feel like there is nothing we can do about it. Individual actions like cutting back on water use may not feel like such a big deal, but they do add up. More than that, they can help us feel more confident in our ability to affect change and address the problems we see in our world. So, next time you get to the shower, take a second to pause and think. Do you really need that twenty-minute steam? Wouldn’t you just love to have a healthy glow on your skin and hair? Won’t you feel a little good about your contribution to water and energy conservation? Besides, take it from a veteran. The cold is only a temporary discomfort, and it will wear off the second you reach your room and cozy up in comfy clothes. If nothing else, you’ll appreciate your sweats more than ever.

What QuadEx needs to be great,Nicholas Chrapliwy,2024-02-13T05:00:00Z,Feb,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/021324-chrapliwy-quadex-20240213.html,"The poetic art of naming things is old and difficult. If you’re familiar with a certain cosmic creation narrative, it may even be considered the first act of mankind after receiving the breath of life. But while you may think the long and storied human experience in naming things would mean we find it easy, you have only to look at Duke’s nascent residential model to find a potent example of how difficult it seemingly remains. “QuadEx” is a name, often loathed, for something that receives plenty of attention at Duke University. This attention is often given by its undergraduate body, who sees it mostly as a failed reform of Duke’s housing and social life, prior iterations of which they have only heard rumors. The criticism comes in repeated waves as students take their intended steps into the social life of the university and end up falling painfully into the gaps where communities and programming of prior eras used to be. QuadEx was strategized as a way to fill those gaps and create a powerfully sustainable and inclusive way of giving each student at Duke a ground floor of belonging. But the critics are overwhelmingly correct — the reform has not lived up to this ideal after years of implementation, and students have little reason to believe that it ever will. I remain deluded enough to believe there is still a significant possibility of success, with the right model leading the implementation. This column is a presentation of that model. In advance of presenting, let me tell you briefly where the model comes from and why I’m writing about it. My first semester at Duke was the fall of 2017, several geological eras ago when Central Campus was not merely an archeological stratum beneath a parking lot but a thriving third campus. Greek organizations and SLGs had sections on West Campus and Central Campus, and no one was wearing a mask save the premed students shadowing surgeons. In the span of a few years, several important changes took place: President Richard Broadhead became President Emeritus, and Vincent Price arrived on campus in 2017. West Union was renovated, reopening in 2017 with a terrifically long name no one uses (The Richard H. Broadhead Center for Student and Campus Life). All the yearly traditions taking place there moved to Central. Central Campus was deconstructed and paved over in 2018, burying decades of vibrant campus life, social tradition, and student belonging. Duke Students for Housing Reform made a lot of demands of the University in 2019. Almost none of them were heeded. The COVID-19 pandemic plagued Duke from 2020 to 2021, halting the annual transfer of significant social structure knowledge from one generation of Duke students to another.Greek life largely disaffiliated from the University and moved off campus. Duke launched QuadEx in the fall of 2021. Throughout all these changes, I was struggling with orgo problem sets and joining the Next Generation Living and Learning Committee (this unwieldy title compels me to again reference the poetic art of naming things, etc.). I worked with students from all different backgrounds and a now-closed consulting firm on how to meet the demand for housing reform and address the changes that took place over the past few years. This was in the fall of 2021, as Duke was announcing the linkage of East Houses with West Quads and calling it a name taken from Stanford’s ResX program. I loved the work and believed in the mission, so much so that I became a Spark Fellow after graduating to work on implementing the strategy of that Committee full time from June 2022 to July 2023. It was during that year of work on implementing QuadEx that I was often compelled to think critically about how to explain what we were doing, because all the prior efforts to communicate it to students and other stakeholders were absent or ineffective. After my fifth lap walking around the legacy Willow Oaks lining Abele Quad, I had an epiphany. The best way to explain how QuadEx could be great was right in front of me.QuadEx starts with the most fundamental identifier students share no matter who they are: the place they live, specifically their first year East House followed by their linked West Quad. Shared space is the core of this QuadEx model, just like a sapling tree’s core forms the substance around which all its future rings concentrate. But a sapling core is not a mature tree, and even though that part of QuadEx has been fully implemented, shared space is not enough to build a ground floor of belonging where all students feel at home at Duke no matter their background or identity. A flourishing, mature version of reformed housing and social life needs many more rings. I think we have to start with at least three. During the year I worked on implementing QuadEx strategy, I was able to successfully get the first level tree ring off the ground and running in the form of the Quad Arches. Strategically, Duke needed a set of shared signs and symbols that constituted a shared identity derived from shared space. It was my suggestion in the Neighborhood Identities Committee report to do so using heralds like many of our peer institutions do, but very early on we flipped the heraldic shield to a gothic Arch. Filling the Arches with their ten elements took several months of research and deliberation with the teams of brilliantly engaged students who made those choices, and then several more months of illustration by a local artist. Each symbol is a toolkit for identity, operable for a wide range of uses and designed so that the only thing necessary to participate in using them is to live in your Quad. Taking a look at any brand or sports logo will give you an idea of how important a shared symbol is for creating shared identity, and all the moving parts of the Arches act in concert to achieve that. I won’t drone on; you can read more here. As much as the Arches were my darling project, I know for certain that if you have a pretty symbol but you don’t do anything with it, the social program is still immature and likely unsuccessful. Shared activities and experiences are required to give life and story to the symbols, which is why they form the second ring around the core of this model. I spent several months planning the Quad Cup concurrent to designing the Arches, sketching out a way that we could take all the things students already did and stitch them together around the Quads to create a ground floor of shared activity. Whether in academics, athletics, arts or community engagement, students would be able to earn points for their Quad and scheme to win the Cup, sharing the experience of hoisting a physical trophy at the end of year and keeping it in their Quad until next year’s winner steals it away. None of this materialized in spring 2023 when it was intended to, but through the efforts of some incredible students and staff, it seems like it launched this spring. I’m hopeful it flourishes as more students step up to lead its charge. Shared spaces, symbols and experiences are much more robust ways to build community than any single element alone, but just doing things under the same banner as individuals leaves a cratering gap in the model. For the activity to be meaningful and sustained, the individuals engaging in them need a way to relate to the other players, just like Duke Basketball needs players, coaches and fans to make a good game. This is where the third ring, the Quad Societies, operates. Some Duke students enroll with a built in network of fantastic connections they are blessed to have through parents or friends, but others arrive not knowing a single soul. For the undergraduate Quads to have a ground floor of belonging where everyone can stand at the same level in growing a network, QuadEx needs groups of stakeholders connected to the Quads who do activities with them and build relationships. If you’re a sophomore interested in law, business, or medicine, you happen to be at a place that has professional schools for all three professions. But beyond the variable success of cold emailing, how can you connect to these groups of students, and how can you ensure they want to connect to you? The Graduate Society of each Quad would consist of graduate students from every school at the university who self select to connect to undergrads, joining them at Quad Cup events and building organic relationships that make learning about applying to medical school easier, especially for the students with the least amount of privileged access to the process. When I met with the Graduate and Professional Student Council last summer, there was genuine enthusiasm for this on the part of the grads — many of them want to connect just as much as the undergrads do. What if you’re not interested in more school after graduating? The Alumni Societies would apportion the vast alumni network of Duke University into affiliation with the Quad they lived in during their years here (or with one they just happen to like). Inviting them to attend Quad Cup events and sharing the Quad Arches full of symbols they already know because they lived there would make the process of organically forming professional networks more possible and more equitable. A first attempt at this was made during the Reunion Weekend Bricks to Stones Parade, and the alumni database has already added where someone lived at Duke to their profile. These are small steps, but they are easily buildable. Finally, the Faculty Fellows program has already demonstrated the immense value that student faculty relationships produce, and should be expanded to include many more faculty who elect to affiliate with a Quad and join them at events to meet students through a Faculty Society of each Quad. When else does a biology major get to meet an economics professor? Or a physics major an English professor? Several of our peer schools do something like this already, so proving the concept isn’t necessary. We just need to do it. And while we’re at it, finding a way for the staff who make this place run to participate in Staff Societies would not only give them closer insights into how students actually live today, but also give students a better sense of how Duke works and how we can change it for the better. The Quad Societies have no current implementation plan as far as I am aware, but for QuadEx to be successful, a ground floor of shared networks and relationships is fundamental. There is a possible fourth ring, and while I think it’s the most important to the longevity and success of the model, it’s the one least likely to be implemented. Sharing space, symbols, experiences and networks can sustain a communal identity fabulously, but for such an identity to evolve over time while maintaining a continuous center, shared stories and memories are crucial. The Quad Books would be a database of current student activities, victories, losses, challenges and mischief that can be a rich trove for future cohorts. Once students become alumni, they leave a lot of hard-earned knowledge about how to navigate Duke just floating through the air with no place to pass it off. Writing stories about experiences at Duke and submitting them to the Quad Books would pass that knowledge down as future students return to the Books again and again to learn how Duke students of the past got through this place. Like recounting the Exodus story at Passover each year, students can feel like they are experiencing past versions of Duke themselves and gain just as much as the ones who wrote them. Duke University already possessed much of this structure and programming before 2016, operating in a variety of different forms, but operating nonetheless. Greek organizations continue to attract students because they are able to offer shared space, symbols, experiences, networks and stories in ways that no LLC or Quad can (yet). Duke also used to be a much more homogenous place, and before it rests on the laurels of cultivating a much more broadly diverse student body than it had in prior decades, it needs to address the fact that a heterogeneous student body requires much more intention to build community. When everyone at Duke looked and acted the same, building community happened naturally because of a built-in shared identity made possible through bigoted exclusion. Making significant progress in removing those exclusions has fostered a diverse student body, which definitionally does not naturally share many identifiers. That’s why we need to plant the seeds and cultivate some. My hope is that Duke will have the bold leadership and creative vision to grow those seeds into some mature and flourishing evergreens so that QuadEx may one day be a name for something beloved and lasting. Until then, students, alumni and other university stakeholders should continue to be critical and insist that we can do better. I know I will.

Attention is most of all you need,Angikar Ghosal,2024-02-12T05:00:00Z,Feb,12,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/021224-ghosal-attention-all-you-need-20240212.html,"When was the last time you read 500 pages uninterruptedly? My friends have told me I possess a remarkable speed in reading, and indeed, I have thanked fate for having that skill. However, I must candidly concede that my propensity for sustained focus and my capacity to digest 100 pages in succession have somewhat diminished since starting college at Duke. There exists one culprit to which I ascribe this decline — the pernicious grip that smartphones exert upon my life, as opposed to my earlier school life in India. In middle and high school, the possession of any form of mobile device — even a rudimentary flip phone — was strictly prohibited within school premises. It was not until my enrollment at Duke that I opened an account on Instagram or Snapchat. Thus, before college, my cognitive faculties remained untainted by the influx of abbreviated video content, encompassing TikTok videos, Instagram reels and YouTube shorts. Whereas our previous generations succumbed to the intellectual erosion caused by serialized television dramas, the deleterious impact of sub-10-second videos on contemporary cognitive faculties far surpasses the former. It is amazing how much of our student life has become contingent on our smartphones. Even meals are paid for at WU by ""tapping the phone."" Look, I love using my laptop to write out assignments in LaTeX on Overleaf; however, there are occasions when I entertain the notion that my entire educational journey should not be so intricately linked to my personal computing device. I yearn for assignments that require handwritten, timed essays, devoid of any online resources. Furthermore, I advocate for a reduction in the reliance on calculators within mathematics and physics courses. The influx of technological advancements in the United States typically reaches India after a discernible time lag. Thus, I am part of the last generation of India who remembers the times before smartphones attained omnipresence. During the mid-2000s in India, success in competitive collegiate entrance examinations hinged upon factors such as accessibility and availability of preparatory resources. Currently, such resources are readily accessible and downloadable from the internet — students now have a problem of too much material to choose from. Consequently, the quintessential determinant of success or failure in examinations has become something completely different: The ability to not get distracted. Henceforth, each academic cycle will create successive cohorts of 18-year-olds who will rue the squandered hours on Instagram instead of dedicating more time to limits, continuity and differentiability. If only I had refrained from watching videos featuring recurrent refrains such as ""Bones"" by Imagine Dragons, ""Polozhenie"" by Zedline or ""Tourner Dans Le Vide"" by Indila! I am not a technophobe; indeed, I recognize the internet as one of the greatest achievements of civilization, and I duly appreciate the educational utility of platforms such as YouTube, particularly for learning concepts in programming. Nonetheless, I do condemn the pervasive spread of ‘short’ content. No one can learn Docker or Kubernetes through a five-minute video, let alone an under-60-second video with the AI voiceover and generated subtitles. The most efficacious instructional materials on YouTube tend to span approximately one hour each — akin to the duration of a lecture at Duke itself! Personally, I feel happy about my marked enhancement of reading, writing, and understanding mathematical ""proofs’""during my undergraduate tenure — a skill in which I used to harbor self-doubt as a first-year. Foremost among the catalysts for this transformation is my exposure to lengthy, intellectually demanding fiction, such as from Tolstoy and Krasznahorkai. If one can mentally keep track of the intricate web of relationships among ten different characters from ""War and Peace,"" or the convoluted syntax of a postmodern novel in one’s working memory, then one is better equipped to conceptualize the full structure of propositions, lemmas, theorems and corollaries from a paper published at the Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC). If you are struggling with finishing readings for a Philosophy class, go try reading Dale Purves’ ""Neuroscience."" It will help. The paper that kicked off the generative artificial intelligence revolution is called “Attention is All You Need.” The analogy between the pivotal role of attention in machines and its significance for humans merits contemplation, despite the irony that we are using what we know about machines to better understand humanity. Could it be possible that an individual's perceived level of confidence — or, conversely, their lack thereof — in a particular academic domain hinges upon their ability to sustain a coherent trajectory of thought without succumbing to interruptions? This gives more reasons to be frustrated at any product or service whose profitability relies on exacerbating the erosion of attention spans — entities thriving on fostering prolonged periods of engagement characterized by a state of cognitive suspension and the perpetual cycle of mindless doom-scrolling. Your attention span was taken from you. Every time you get a five-second story update on Instagram, the electrochemical stimuli cause specialized neurons in the ventral tegmental area to release dopamine into the nucleus accumbens. My maximalist friend asked me to continue this paragraph with further intricate descriptions of biological phenomena in a blatant attempt to increase the literary poignancy of the description of how short-form content alters the brain and the way dopamine regulates rewards and addiction. As per my friend, the contrast would come out better if one sentence had ordinary English such as “when you want to relax a bit and be happy,” and the sentence following that overstimulated the reader by cramming in references to the pedunculopontine nucleus, gamma-aminobutyric acid and substantia nigra pars reticulata.For space constraints, I only kept the first sentence — you can infer and interpret the inductive implications of the intended ideas.I have found scientific literature on artificial intelligence from the 1980s and 1990s remarkably beneficial for this self-introspection. Such papers tend to be written in a more informal language. If you want to learn how to learn, go read the early papers of Yaser Abu-Mostafa, David Rumelhart, Rodney Brooks or Jurgen Schmidhuber. How information theorists and early scholars of machine learning have formalized, modeled and structuralized notions of learning and meta-learning have helped me learn how to learn better and helped me learn how to learn how to learn better. Technological accelerationism devoid of introspection effectuates irreversible transformations in societal structures, cultural paradigms, and axiological frameworks. I fully concede that such paradigm shifts are often inevitable. Yet I ardently beseech: resist for once, refuse for once, while fully being cognizant of the eventual futility of your actions. Consciously, I have endeavored to disentangle numerous facets of my existence from my smartphone. Possessing an Android device devoid of an NFC chip ensures I do not use a mobile DukeCard. The cyclical release of new Apple products every two years elicits considerable enthusiasm among my peers, yet serves to fortify my resolve to eschew entanglement with the Apple ecosystem. The appeal of Vision Pro eludes my comprehension. I carry physical cash in most places — throughout my undergraduate years, I have had less than four Venmo transactions. During housing preferences, I prefer quads where my room is locked and unlocked by traditional physical keys, as opposed to DukeCard access. Of course, I still carry my smartphone everywhere. One can cut down on calories and eat healthier without abandoning meals altogether.

"Black History Month, Valentine's Day and love",Luke A. Powery,2024-02-12T05:00:00Z,Feb,12,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/021224-powery-love-practice-resistance-20240212.html,"Every year, Valentine’s Day is during Black History Month; the two are not necessarily related but I do see a connection: love. This is not a sentimental love focused on heart candies with sweet messages (wonderful as they are). In the context of Black history, which is a human history, the love I am thinking of comes from those human beings who endured the fiery brutality of slavery because of the color of their skin — those who came through the blood of the slaughtered, weary years and silent tears. Theirs is a tireless love to live.I’m thinking of their love because love endures and I’m here because of their trail of tears that form a pillow of love I rest on. Their love left us a lasting legacy in word and song: “Above My Head, I Hear Music in the Air;” “There is A Balm in Gilead;” ""Oh, Freedom;” “Wade in the Water.” These lasting love songs of faith, hope and endurance speak to a nature of love that we may not often consider.To love in a hateful context — as was theirs — is a form of resistance to hate. Take for example the sermonic scene in the clearing of the woods in Toni Morrison’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “Beloved” — a fictional narrative account of a former slave’s memories of post-Civil War Ohio. In this scene, there is an “unchurched preacher” named Baby Suggs Holy, who preaches from her “heart” to her fellow enslaved despite having “busted her legs, back, head, eyes, hands, kidneys, womb and tongue” through the furnace of slavery.Listen to her sermonic love song:“‘In this here place, we flesh; flesh that weeps, laughs; flesh that dances on bare feet in grass. Love it … Yonder they do not love your flesh…. Love your hands! Raise them up and kiss them… You got to love it …! … Flesh that needs to be loved. Feet that need to rest and to dance; backs that need support; shoulders that need arms, strong arms I’m telling you … love your neck; put a hand on it, grace it, stroke it and hold it up. And all your inside parts … you got to love them. The dark, dark live r— love it … and the beat and beating heart, love that too.’”To love one’s flesh, one’s body when others want to destroy it is a practice of resistance — resistance to demonization and ultimate destruction. It resists that which seeks to hate or destroy or judge. Love isn’t a judge but rather the joy of life. It resists death because its breath is life, which is why ancient wisdom tells us that it is stronger than death. Love seeks to live and breathe and allow others to live. So, when you love another or yourself, you are saying, “I want you to live” through your actions. You are saying, “Even if I must die, I will love because I believe in life.”Love is a practice, an action — not just a mood or feeling. It is something you do, you show, you incarnate, over and over again if it is genuine. You sing it. You speak it. You enact and practice it in some way. It is not mere thought or philosophy. It is embodied through head, heart and hands.Even the children’s character Barney the Dinosaur — from the children’s television show “Barney & Friends” that my children used to watch — knew this based on his theme song:“I love youYou love me We’re a happy familyWith a great big hugAnd a kiss from me to youWon’t you say you love me too?” Even for Barney, love is action. In his case, it includes hugs and kisses. Love is something that is done.Roses or chocolates may be fine as gifts for Valentine’s Day this week, but a real gift you can give someone or yourself is to show through action that, “I want you to live.” With all the specters of death in the world and in our city, to love may be the best gift you can give this year.Do it for our human ancestors. Do it for the world. Do it for life — your life and everyone else’s.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel. His column runs on alternate Mondays."
Elko Urbanism: The end of an era?,Aaron Siegle,2024-02-09T06:29:00Z,Feb,9,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/020924-siegle-elko-urbanism-the-end-of-an-era-20240209.html,"And in a blink of an eye, it was all over. After a season full of so much hope, everything fell apart with remarkable speed. Less than 24 hours after a triumphant victory over Pitt, Blue Devils football coach Mike Elko stepped on a private jet headed for College Station, Texas, to sign a contract as the new Texas A&M head coach. Soon after, a cascade of Blue Devils hit the transfer portal, making it clear that the Elko Era was officially over. Those happy memories of storming the field after knocking off Clemson, getting hyped for College Gameday and savoring back-to-back bowl victories are now all things of the past.But perhaps the most remarkable achievement of the Elko Era happened off the gridiron: Elko got Duke students to care about football. This is an impressive feat given the global nature of Duke’s student body, where most students couldn’t distinguish a touchdown from a safety before their arrival to Durham. A large part of this success can be attributed to the upgraded gameday experience, with fans treated to a lively tailgate party in Card Lot before each home game. Duke students found that what makes football special has more to do with family, friends and food than first downs.The sun may have set on the Elko Era, but that doesn't mean his innovations should die. First and foremost, keeping the Card Lot open to student festivities would be an apt tribute to Elko’s legacy. The Card Lot, ideally situated between Wilson gym and Crowell quad, divides a heavily trafficked pedestrian route. Furthermore, Card Lot could satisfy the long-standing desire for an on-campus social venue. The expansion of the tailgate experience to all home sports games — not just men’s football — would help boost attendance for other hard-working athletic programs. Finally, transforming Card Lot into a pedestrian first, low-cost and informal community space could serve as model for other quick-fix urban innovations.Let’s call it Elko Urbanism.Ever since the demolition of Central Campus, student groups have lacked an on-campus venue to host events, leading many organizations to relocate gatherings off-campus. While many want to return Central Campus to its former grandeur, Duke seems to be in no rush to redevelop the barren piece of property. To fill this void, a temporary pavilion-like structure could be erected over Card Lot to host social functions. This space could be rented out to student groups through SOFC, reducing the risks associated with late-night Ubers after parties. The Card Lot pavilion has numerous advantages as a social spot over Central Campus. It’s right on West Campus, involves low capital costs to set up and leaves Central Campus open for exploring other development opportunities.But wait, Duke surely doesn’t need another event space, right? After all, Duke Gardens is just a stone’s throw away.The revitalized Card Lot would fulfill a different need than Duke Gardens is designed to serve. While Duke Gardens has made significant outreach efforts to Duke students, students are not the Garden’s main target audience. Don’t believe me? Then take a look at the Garden’s policies. No frisbees (or any other sports equipment), no scooters, no riding bikes, no hammocks, no alcohol, no ‘amplified music’, no entry after dusk, and no tables or chairs. This essentially eliminates all of Duke student’s favorite social activities. While these rules are meant to preserve the bucolic ambiance and natural ecosystems of the Gardens, they disqualify the Gardens as a student social space.How about parking, what would happen when people lose their parking space?At Duke, your parking spot says a lot about your social status. If you’re Coach K or a basketball player, you get to park in the centrally located Card Lot. If you’re on faculty, you’ll usually have a designated parking lot right next to your building, such as the Allen Lot or the Fuqua Faculty Lot. But if you’re a grad student, you’re stuck in the remote Science Drive Garage. The problem is that Card Lot is where the upper echelons of Duke society park, most notably, the Iron Dukes.The Iron Dukes is a de facto booster club for Duke Athletics, a way of funneling wealthy alumni’s money back into Duke’s athletic success. But there’s a catch. In return for their generosity, highly philanthropic donors ($100,000+ per year for Champions Society Level) get first dibs on Men’s basketball season tickets and priority parking in the Card Lot. This poses a challenge for pre-game tailgates that can’t fit in K-Ville.Fortunately, Duke is blessed with an abundance of parking lots. Under 0.1 miles away is the Sanford Faculty Lot. Not much further than that are the Whitford and IM Lots. In short, there are plenty of other places where the Iron Dukes can park without degrading their game day experience. Clearly, Elko’s team was able to negotiate a solution to free up Card Lot before home football games — when demand for parking is at its highest. I see no reason why this same compromise can’t be implemented more often.Finally, the conversion of Card Lot to a student event space would align with the principles of Duke’s Master Plan. The Master Plan states, “Duke should be a walkable campus supported by an understandable circulation system.” The plan goes onto state that Duke should have a pedestrian core surrounded by circular arterial routes on the periphery, limiting the flow of through traffic. And this is largely true. For example, one can walk all the way from Edens Quad to the LSRC without ever having to cross a street. However, there is one notable intrusion into this pedestrian zone: Towerview Road.Towerview Road slices through the heart of West Campus, forcing pedestrians to cross between the residential quads and athletic complex. However, the center portion of Towerview Road only serves one destination: Card Lot. By rethinking Card Lot as a park for people instead of a parking lot for cars, Towerview Road could dead-end at Wannamaker Drive in the south and Union Drive in the north. This would eliminate unnecessary traffic that interferes with a bustling pedestrian thoroughfare.Space on campus is valuable, and Card Lot is just too centrally located to be occupied by cars. Turning Card Lot into a student event space could solve multiple problems at once, including a flagging on campus social life, barriers to pedestrian mobility and a lack of interest in certain Duke sports teams. Though Elko may be gone, Elko Urbanism should live on.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity sophomore. His column typically runs on alternate Fridays."
The danger of casual psychopathology,Nik Narain,2024-02-08T05:00:00Z,Feb,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/020824-narain-danger-casual-psychopathology-20240208.html,"“That TikTok left me depressed.”“That dinner was traumatic.”“I’m so OCD about my closet.”“These cookies are addictive.”“I’m such a workaholic.”“Sorry, I just get bipolar about these kinds of things.”The drive towards mental health awareness over the past decade has prompted vast discussions on the subject in news, social media, film and television. And I think it’s safe to say in a zeitgeist-y sense that at this point, we are all “aware” of mental health issues, especially as young people and especially as college students. In fact, psychiatric language has become an increasingly common part of our vernacular, to the point where we throw around terms about addiction, depression, anxiety, trauma, narcissism and many others in everyday conversation. I call this kind of language “casual psychopathology” — creating a strange juxtaposition between words with strong clinical charge in contexts that are usually mundane. Saying that your last midterm “gave you PTSD.” Calling your frequent mood swings a “bipolar” act. Although this language aims to normalize mental illness, it actually ends up trivializing its severity. It creates a misleading perception that these conditions are fleeting feelings rather than complex, debilitating disorders. Moreover, this kind of language is usually used to describe or justify some sort of “negative” behavior (e.g. nervousness, organizing things, needing a break), which is not only a misappropriation of the term but also a perpetuation of negative stereotypes surrounding mental illnesses.Mental health professionals not only have the job of being successful healers but also adaptive wordsmiths (emphasis on the “DSM”). In psychiatry, language is the only tool for individual diagnosis, and often language is the only form of treatment. When the language around mental illness is misused, the entire system of care suffers as a result. When we dilute words like “depression,” “trauma” and “PTSD” — especially in contexts we know are intended to be sarcastic or comedic — these words begin to lose their clinical context, a phenomenon known as semantic satiation. As a result, we collectively generate more barriers for individuals to access treatment and worsen a mass confusion and distrust in a system that is designed to help people. I say all this critically, but I also say it hypocritically, as I’m completely guilty of doing this myself. And I know I do it because it’s the most accessible language I have for others to understand what I might be experiencing, even if I know I’m breaching scientific misinformation. And I know equitable access to mental healthcare is still a complete crapshoot, leaving most people to digital resources for their own self-advocacy. And I also know that the language of mental illness is inherently subjective; for example, what is considered “traumatic” for me probably won’t be traumatic for someone else. And then I fall into the cognitive rabbit hole of questioning, what do any of these words even mean? Who gets to decide those definitions? And is it even safe to include it in colloquial use? There is a difference between knowing something makes you anxious versus something that worsens your anxiety. There’s a difference between wanting things done a certain, precise way and living with OCD. We think that this language is harmless, but this kind of language is the foundation of improving the increasingly elusive concept of “mental wellness.” Emotional literacy is about recognizing and articulating one’s emotional state using emotion words, not the conditions associated with emotional dysregulation. Why does it feel necessary in our campus culture that we need to use clinical language to describe natural and often vulnerable reactions? Or to justify our very real desires for things like rest, good food or alone time?If we cannot necessarily rely on a psychiatric consensus to advocate for our vulnerable experiences, we can at least strive towards a method of self-communication better rooted in neutrality.Nik Narain is a Trinity junior.

Attention and morality,Jess Jiang,2024-02-07T05:00:00Z,Feb,7,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/020724-jiang-attention-morality-20240207.html,"What happens when we can’t pay attention? As someone whose goals depend — perhaps too much — on my competence, the thought of not being able to pay attention upsets me.But lapses in attention are inevitable. Whatever the cause — lack of sleep, stress, illness and so on — it’s impossible to pay attention to everything all the time. But what happens morally when we can’t pay attention? If you believe that one must know what the consequences of an action are to act morally, then to be moral is to have at least some knowledge of the world. Even if your intentions are angelic, you can still end up doing a decent amount of harm without adequate knowledge. For example, you might neglect marginalized people for the benefit of the majority if you follow the most simplistic form of utilitarianism: Pursuing the greatest good for the greatest number of people — no further nuance. You could, as in a classic critique of the philosopher Immanuel Kant’s categorical imperative, answer truthfully when the polite inquiring murderer asks if your friend’s in the house and end up one friend down. Yes, telling the truth is usually the moral thing to do, but did you really want to trade a friend for an inquiring murderer, even if they’re polite?So if you accept that morality depends on knowledge of the consequences of your actions, then where does attention — which I’ll define as the conscious, present effort to grasp the reality or truth of something outside of one’s conscious self — fit into morality?The philosopher Iris Murdoch, inspired by Simone Weil, places moral attention at the center of morality — moral attention meaning not the attention that one gives to the physical world (which I’ll loosely call intellectual attention) but instead attention to people, which Murdoch describes as a “just and loving gaze directed upon an individual reality.” According to Murdoch, attention helps us see moral reality more clearly by ridding ourselves of our egos. Similarly, journalist David Foster Wallace claims in his commencement speech “This is Water” that we become less solipsistic when we pay attention to the people around us. Both Murdoch and Wallace agree that moral attention helps one escape the gravity of self-centeredness to see the moral world more accurately. In practice, this could look like examining your own biases, giving others the benefit of the doubt or choosing to be kind.Moral attention is different from intellectual attention in that its subject is not the physical body or any other scientific phenomena, but rather people’s inner minds. Moral attention concerns the reality-adjacent world we inhabit inside our heads, the felt part of consciousness that has no scientific equivalent, and the illusions our minds create for us that don’t exist in the real world. Whereas intellectual attention posits the individual as the subject and the rest of the world as the object, moral attention questions the very validity of one’s point of view. Take color, for example. Physically, color is nothing more than different intensities of electromagnetic wavelengths hitting the back of the eye. Experienced color exists only in the mind — sure, light of different wavelengths exists in the physical world, but it’s our brains that interpret these waves as red, green or blue. Who are you to say that your experience of color is objectively real, when another person may not see the world the same way — that is, from your point of view? If there’s one upside to not being able to pay attention or to undergoing any other hardship, it’s being forced into a different perspective. This is the only sense in which the saying “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” is actually true. Now that you’ve experienced hardship, you are now uniquely situated to help others who go through the same thing. In all other respects, this saying could be untrue — maybe you’ve lost people you love, physical or metaphorical parts of yourself, or basic living necessities. The only thing that you’ve gained for certain is a new perspective on the world — a perspective that may be sorely needed. I don’t think we can be morally responsible for paying attention if it’s physically impossible to pay attention. That’s why, I suppose, so many rules, regulations, checklists and instructions exist. We codify what is important so that competence doesn’t depend solely on our fluctuating ability to pay attention.As a society, the best we can do is to establish moral rules that are well-founded and encourage people to pay moral attention. Simply following predetermined moral rules is not moral. If you don’t bother to pay attention to the rules and think for yourself, how do you know they’re moral? The political thinker Hannah Arendt argues in her 1963 essay “Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil” that evil isn’t exceptional. Normal, average people who do not question rules but are complacent in the ordinary way, or who are encouraged more to be successful than morally reflective, are capable of doing awful things. Eichmann, for example, was by all accounts a normal, nice guy with friends and family who just also happened to be the officer in charge of deporting Jewish people to extermination camps during World War II. Arendt hypothesizes that one can commit horrible acts as an ordinary person simply by following the rules. If one doesn’t bother to think, one may not even realize that one’s actions are deeply wrong.If I had to connect this article back to the Duke student — which unfortunately, being an opinion columnist for a college newspaper, I kind of have to — I’d have to echo Wallace. Part of the learning we do in school here is obviously intellectual, and intellectual attention is an important kind of attention. But what about moral attention? College is, as Wallace puts it, a journey of learning what to pay attention to. It’s not enough to just learn how to think, but also to learn where to direct one’s attention. To Murdoch, the direction of our moral attention is the only thing we have some control over.The only moral responsibility we have regarding attention is to choose to pay attention when we can. Attention itself cannot be a moral responsibility. One may literally be unable to pay attention. But when we are able to, it’s our responsibility to pay attention to our lack of knowledge, to our prejudices conscious and unconscious and to all the people we interact with.Jess Jiang is a Trinity senior.

Less is more,Anna Garziera,2024-02-07T05:00:00Z,Feb,7,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/020724-less-is-more-20240207.html,"Springtime is upon us. With that comes warmer weather, delicate flower buds, longer days and a newfound feeling of freshness that comes with all things new. Spring is peeling the protective film off a new iPhone. Spring is folding clothes that are warm, fresh out of the dryer. Spring is taking a cold shower on a hot day.Speaking of laundry and showers, spring comes with the stereotype of a sudden urge to declutter, to deep clean all corners of our houses. As much as I’d like this to apply to the Duke student population, we college students don’t clean our dorm rooms half as much as we claim to. While cleaning our spaces is all very well, there are some areas of our lives that remain neglected year after year. “Spring cleaning” shouldn’t only apply to our physical environment — it doesn’t have to stop at dust bunnies and cobwebs.If we’re honest with ourselves, there are several areas of our lives that could use some cleaning up. With busy schedules, crowded desktops and stagnant New Year’s ambitions, there’s enough for several seasons over.Evidently, college students are incredibly busy. This is especially true here at Duke, with the Centennial Celebration, tenting, pledging and midterms occurring simultaneously.However, there is one solution to a busy life that is so simple and yet underestimated: Just as one might declutter his junk drawer, he should also declutter his routine.Decluttering can be as significant as abandoning a hefty commitment (I recall leaving my job at the Student Mailbox Center after only two weeks) and as simple as foregoing a couple of unimportant, uninteresting weekly newsletter events. FOMO is going around faster than the flu these days, with everything from Rush to UNC games to miss out on. However, by releasing unnecessary obligations, college life will start to feel a lot more manageable.Since writing a research paper for Writing 101, Bookmark Manager has become my new best friend. With assignments, important documents, online resources and endless Instagram posts to keep track of, technological clutter is a monster that is very much real. I see this on the desktops of the students that sit in front of me in class. As much as I’d like to see a picture of their dog or a cool mountain range, there are so many files — all on top of one another — that the desktop background is difficult to decipher. (Although, this might also be a cool strategy to fend off potential hackers — who could ever guess that one’s tax records are named “Document 4” or “kjgnri.pdf” or “IMPORTANT123”?)Jokes aside, technological clutter is just as distracting and unproductive as physical clutter. With a push towards converting everything to online, I wouldn't be surprised if some Duke students had yet to use a printer this year. Then, an organized online platform is key to efficiency. I’m looking at unread inboxes, unnamed files, unused apps. Get rid of it all — if you change your mind, “undo” is one click away.The average human brain takes in around 74GB of data every day. Thus, it is no wonder that our minds always feel so overcrowded. And while a long walk with a friend can be a good outlet for a “trauma dump,” this friend probably has enough things to worry about as it is. Online journal use is on the rise — if your thoughts feel disorganized, there could be some benefit to writing them down.Now, as spring semester freshmen, we might say that our relationships with other students are at least somewhat settled. Therefore, our lives require some introspection: Which relationships do we value the most? It’s important to ask ourselves this so that we may prioritize — after all, our time and energy are limited. There’s no need to cut people out of your life completely, if they’re not causing any harm. However, choose how to split your time wisely. Give priority only to those who deserve it.Especially when trying to maximize academic potential in a top college, our harmful tendencies can really get in the way. I was recently advised not to smoke unless I’d already started. While this was all said to me in a lighthearted context, bad habits are a serious topic. Although they’re hard to let go of, bad habits can too be eradicated.Completely opposite to this, trying to upkeep too many good habits might also be a bad idea. If you’ve been keeping up with my articles, you’ll remember my “guide” to creating achievable New Year’s goals. January has just ended, which means our free trial is over. If your list of goals is overwhelming, it might be worth slimming down.After all of these considerations, the classic conclusion hits us like a truck: less is more. So, get yourself fewer desktop files, fewer bad habits, events to attend, friendships to keep track of. Your next step is clear. Start working some Marie Kondo magic into your life. Start tasting that cathartic freedom. Then, we shall step into spring with a lighter foot, with less clothes on our shoulders and less worries on our minds.Anna Garziera is a Trinity first-year.

The best and worst dining options on West Campus (a ranking),Alex Berkman,2024-02-06T05:00:00Z,Feb,6,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/020624-berkman-ranking-wu-20240206.html,"My friends and family often give me a hard time. I tend to want to rate any and everything — particularly food. It’s to the point where my own mom dreads coming out to dinner with me, and to be honest, I don’t blame her. I would hate to go out with me too.“The linguine vongole — 8.7. Perfectly al dente.”“The lamb kofta — 7.7. Only because I’m feeling generous.”“The carne asada — 4.3. No seasoning and overcooked. A shame.”“Alex, can’t you just shut up and enjoy the food?”Now maybe this makes me a “foodie” — or, more likely, just a complete snob. On my Notes app, you will also find extensive rankings lists of all the movies and TV shows I have seen, the trips I have been on, favorite actors/actresses, NFL players, animals, cereals, pasta dishes and memorable moments in my life. Practically any and everything is on limits — besides people I know of course. Obviously …Fine, I will concede. I am going to work on restricting this type of obnoxious dinner practice to those closest to me. But besides that, the rankings bit is here to stay. For me, asking someone what their favorite “x” is allows us to discuss topics that we are oddly passionate about. It also sparks a friendly debate that — in my case at least — may go on for hours. And I mean, who doesn’t like to go blow for blow with their good friends, as surface level conversations about the best point guards in the NBA transforms into personal digs about each other’s social lives. Isn’t that just the best?So, for example, the food scene at Duke is great. We have all been at least a little bit spoiled by WU — likely one of the best dining halls in the country. However, what’s the fun in saying, “WU is awesome. The food is amazing. Duke’s amazing. Everything is just perfect and great.”?This is my point. Of course, it is important that we express our gratitude and appreciate everything that is offered to us. No one is denying this. However — and maybe this is just me — I would much prefer to read an opinion piece that ranks all of Duke’s dining spots rather than one that simply tells me how thankful I should be for the food at this school. So that is precisely what I will do. Let’s get into it. (Full rankings for the top 20 West Campus dining options will be revealed at the end of the article.)Best Value: Tandoor/The Chef’s Kitchen In terms of value, you will have a tough time beating out Tandoor. For under $12, you can find yourself a more than generous serving of two proteins, a vegetable, white rice and naan. Of course, everyone love chicken tikka masala and chana masala, but if you want to try something new, check out the Chicken 65 (deep fried marinated chicken with curry leaves and green chilies), beef aloo (Indian curry made with ground beef and potatoes), and a vegan take on saag paneer (cooked spinach studded with cubes of tofu). With that said, the biggest surprise on this list may just be “The Chef’s Kitchen – ‘A Taste of the Hawaiian Islands!’” Oh, the Hawaiian place? I didn’t realize it had a name. As part of a new six-week rotation of pop up spots on the top floor of WU, the “Hawaiian Place” is the first to be featured. Now, in this past week alone (and my first time learning of its existence), I have already eaten here four times. The sticky short rib may just be the best item in all of WU, the grilled mahi mahi is an amazing change of pace and all the sides — which include mixed grilled vegetables, mac salad and slaw — are perfect complements to create a savory, sweet and absolutely loaded lunch. It is unfortunate that it will only be around for six weeks, but I look forward to trying some of The Chef’s Kitchen’s new creations. Needs to Step it Up: It’s ThymeNow, on to the not so good. I can confidently say that “The Chef’s Kitchen” has had one of the greater glow ups in recent memory, in its transition from It’s Thyme to the ""Hawaiian Place."" “It’s actually really good, I promise. Just give it a chance.” I have given it a chance. I have given it seven chances. Trust me, I don’t find joy in writing this review because I wanted to love It’s Thyme so badly. In theory, the concept of healthy, ethnic bowls is right up my alley. Each time I go into It’s Thyme, I plan on tasting a new bowl, whether it be the Santorini Sunset, Blue Devil’s Thyme or Charbel's Bowl Beirut, hoping that this is the one to win me over. Yet, I have been left constantly disappointed. It tries so hard to include many different cuisines, from Mediterranean to Caribbean, Lebanese to Thai. However, the result is that no single bowl feels entirely authentic or encapsulating of the cuisine that it is trying to represent. May I say It’s Thyme is truly a “jack of all trades, master of none.” My suggestion to “It’s Thyme” is that it works on revamping its menu to be more centralized in focus (e.g. focus on Greek food … please). What I imagine we would then find is a great improvement in quality.Hidden Gem: Yalla!Located in the parking lot behind Kilgo, this Kosher and Halal food truck is serving up Mediterranean classics, including pita sandwiches, hummus bowls and limonana — a minty lemonade of Lebanese origin. In terms of freshness and quality, Yalla! may just be the best option on West Campus. My go-to is the Uruguayan ribeye platter — served with Israeli salad, cabbage slaw, a pita and house-made hummus. If you are looking to try something new, check out Yalla’s Wednesday special — the arayes, a grilled pita filled with a mixture of minced meat (typically beef or lamb), a variety of spices and tahini dressing. If you haven’t been to Yalla! or have yet to even hear of it, this is your sign to go check it out. Underrated: FarmsteadIs it American? Maybe it's Thanksgiving themed? But they also offer lamb gyro, falafel wraps and burger sliders. Perhaps farm to table is the best way to describe it. What is clear about Farmstead is that it is far from the flashiest option in West Union. What likely works against it is that unlike its counterparts, there is no clear ethnic theme in the food they offer. When you are in the mood for Asian fusion, you go to Ginger and Soy, when you want bar food, you go to Kraft or Gothic. Sushi? Gyotaku. Barbecue? Skillet. Italian? Il Forno. But, do not overlook Farmstead, as I can assure you that their food is without question among the best in WU. Now maybe my family is just comprised of bad cooks, but Farmstead’s oven baked turkey is far better than any Thanksgiving turkey I have ever eaten. Their roasted potatoes, balsamic glazed brussel sprouts and green beans are the perfect sides to any hearty meal. And if you are looking for affordable, try out their $5 option of bourbon garlic chicken served over rice. We apologize Farmstead … we were not familiar with your game. Overrated: Il FornoNow, it is likely that I have been spoiled as a New Yorker who has grown up on excellent Italian food (I’m sorry NYC kids, I meant to say that I am from Westchester), but Il Forno just does not do it for me. Their pasta is often overcooked and has a mushy texture, and their signature red sauce — which is used on both their pasta and pizza — is way too sweet. One more thing, chicken or salmon have no business being served on pasta. I don’t care if you are trying to get your protein intake for the day or even if it actually tastes good. It’s wrong. It’s just plain wrong. But if you are really craving pizza, order a personal pie fresh to order; and make sure to add their hot honey. It’s a tremendous improvement from their individual slices. Best Overall: Ginger and SoyCould it really have been anywhere other than G-Soy? The versatility, the freshness, the explosive flavor combinations — Ginger and Soy takes the crown as the best overall dining spot on West Campus. May I mention, as someone who enjoys offering a hot take, I regret slotting Ginger and Soy here. In a way, it was almost too predictable. I mean, if you are reading this now, you have likely waited all this time to see what is ranked as the best at Duke, only to arrive at the most glaringly obvious choice ... Borrrrring. But most of the time, when something or some place is so widely recognized as the best, it is likely because it quite simply is the best. The taste of their food is almost as delicious as it is aesthetically pleasing to look at. The tuna poké bowl is my personal favorite. But their ramen is equally flavorful, and their unique bowl creations offer a ton of variety, with every ingredient being clearly fresh and well seasoned. Congratulations Ginger and Soy!Special Shout Out: The Nasher CafeNow, before I get to my final top 20 rankings, I must shout out The Nasher Cafe, which was solely omitted from this list because it is not located on West Campus. However, when considering all of Duke’s dining options that take food points, The Nasher most certainly offers the freshest and most flavorful food creations. All of their dishes are farm to table, their weekend brunch is among the best in Durham, and their sandwiches are absolutely delicious. My personal favorite is their fried green tomato sandwich, served on pressed ciabatta with fresh mozzarella, bacon and chipotle aioli. The Nasher is an absolute must try.

Lessons in love and letting go: The college 'situationship',Barbara Cardenas,2024-02-05T05:00:00Z,Feb,5,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/020524-cardenas-lessons-situationship-20240205.html,"Humans have a distinct tendency to learn most effectively through their own experiences. It’s an inherent characteristic — we are stubborn beings, often resistant to advice and guidance no matter how wise or well-intentioned it might be. This trait seems almost universal, and it’s one I’ve observed not only in those around me but also within myself. We often need to feel the heat of the fire firsthand before we truly understand why we were warned against it.This was vividly illustrated to me last semester in the life of one of my closest friends. She began a relationship with someone who, on the surface, seemed to be an ideal match for her. He was charming — an athlete and seemingly very much interested in her. Observing this budding connection, I felt a surge of happiness for her. After all, seeing a friend find someone who sparks joy in their life is a cause for celebration.Despite having been in a stable relationship myself for some time, past experiences with the complexities of romance were still fresh in my memory. These experiences gave me a certain perspective on relationships, a lens through which I could offer my friend advice and support. Yet, as I’ve come to learn, advice can only go so far. Each person must navigate the intricacies of their relationships in their own way, making their own discoveries and — inevitably — their own mistakes.In her situation, the excitement of a new romance quickly gave way to the realities of an undefined and complicated relationship. What started as something seemingly simple and enjoyable soon turned into a lesson in emotional boundaries and self-awareness.As the semester trudged on, my friend’s relationship, or more accurately, her “situationship,” began to overshadow other aspects of her college life. While her academic performance remained steadfast, her emotional world was in a state of on-and-off turbulence. Her once diverse conversations now had a singular focus: him and their undefined relationship. This proximity meant frequent, often unintended encounters, making it nearly impossible for her to gain the distance she occasionally sought.In this college setting, where personal spaces often overlap, their ambiguous relationship became an undercurrent to our daily lives. Despite its unofficial status, the emotional investment was palpable. It was as if their casual, non-committal interactions somehow carried the weight of a more profound, intricate relationship. Each casual glance, each accidental meeting was analyzed and dissected, not just by her but by our entire friend circle, sometimes adding more confusion to her already mixed feelings.I couldn’t help but see parallels between her situation and my own past experiences. Having navigated my share of complicated relationships in college, I understood all too well the allure and the pain of such entanglements. Now, in a serious relationship myself, it was easier to spot the red flags, pitfalls and emotional turmoil she was going through. But even when he treated her poorly, and one could almost say humiliated her, she just couldn’t let him go. As hard as that was to watch, I remembered the reluctance to leave someone, even when you knew they weren’t good for you. It was a tough spot, one where the heart and mind often find themselves at odds. My own journey through these tumultuous waters had taught me empathy and patience, both of which I tried to offer her.As time passed, the “situationship” started to unravel. There was no dramatic breakup because there was never an official relationship. Instead, there was a gradual, albeit painful, drift. They began seeing less of each other, and their encounters became more sporadic, more civil, less charged. This slow fade brought a different kind of closure, one that was less about endings and more about accepting the ephemeral nature of some connections.This college experience, set against the backdrop of academic learning and personal exploration, highlighted a crucial aspect of growing up. It taught us that not all relationships are meant to have clear definitions or predictable paths. Some connections are there to teach us about the complexities of human emotions, the value of understanding our own needs and the importance of setting boundaries.Ultimately, the biggest takeaway was that some of life’s most crucial lessons are learned not through advice or cautionary tales, but through our own experiences. They may not always be pleasant, but they are invariably valuable. They teach us resilience, self-awareness and the often underrated skill of letting go. College, in this sense, becomes more than an academic journey; it’s a pivotal stage for personal and emotional development, where each experience, each “situationship,” each challenge, shapes us into more mature, understanding individuals ready for the complex world beyond campus walls.Barbara Cardenas is a Trinity junior.

Line monitors implement strict 'No Meanies Allowed' rule in K-Ville ,Monday Monday,2024-02-05T05:00:00Z,Feb,5,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/020524-monday-monday-line-monitors-20240205.html,"The annual hoard of Duke students has erected dozens of tents in front of Wilson on their journey from the comfort of their dorm rooms to the brutal, not quite freezing (grace below 32 degrees) conditions of the great North Carolina wilderness of Krzyzewskiville. The tradition of rejecting heat and sleep for a tightly-squeezed, uncomfortable viewing experience of the Duke-UNC basketball game dates back over 30 years. This year, however, major changes from line monitors means tenting might look a little different. “We are really trying to redefine the K-Ville experience to emphasize the three pillars that make K-Ville great: positivity, excellence and energy,” the line monitors released in a statement. At a recent town hall, line monitors unveiled new rules for conduct in Cameron Indoor Stadium. In response to concerns that Cameron Crazies were simply “too uproarious” and “unsportsmanlike,” chants have been banned in Cameron. To prevent overstimulation of attendees, students are asked to limit themselves to a stern finger wagging and one “aw shucks!” per half.“The ‘Hi, you suck!’ line is a step too far. Even UNC players deserve our respect,” said senior Fuht Balsckul, the newly-appointed Head Line Monitor For Inclusion and Positive Sportsmanship who has suggested that in place of jeers, students can decisively shake their heads at silly plays. Concerned that the term “Cameron Crazies” might make light of mental illness, Balsckul also declared that tenters are to be called “Cameron Commoners.”The town hall arrives as a part of a greater initiative to make K-Ville be more “inclusive, equitable, individual, communal, warm and sanitized” according to the mission statement adopted by DSG, in collaboration with the line monitors, earlier this year. With help from Facilities and Management, K-Ville is slated for a list of renovations to make “the Ville” more homey and pleasant. To ensure that tenting is easy and no poor student has to suffer in the cold for any game ever again, Duke plans to invest in fairy lights to string around tents, fire pits and heated sidewalks in the walkways. To make better use of the space in K-Ville that is lacking tents this year, the left side of the lawn will be converted into a golf green. Criticized by some for leading the “Kentrification” of K-Ville, line monitors have drawn heat from some long-time residents of K-Ville.“It’s just not what it used to be. The culture has changed,” said junior Matthew McMann, a self-proclaimed Cameron Crazy. “Everyone in K-Ville used to be miserable and drunk all the time. Now people are well-rested and selling kombucha for $5 a can. This just isn’t the K-Ville I remember.” The shifts come at a time when more and more people are concerned that Cameron has lost the “crazy” spirit — from throwing pizza boxes to lingerie on the court to heckle opposing players — that gave the Cameron Crazies their name. Line monitors in particular have been called out for slacking on checks and themselves not meeting requirements tenters are subjected to, to which Head Line Monitor Rick Shies responded, “Aww boo hoo, the tenters are mad again!”Tent checks, the most dreaded part of tenting, have seen a major change. In place of a blaring siren, line monitors will now tip-toe from tent to tent, whispering softly in the ears of sleepers and asking them to rise. Line monitor cuddle sessions will also be held as regularly-scheduled spirit attendance events. “Some people say K-Ville’s gone soft. But I say the line monitors are harder than ever!” Balsckul said.Rebutting concerns that they are in bed with “Big Line Monitor,” Monday Monday is pitching a different kind of “tent” in K-Ville this week."
Stop being late,Heidi Smith,2024-02-05T05:00:00Z,Feb,5,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/020424-smith-stop-being-late-20240205.html,"The year is 2020. You’re sitting in your bedroom in a presentable top and pajama pants, gathering the mental fortitude to click on a Zoom link to join class, a club meeting or maybe a random webinar. You wait until the clock hits the exact start time and click to connect. Upon entering the meeting, the host announces, “Let’s just wait a couple more minutes for everyone else to log on.” Great, what a waste of time!Covid and Zoom taught us a lot of things, including the idea that being early isn’t always a good thing. In fact, it disincentivized it. If you showed up before the Zoom meeting started, you probably had to wait until the host started the meeting, sending them an email notification of your presence in their Zoom meeting or were forced to make small talk with the other people who — for some strange reason — also showed up before it was fashionably late to do so.Now, back to the present. As I arrive, predictably, five minutes late to yet another social engagement or walk into class at the exact minute it’s scheduled to start, I am reminded that I was not always like this. I was raised to think that being early is on time and being on time is late — and if you’re late, well, you might as well just not show up. But frankly, it’s not seen as a big deal to be late anymore, so no one does anything about it.But I’d argue it is a big deal. Sure, unexpected situations happen every once in a while — a bus breaks down, a meeting holds you over, and so on — but the frequency at which we Duke students are late to things is indicative of broader problems than just the shortened times between classes or our perennial business. It signifies a lack of respect for other peoples’ schedules and poor time management skills. Perhaps it’s also a sort of retribution: You waste my time, and I’ll waste yours.It’s pretty obvious why everyone always being late isn’t a great thing — and, indeed, it tends to contribute to additional tardiness when everything gets started five minutes after its scheduled time. What worries me more is that there is no incentive to be early, nor does being late bring any consequences. It’s rare that something starts on time these days, and even if someone arrives a few minutes after the thing starts, seldom are they admonished — and if they are, it often is seen as uptight.When timeliness is taken seriously, it often feels like a generational clash. Now, the boomers and Gen X-ers may be misguided about a lot of things, but I think they’re on the right track with this one. Perhaps we Gen Zs don’t take things like being on time as seriously as our parents did because we lead generally easier lives than them and didn’t have to experience as much punishment growing up. Maybe offloading our calendars to our phones removes a sense of personal culpability. Perhaps, we do not care enough to be bothered by something silly like being on time.You may disagree that we should harp on the little things so much. However, if someone cares little about the little things, I’d hazard a guess that they probably won’t take the big ones 100% seriously, either. A person’s relationship to and respect for their broader community is evident in everything they do. The way we’re acting shows we don’t care about how we treat each other — unless we want something from someone else.Because it’s not just about being late — and at least if you’re late for class, you’re actually going to it — this is one of many ways we, as Duke students, have collectively decided to put ourselves over others. We make plans with friends just to cancel when a better offer arrives. We “forget” to show up to something and blame it on our calendars. We take ages to text people back, even though we see the message instantly. We keep friends around for convenience who might prove useful later on.Living in this environment has caused us to adopt its norms. Although there are exceptions, all of the tiny daily choices and actions we make are influenced by the observations we make. Through trial and error, we see what gets us ahead and what sets us behind. Many disrespectful behaviors are only acceptable due to their near-universal adoption in our community.The concept of altruism — the act of doing good by others without the expectation of reward — is alien on our campus. Indeed, when someone does something nice for me these days, I’ve started to question their motives. Maybe I’m just paranoid from one too many “Hey, how are you?” texts out of the blue that are followed up with a request for a favor.Often, making a small personal sacrifice can greatly benefit the people around us. Pulling the door shut instead of letting it slam when you know your roommates are sleeping. Avoiding taking a four-person table during WU rush hour for yourself. Letting people who were at the bus stop before you enter first. We have no mutual impetus for calling out bad behavior because we don’t want to remove the possibility of us acting similarly later on — if we’re all rude, somehow that makes it okay.I won’t blame this all on COVID-19, but I do think the pandemic enabled it. We would be remiss to dismiss the developmental detriment of essentially having no expectations and limited accountability to authority figures for two years during our development. When your goal goes from extreme academic performance to just successfully existing and back again, it’s no wonder we find it difficult to return to what real adults love to call “our new normal.”The pandemic certainly illuminated the silliness of certain aspects of our society, but that doesn’t mean everything needs to change. The pandemic taught us the importance of interpersonal connection; now that meeting in person is again the norm, we should show each other the shred of humanity that it takes to plan ahead enough to arrive on time — or, better yet, a minute or five early. It’s not too late to set an easy goal for the year; I plan to do my best to respect the time of those around me and hope that they can do the same for me.Heidi Smith is a Trinity senior.

"Give It’s Thyme a chance, but always remember Panda Express",Jessica Luan,2024-02-02T05:00:00Z,Feb,2,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/020224-luan-remember-panda-express-20240202.html,"I really like It’s Thyme, and I think students should eat there more. But I am not glad they replaced Panda Express. In fact, I am still sad that Panda is gone. At first, I refused to patronize It’s Thyme on principle. Mostly, I blamed them for displacing my beloved Panda. I also resented how they exemplified the bowl-ification of Duke Dining. I disliked the lemon chicken and black beans served during their testing phase at Chef’s Kitchen, which epitomized the seasoning practices of bodybuilder cuisine (squeeze of lemon, hold the salt). I went recently, ready to be the ultimate hater. Like a Clemson football fan, I sulked and lurked about the premises. But then I took my first bite, and I was gobsmacked. The food was really good!My bowl was refreshing, flavorful and hearty. The lemon chicken had leveled up. It was shredded rather than chunked, and it was significantly juicier. The black beans were well-seasoned and perfectly cooked. Julienned carrots, homemade pickled jalapenos and piquant toum provided freshness, zing and spice. Additionally, the generous helping of protein, five hearty scoops of vegetable toppings and an adequately-sized container provided significant heft. I even had leftovers! It’s Thyme achieved the optimal balance between the often-generous, sometimes-oily Sazon and the never-generous, often-refreshing Ginger + Soy. I went back for the next three meals in a row. The food tasted better each time. Even during lunch rush, the staff were friendly, efficient and calm. Evidently, the restaurant’s team was actively improving their offerings to provide the best customer experience possible.I’m thrilled to have a new restaurant in my rotation, but I feel bittersweet about Panda’s closure. It’s a shame that Panda is gone, but it’s also a shame that It’s Thyme’s arrival — what should have been an exciting occasion — coincided with the elimination of Panda Express.In fact, Duke Dining explicitly stated in their press release of It’s Thyme’s opening that “the West Campus venue will replace Panda Express.” Without advance notice, students felt shocked and betrayed. Unfortunately, the sudden closure of campus favorites is eerily familiar. Nearly a decade ago, Grace’s Cafe, another beloved restaurant, was announced to close with little advance notice. Nearly a thousand undergraduates, alumni, professors, hospital workers and graduate students signed a Change.org petition in a futile effort to overturn the decision. Like Panda, Grace’s Cafe also served homestyle favorites, but better. In addition to steamed rice, stir-fried vegetables and meats full of wok hei (a flavor now extinct on campus), Grace’s served beef noodle soups, Lunar New Year specials and even comfort foods like tomato eggs and jjamppong. Ultimately, Gyotaku and Ginger + Soy replaced the family-run restaurant. Similar to today, a hip, trendy eatery replaced a stalwart student favorite. Some may argue that Panda Express is mostly relevant to students of Chinese heritage. I argue that Panda Express is culturally relevant to all students regardless of their ethnic background.After all, there are over 35,000 Chinese restaurants in America, more than those of McDonalds, Burger Kings, Kentucky Fried Chickens and Wendy’s combined. This mind-boggling supply of Chinese restaurants indicates that there is no small appetite for Chinese cuisine. I didn’t grow up eating Chinese takeout, but I’ve learned through sitcoms —known for their slice-of-life portrayals of America— that Chinese takeout is a national institution. Are Duke students’ tastes really so different from the country at large?In fact, Panda’s absence tightens the Duke bubble. We have crepes, sushi and bowls in every color and shape imaginable, but we do not have kung pao chicken. Without Panda, Duke campus life reflects American life a little bit less, and imitates the life of the high-powered Sweetgreen machine a little bit more. I think some students were partially upset that with Panda gone, there is one less option for Asian-ish food. But students were also upset that, from an outside perspective, the decision not to renew Panda’s contract felt opaque and premeditated. Why couldn’t Panda’s contract get renewed? Was Panda Express really so much more unhealthy than other deep-fried delights on campus, like vegan tenders, buffalo wings or mac-and-cheese bites? Was national branding really so detrimental to Duke Dining’s community-driven mission?I don’t mean to wax poetic about Panda Express or fangirl over It’s Thyme more than necessary. Mostly, I feel sad that these two restaurants’ fates became intertwined in a zero sum competition. In either case, Panda’s loss seemed like It’s Thyme's gain, and it’s unfortunate that It’s Thyme was caught in a crossfire. Regardless of their backstory, It’s Thyme is here to stay, and students would be doing their taste buds a disservice by not giving the restaurant a fair chance.In the future, I hope Duke Dining will handle restaurant changes differently. Providing hard revenue and profit numbers, as well as soliciting student input through campus-wide forms rather than select focus groups, would promote a culture of transparency. Bringing back wok hei wouldn’t hurt either. Jessica Luan is a Trinity senior. Her column typically runs on alternate Fridays. "
To: me. Love: me,Advikaa Anand,2024-02-01T05:00:00Z,Feb,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/020124-anand-to-me-love-me-20240201.html,"My biggest fear is being alone. When I was younger, loneliness did not appear to be such a foe. Moments spent alone enabled me to seek refuge in my imagination. There, I could conjure perfect friends who said perfect things at the perfect time. There, I could silence intrusive thoughts dwelling on whether my teacher had begun to dislike me because I was a little too chatty. There, among vast flower fields and vibrant pink skies, I was free — free from judgment, free from the anxiety of what others thought of me, free from the disease to please. But now loneliness no longer feels replete with endless abandon. Instead, it seems to project an unflattering reflection of me. It appears as a testament to my inadequacies, as proof of unrealized fears that there is something wrong with me. As I delve deeper and deeper into adulthood, it seems to me that our self-identities and perceptions are increasingly contingent on our relationships with others. Are we succeeding in our roles as friends, students, professionals, children and partners? Are we fulfilling our obligations to all the people in our lives?Thus, when we are alone, living our lives just as ourselves, we are forced to observe our identities as independent human beings. Our minds veer to pondering abstract qualities — traits that cannot be so easily quantified by external observations: Are we successful? Are we worthy? Are we enough?Socializing enables us to escape these painful thoughts; loneliness forces us to confront them. And so, we spend much of our lives running away from loneliness, forgetting that we can seek company with ourselves.But is perpetual socialization healthy?A psychological study by the German Socio-Economic Panel showed that, “The highest level of social contact frequency was not associated with substantially better health and longer life than the moderate frequency.” In fact, going beyond daily interaction frequency was sometimes related to “higher mortality risks and lower survival time.”Moreover, spending time with others all the time can hinder us from availing the benefits of being alone. Being alone offers you an opportunity to know yourself better — to understand the things that make you happy, to reflect on your strengths and shortcomings and to build confidence in yourself to navigate different complex situations.Additionally, being alone helps us distill our own inner thoughts from external voices. In the modern age of social media, we are constantly inundated with notifications from others. We’ve become so addicted to the dopamine rushing through our veins when we have an unread message or a pending app alert that we no longer seek joy in hearing our own voices or see the value in having reflective, productive conversations with ourselves. There is no doubt that there is nothing in life like being loved by another. I don’t think I’ve known another feeling like the one that pulses in my heart when my mother washes my hair, her touch more gentle on my skin than my own, or when my father’s steady voice echoes in my ear when I’m in a crisis, a steady reminder that everything will be okay, or when my sister “mistakenly” rolls over in the morning to wrap me in a hug (she loves me!). Through spending time with others, we learn who we want to be, how to treat those around us and gain a keener understanding of the world around us. Relationships with others open our eyes up to the world in ways we’ve never seen before, igniting an appreciation for things we never thought we could love. I never thought I’d crave going to the gym, but friendship taught me how. I never thought that being outside in the rain would make me happy, but friendship taught me how. I never thought my playlist would swing between Drake’s “Rich Baby Daddy Flex” and the soft Bollywood music I listened to growing up, but friendship taught me how. Relationships with others are beautiful.But so is a relationship with yourself. Because it is when we are by ourselves, listening to the quiet hum of our own mind, that we learn who we are — what we value, what we prize, what we can never give up. And we must know who we are now if we ever wish to discover who we will become — we are the foundations of our tomorrow, and that foundation must be unshakeable.There was a moment that I experienced this past weekend that I know I will treasure for the rest of my life — I went on a walk alone in the Duke Gardens at night while it was raining. Not a single soul lingered on the cobblestone pathways. Suddenly, I felt an airy freedom. I closed the umbrella and let the rain cling to my hair. I was dancing, spinning, running, liberated by the thought that no one was watching. In that moment, my heart was filled with peace, knowing that I alone was enough for myself. That epiphany is crucial to your self-development. You are the only person who is going to be with you for every second of the rest of your lifeToday, I challenge you to do something by yourself that you’d normally do with others: take a walk to the Duke pond alone. Dance alone. Eat dinner alone. It may feel odd at first, but I think you’ll feel things you’ve never felt before, and maybe see the world through a lens you’ve never seen before. And I think you’ll discover a friend you’ve had all along:You.Advikaa Anand is a Trinity sophomore. Her column typically runs on alternating Thursdays."
What’s under the rock,Carol Apollonio,2024-01-31T15:10:00Z,Jan,31,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/013124-apollonio-under-rock-20240131.html,"I was at a high-stakes meeting at a top research institution the other day. Mousy, elderly female humanities Professors of the Practice are not usually included in high-level gatherings, so I folded my hands in my lap and switched into listening mode. At the meeting, a terrifying, extremely eminent social-sciences professional pointed out with some fervor that a university Slavic program in the 21st century has no business “throwing Tolstoy at students.” What frivolity to read made-up stories at a time like this! It’s a tough world out there and time is money (время – деньги). Give students a toolkit of basic words and concepts; train them in how to gather facts and summarize arguments in crisp, convincing memos.Polish the student up, slap on a robe and mortarboard and send that product on over to Washington to save the world. Before I clawed my way up into the lowest tiers of the Ivory Tower, I worked as a diplomatic interpreter and translator for the US Department of State. Mostly I was based in Geneva at nuclear weapons talks — the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and the now-defunct Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, things like that — but I also spent a fair amount of time at various gritty sites, including rickety nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe (Kozlodui, Ignalina). The purpose of these meetings was to keep the world from blowing up, but the language was mundane. Once you’ve learned the terms for the delivery vehicles — intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched cruise missiles, heavy bombers and other nouns — it’s just a simple matter of counting these things, moving them around, keeping track of them and figuring out how to destroy them without hurting anybody. Garden-variety verbs, numbers, indicative sentences. Despite what was at stake, weirdly, the language was easy. Not like what Dostoevsky throws at you. I was not “trained” in this skill of shifting words between languages; I was educated. I spent years in graduate school (and decades after) reading dead Russian writers’ novels and criticism about them, and countless hours discussing these books with other people, living as well as dead. The books were not “thrown at” me; rather, I threw myself into them, such that at times it was hard to find my way out. Still is.Obviously.Anyway, one evening I interpreted at a one-on-one dinner at a very fine restaurant in Geneva’s old town. Candlelight, three different kinds of wine, five courses, deferential waiters with starched white napkins draped over their forearms, the whole show culminating in a stupefying Teutonic chocolate torte. “One-on-one” means two ambassadors, but of course it’s actually “two-on-two,” if you count the invisible language personnel. The pattern was for each of us to interpret into the other language: I listened to my guy in English and spoke in Russian, and the other interpreter went in reverse. The Russian diplomat was one of the most erudite, broad-minded and engaging men I have ever met: he shared provocative thoughts and questions about the business at hand (those pesky weapons), military history, nuclear engineering and suchlike matters as you might expect, but also about the differences between our two countries—our histories, value systems, educational institutions, pet care routines, peanut-butter sandwiches, fishing tackle, current TV shows. The interpreter was a genius, too, and subsequently he became famous as a political analyst. In the moment I was profoundly grateful he handled the “peanut-butter sandwiches.” As it happened, the diplomat was fluent in English too — but cagy enough to turn that part over to his interpreter. By contrast, my guy — though a trained expert in his field — had not wasted any time studying history or philosophy or reading literature or, clearly, anything else. He was razor-focused on getting the deal. So mostly what he said was, in the pauses, “Oh, that’s interesting,” or, in exciting moments, “That’s very interesting!” Which, frankly, is a breeze to translate. This was one of the rare occasions when as an interpreter I was able to actually eat the food — normally my guy talks so much I have to be interpreting the whole time, which means dinner will be Cheez-Its from the hotel mini-bar.In short, a delicious evening, a master course in conversation and in translation and the easiest job I ever did. But I did — and still do — harbor a twinge of embarrassment. Who “won” this diplomatic exercise?My Duke Follow-the-Rublers are familiar with a book by economist Morton Schapiro and literature scholar Gary Saul Morson called “Cents and Sensibility,” which is about the challenges facing scholars conducting interdisciplinary work. The most toxic of these challenges is what they call “disciplinary imperialism,” that is, the presumption by some professors that their field explains the entire world and that therefore there is no need for any other kind of inquiry. The worst offenders, as objective data appears to show, are social scientists — notably, economists (disciplinary imperialism; I know you’re in a hurry, so just scoot ahead to minute 7:00).I had to give a trigger warning in class the other day. One of the characters in the book we’re reading goes very deep into that part of the human brain and conscience that we rarely allow ourselves to access. There are some terrifying thoughts lurking down there, kind of like when you are out by the creek and flip over a rock and see all the creepy-crawlies underneath. Homicidal urges, illicit desires, feelings of guilt, revenge or dread, tabooed thoughts about Apocalypse. And of course, the horror you feel when confronted with the rawness of the universe. Mrak, the darkness of the soul. The clean, shiny surface (data, logic, empiricism, research, observations) makes such sense. The solutions seem so easy. Just conduct a few polls, lobby the right politicians, pass a law and presto: No more injustice! Then suddenly some psychopath gets elected Chief Executive.I have never pulled anyone out of a burning building or a roiling river; I have never knocked a gun out of some maniac’s hand or wrested the nuclear briefcase from the President’s twitching fingers. Believe me, when that moment comes, I hope someone steps up. I have not solved the problems of climate change or nuclear Armageddon (though my students and I, along with the writers we read, sure give them a lot of thought). I get that some people go to toxic waste dumps and wind farms and measure things, and that this is important, if the world is to survive. I even vote! But on the battlefield of education, I refuse to concede the value of what we do in literature study.Which is to force, yes, force, students to read mind-blowing books, to slip inside the brains of the people who live in there and to experience their world; then to come back out and discuss their impressions with others, participating in a conversation that human beings have been having for centuries about things that matter. And to be honest, I’d rather send one random student who’s been through this process to a negotiating table than someone who learned a set of facts, mastered a few practical skills, wrote some memos and jotted down everything the professor said.Professor Carol Apollonio has been teaching Russian literature at Duke for 40 years, and this is her final semester.

The strange nostalgia of 20,Anna Sorensen,2024-01-30T05:42:00Z,Jan,30,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/013024-sorensen-strange-nostalgia-of-twenty-20240130.html,"A few days from now, I will turn 20. It’s hard to believe. I know it’s become normalized to let the tears flow on birthdays, but I’ve never really been one to cry on this special occasion. After all, it’s a day I get to make all about myself! This year though, I do feel a certain melancholy or dread about turning 20. We all “officially” become adults when we turn 18, but for some reason, 20 feels more significant.There are so many ideas of what our twenties should look like. We enter the “real world,” get our life together, and hopefully settle down. As a sophomore in college, I don’t feel like I am nearly there at all. I still think of myself as a kid in a lot of ways. I’m most comfortable at home and in my bed with my stuffed animals. I make poor decisions from time to time. I still ask my mom to call the doctor to make my appointments (this should never have to end, by the way). The list goes on. For the most part, I wouldn’t say I function like a full adult in my day to day life. I’ve also become more aware of a subtle sadness about birthdays in college. Don’t get me wrong, I had a great birthday last year, but it was certainly different from any year before. This year again, I won’t be surrounded by my family, and I won’t be able to fully reproduce the birthday traditions I had growing up: the banana chocolate cake, the cards my cats would give me (read: the cards my father wrote and signed as my cats) or the cupcakes I’d bring to my homeroom class. There’s something quite different about coming home to wrapped presents on the kitchen table versus heading into the basement of Bryan Center to pick up some packages. Birthdays in college — however fun and crazy they can be — feel more independent and more difficult to share with everyone you love. As is probably clear by now, I’ve been feeling quite reflective as the big day approaches. I find myself resisting the idea of being twenty pretty often. The truth is, I love being a teenager and I love feeling like I’m still a kid. It’s more complicated than not wanting to deal with adult responsibility or problems; there are some things I am just not willing to give up or grow out of. So, dear reader, here is a list of a few values I will carry into my 20s:1. Awe and appreciation for the world around me As a kid, I reveled in nature almost every day. I found everything beautiful, and I got excited about the smallest of occurrences. I want to hold onto the excitement I feel when it snows and nourish my hyper desire to run around on gorgeous spring days or jump into piles of fall leaves. I just finished reading Ralph Waldo Emerson’s essay on Nature, and I loved his argument that we should all seek to return to a childlike state of mystic oneness with nature. I think a lot of this boils down to the idea of wonder. As I grow up, I don’t ever want to lose my wonder at the miraculous gift of life on earth. I am grateful to be at a place like Duke where I can practice this in so many ways. In fact, I think I may kick off my birthday with a morning walk on the Al Buehler Trail. 2. Honest expression of my emotions Children are some of the most genuine, transparent characters I’ve ever encountered. Someone upsets them? A kid will tell them to their face. Something excites them? A kid will loudly rejoice. Something makes them sad? A kid will cry without hesitation. Sure, there’s a certain amount of emotional regulation that is probably healthy and necessary. I do believe, however, that the world would likely be a better place with richer relationships if we were as transparent as kids are about their feelings. Just because I’ll soon be in my twenties doesn’t mean I should relinquish the natural expressions of my emotions — no matter how irrational they may be.3. Dramatizing my life I felt like such a main character as a child. Some of it probably bordered on arrogance from time to time, but I think the consciousness of myself as a unique individual is something I should pay more attention to as I enter this next stage. It’s the feeling I’d get every time I sang a solo in choir and theater, won a soccer game or had a middle school best friend confide in me. I felt really special on a day to day basis — which can be hard to replicate in college and as you get older. The transition from high school to college where suddenly your talents and skills may not stand out as much has been difficult for a lot of us. I hope that I can begin my 20s with a hefty dose of self-love and appreciation and feel a sense of importance with each day. 4. A continuing process of self-discovery and change When we think about periods of change and growth in our lives, we tend to put a lot of emphasis on puberty and the teenage years. It’s true that from ages 12 to 19 we undergo huge transitions in our lives that force us to adapt and develop — but I don’t feel as though things will settle anytime soon. I resist the idea that we should “have it all together” in our twenties and that our days of mistakes and lessons learned are largely behind us. Sure, there are some mistakes I should probably leave in my teenage years, but I am so proud of the person I became because of them. My sophomore year of high school, for example, was one of the most difficult and unstable periods of my life, but I wouldn’t be nearly as comfortable with myself and confident in my identity today without it. I am excited to see what lessons my 20s hold in store for me, and I secretly hope that they’re a bit of a rollercoaster. At the end of the day, I try to remind myself that birthdays simply mark our linear journey through time. Ideas of “benchmarks” or standardized stages of life are largely made up and don’t always look the same for every person. I’ll grow no more on my birthday than I will the day after, and there’s some comfort in that. For now, I’ll just look forward to waking up on my birthday surrounded by my stuffed animals and celebrating another year in the books. Anna Sorensen is a Trinity sophomore.

The case of overstimulation,Angikar Ghosal,2024-01-29T05:00:00Z,Jan,29,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/012924-ghosal-case-of-overstimulation-20240129.html,"I asked my friend A****** to help me write an article with a mask of intellectualism that no longer relies on maximalist vocabulary. Here is what he recommended.""Certain European art film directors long abandoned any notion of a linear plot — to be critically acclaimed, try to overstimulate the audience. Cram in as many allusions as you can, you know, this montage is of course a reference to Godard, that pan-out is of course a homage to Parajanov, etc. One must also include a recurring theme, say of a necklace, that will forever divide film critics, even if Deleuze came back and wrote a third book on cinema to try resolve the dispute.Why should the textual medium be bereft of the latest developments?For instance, suppose there is an upcoming basketball game against the University of Connecticut which Duke fans are worried about because of the opponent's scarily good power forward. One must write two articles in advance and publish only one of them. Overstimulate the reader in each of them!If Duke wins, publish the article which mentions how the game reminded you of that section in Book 16 of Polybius' Histories, where King Philip V's general Nicanor was considered a threat to the Roman-Aetolian alliance, but the heroics of Titus Quintius meant that the Battle of Cynoscephalae was ultimately won (see Book 18)!If Duke loses, publish the article which regurgitates the done-to-death existentialist observation of the impermanence of glory. Surely Duke students have read Thucydides' account of the Peloponnesian War? In that context, refer to the Battle of Leuctra, on how the glory of the Spartans declined after Cleombrotus lost (see Xenophon's Hellenica, Book 6).""See? Extra cheese makes the pizza more delicious — keep garnishing the text!It was at this stage I argued with my friend. He said that classical references were at least seen as high-nosed and elite and were liked by some fashionable men and women. But to have any sort of social clout, one must sincerely banish from public discourse any vestiges of mathematics at the college level and beyond.You see dear reader, like most analysts, I tend to like pathological geometric examples to make my point. Think of the disappointment I felt when I showed my friend my first draft of the op-ed which included an elaborate analogy using the Tychonoff Corkscrew and the Knaster-Kuratowski fan and he got furious.""Are you kidding me? Don't you know that the only thing you are allowed to say publicly is, 'You see, a coffee cup is the same as a donut, and that is pretty cool!'? What are you going to do next — mention the Adams spectral sequence in a non-academic context? You have IQ, but where is your EQ? Let me guess, you want number theorists to start talking about topics beyond Galois theory publicly and not the same old ‘prime numbers are the building blocks of numbers’?""Oh well, he knows better.He also advised me to include classical references that are not part of the Greco-Roman canon to prevent accusations of political posturing using the Roman Empire. Fair enough. He also cautioned me to not exclusively rely on examples from the Ramayana or the Mahabharata either, to ensure that my reputation as a scholar isn’t boxed into my ethnicity as the “Indian scholar who knows a lot about India."" Why do you think I was encouraged to learn Avestan?I went to the library and pored over Rushdie’s ""Grimus."" I was truly inspired by the story of protagonist Flapping Eagle exploring different identities in this book, a wonderfully postmodern critique of modernist bildungsromans! Equipped with my knowledge of Sasanian history, I proceeded to compare progressive student movements to the Iranian prophet Mazdak and tied the tendencies of Duke fans to perennially feel the current-year freshman basketball player as the ""next Zion Williamson"" or the ""next Grayson Allen,"" as similar to how Khosrow Anushirvan was proclaimed as the next Cyrus the Great.But then I read how Rushdie's debut novel, ""copiously encrusted with mythic and literary allusion, nosedived into oblivion amid almost universal critical derision."" Sadly, I abandoned that literary attempt as a result, especially after Ferdowsi appeared in my dreams and blessed me with the knowledge that intellectual posturing is almost always an offense and is only legal and celebrated for existing intellectuals who are already famous.At this point, I asked my friend, a PhD student in Literature, for advice. He told me, “Remember, Žižek might have written 'Opera’s Second Death' more than two decades before, but who apart from academics read his earlier work? There are probably hundreds of thinkers as well-read and as introspective as him, but they choose to stay within the confines of academia. The reason Žižek is famous in the public sphere is precisely because he chose to blend high and low culture idiosyncratically. Have you seen the video where he says, 'I already am eating from the trash can.'?”So here is the description of a rough draft of the final article I wrote. That article is on the declining attention span of students due to the persistent popularity of TikTok videos, Instagram reels and YouTube shorts. Any Gen-Z student knows that there is a lot of internet lore about online subcommunities that can be only reconstructed through a close reading of social media comment sections.To make an article relatable, one must write as if one is a historian of internet culture, writing in the 2050s. Cram every reference you can - BeamNG car crash simulations, Skibidi toilet videos, montages of fiendish levels of ""Breakout""-like video games, Subway Surfer playthroughs and unrelated videos that have ""Memory Reboot"" by VØJ & Narvent or ""Space Song"" by Beach House or a sped-up ""The Box"" by Roddy Ricch or ""Strangers"" by Kenya Grace or ""greedy"" by Tate McRae playing in the background. You get the idea.One must resist the urge to insert references to Heidegger (no one has read ‘Being and Time’). However, Mark Fisher is okay to include, as his ideas have sufficiently permeated the Reddit-Twitter internet discourse. Then one adds a link to an academic study on how human attention is the most valuable commodity in the techno-capitalist world. To finish up the essay, write about how video creators attempt to catch attention through overstimulation and playing two to three concurrent videos, for instance, one in the background, and one each in the upper and lower half of the screen. Long live overstimulation.As attention spans have declined, that article has not been provided in The Chronicle. Interested readers are advised to use the last two paragraphs and ask ChatGPT to reproduce a hypothetical article based on them if you want. As Barthes would say, the author is dead, and hence, the article has been left as an exercise for the reader.Angikar Ghosal is a Trinity senior. His column typically runs on alternating Mondays."
Personality tests and the absurdity of self-awareness,Nik Narain,2024-01-29T05:00:00Z,Jan,29,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/012924-narain-personality-tests-self-awareness-20240129.html,"In case you were wondering, I’m an open, over-neurotic INFJ MBTI subtype who’s an Enneagram Achiever and visual learner. My Harry Potter house is Gryffindor, I’m a Left-Twix, and I resonate most strongly with Chandler from Friends and the brown M&M. As my father once famously said: ""Once you choose brown, all the other colors let you down.""If any of the above sentences resonated with you, you may also share my love for personality tests. I love translating the depths of my psyche onto a five-point Likert scale or multiple choice response, startling myself with the “real” questions, like “Do I let others take charge of situations?” or “Am I an unusual person?” Is that something only a “usual” person would think? I love grounding myself in the idea that I am an original person who decides my destiny, and then having someone on the internet tell me exactly who I am, be it a professional psychologist or some content editor at Buzzfeed. I fully admit to the hypocrisy of saying I don’t believe people are meant to fit in neat boxes and then get excited when I neatly fit some psychologist’s purely made-up category, like the rarest Myers-Briggs subtype (not to brag). I know more personality tests are essentially pseudoscience disguised as “meaningful introspection.” Only a select few assessments have been shown to have any validity and reliability outside academia, resulting from both design and user error. I am asked to give quantifiable responses to intentionally vague questions, answers that I’ll most likely change the next time I take the same assessment. I’ll probably lie about how kind and organized I am because I obviously can’t let an objective computer algorithm judge my sins. Most importantly, I’m taking a test to better understand myself by answering questions that test how well I know my own behavior, which seems fundamentally counterintuitive. I think these questions will reveal some sort of inner foundation of myself, but what they actually reveal is a snapshot taken through some stranger’s lens, likely riddled with biases. These biases are highly amplified when personality testing is used as a hiring tool in businesses, an approach that has rightfully faced intense scrutiny for blatant racism, sexism, and ableism. Basing one’s promotion or firing based on 20 random questions and a jumble of letters is bound to have its ethical qualms. Nevertheless, according to the Harvard Business Review, personality testing is a $500 million industry, with growth rates estimated at 10 to 15% annually, and appeals to consulting firms, hedge funds, start-ups and university programs alike.Yet, I do see the value of having some external body call out your potential blind spots or adopt a whole new language to describe who you are. As a young person fumbling through adulthood like a potato falling down a staircase, I find myself making decisions and actions I can’t explain, aspects of myself that are somehow outside of my control. One of the most underrated facets of adolescence is this sudden boom in behavioral literacy and the realization that honing behavioral literacy is critical to navigating an increasingly complex world. Perhaps, then, personality tests serve as more of an act of self-preservation and self-care than an objective inquiry into something inherently subjective. Personality tests aren’t “scientific,” but self-understanding isn’t meant to be a scientific process. People are not meant to fit into categories, but maybe learning where some old guy thinks you fit in can be a productive exercise in learning about your own psychology (or more importantly, the inner psychology of that guy). And psychometrics shouldn’t be relied on for organizational decision-making, but maybe it can encourage you to be more self-compassionate. At the end of the day, personality testing requires the same mindset any psychologist would encourage when thinking about yourself: don’t take it too seriously.Nik Narain is a Trinity junior.

Strangers as angels,Luke A. Powery,2024-01-29T05:00:00Z,Jan,29,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/012924-powery-strangers-angels-20240129.html,"In the spring of 2000, I was 26 years old and had graduated from seminary the previous year. I was engaged to be married and spent most of my engagement overseas in France; you can imagine that went over well with my fiancée and soon-to-be-wife, Gail. I was spending two weeks at the Taizé Community in France on a postgraduate fellowship. And it was there where I wrestled with an unknown future. I had no job. Did not know what was next. I was going to get married, but I had no money and no house and — at the time — no car (somehow, I still thought I was a great catch!). Professional doors were closing, and I was stressed out about my next steps.As I struggled with my unknown future, on my final day at Taizé — unbeknownst to me — the Taizé brother who was my spiritual director for a week of silence asked Brother Roger, the founder and leader of the community, whether I could be their honored guest at lunch. Br. Roger agreed, and there I was in my sweatpants and athletic T-shirt seated at the middle of a long rectangle table with at least 50 Taizé brothers. Br. Roger had just returned from meeting with Pope John Paul II. He sat down in front of a small bouquet of flowers the brothers had given him. But Br. Roger told them to send the flowers down to me because I was their honored guest. I was a wandering, lost, anxious soul, not knowing what was next with doors being closed, but Br. Roger — a stranger — opened the door to me and welcomed me to the table. In my wilderness, he was an earthly angel.I say that because of one little linguistic signpost standing upright in a literary wilderness: “… And suddenly angels came and waited on him” (Matthew 4:11). This little phrase is tucked into the Bible’s dramatic account of Jesus’ temptation by the devil in the desert. As a reader, you could easily miss this sign of grace, but that seemingly “throw-away” line could be your lifeline. The Greek verb”‘wait” in this passage comes from a word linked to the word “diaconate” from which we get the word “deacon.” Now, there are Demon Deacons at Wake Forest University, but these are angel deacons — mysterious beings guarding and serving in the wilderness.We find a similar story in the life of the Rev. Howard Thurman, a spiritual mentor to many Civil Rights leaders. When he was only 14 years old, he left the comforts of home to pursue further education at a boarding school in Jacksonville, Florida since there was no high school for black children in Daytona Beach at that time. When he arrived at the train station to make his trip to Jacksonville, he was shocked to learn that while he had enough money for the fare, he needed more money to check his trunk. Thurman thought his adventure was doomed to end on that platform until an “anonymous stranger” approached him and asked him why he was crying. This stranger gave him the money he needed to get to Jacksonville, changing the trajectory of Thurman’s life. After he gave him the money, he walked away, and Thurman never saw him again. Thurman never forgot that act of kindness. It made such an imprint on him that he dedicated his autobiography, With Head and Heart, not to a well-known theologian or businessman or celebrity or family member, but to this stranger on the platform who “restored his broken dreams.” This stranger was Thurman’s angel.You might be experiencing tough times, your own wilderness. But I hope you don’t miss the deacons of God in your midst. Those little signposts of grace — “and suddenly angels came …” — can be so brief that you miss them amid the overwhelming abundance of temptations and human struggle. As the retired pastor Rev. Dr. J. Alfred Smith once preached: “Hope is a tiny sprout growing in cracked concrete.” Hope is so tiny, he is saying, that you can miss it. But I hope you have eyes to see the little sprout of grace, the flower blooming, the stranger as your angel.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel.

College enrollment is in free fall. Last year, a Wall Street Journal survey found that nearly 60% of Americans are skeptical of the value of a four-year degree — a 16-point swing from a decade prior. Perceived inadequacy in responding to antisemitism led to University of Pennsylvania president Liz Magill stepping down; Harvard president Claudine Gay was also forced to resign (but not before providing the world a timely reminder of what constitutes plagiarism). All of this occurred mere months after a Supreme Court ruling overturned race-conscious admissions and exposed many of the structural flaws embedded in the college admissions system.Even as Duke and its peers face a growing swell of critics, we cannot feign indifference toward their futures. The Ivies, Stanford, MIT, Chicago and Duke enroll less than 0.5% of Americans, but graduates from these 12 universities make up “more than 10% of Fortune 500 CEOs, a quarter of U.S. Senators, half of all Rhodes scholars, and three-fourths of Supreme Court justices.” The prestige of a university matters, and it matters because we have long believed that it should matter. These schools represent our hopelessly optimistic yet unyielding faith in meritocracy. They carry the American Dream on their backs.Yet the qualities that make the university the apotheosis of upward mobility also make it an easy target for attacks from across the political spectrum. In right-wing circles, pundits challenge diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies and castigate campuses as “Marxist indoctrination camps.” On the left, politicians have taken aim at admissions policies that privilege the rich, such as legacy preferences. In a polarized society, Republicans and Democrats may disagree on what ails us, but they can agree on one thing — universities are partly to blame. Take, for example, a bipartisan bill introduced in the House in December that denies federal student loans to any student that attends an elite private college like Duke. The Chronicle previously reported that this will impact 3,400 students at Duke who receive federal loans. If this legislation passes, it will merely create an additional obstacle in an environment that low-income students already struggle to navigate. Congress is, in effect, reaching to use private schools’ budgets as a piggy bank for problems that they cannot solve on their own.The House’s proposed student loan changes point toward a difficult truth: We are simply asking too much of our schools. Critics in Congress and the media cannot decry elite schools’ lack of socioeconomic diversity in one breath, and then strip away a vital means of improving it in the next. In a similar vein, conservatives have spent years lamenting the degradation of free speech policies on college campuses. Yet, university presidents’ commitment to those exact policies came back to haunt them when they were called to testify before Congress regarding antisemitism and responded to difficult questions like, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your school’s code of conduct?”, with, “It depends.” Certainly, their answers were unsatisfactory. But the inevitable result of attempting to please everyone is pleasing nobody. This is the central paradox of the elite university: It is simultaneously America’s crown jewel and its black sheep, an embodiment of everything this country can achieve and everything it has failed to thus far.Our eagerness to scapegoat colleges is making it harder to introspect on the pervasiveness of the challenges we face. Antisemitism and debates about DEI and free speech rage viciously outside of the university campus. The overrepresentation of upper-class and white students in elite schools stems from systemic problems in our educational system. The flaws of the university reflect a flawed society — one that struggles to grapple with difficult issues like inequality, intolerance and meritocracy. It is easy to blame Harvard for societal ills and hard to implement systemic change.Supporting rich, powerful institutions will not make you many friends; I want to be clear that this is not a blind defense of schools like Duke. University leaders should be held responsible for their failures. They should be condemned for policies that protect their self-interest at the expense of the common good. Nonetheless, it has become fashionable to denigrate the university and unfashionable to think it can do better. We must distinguish between those who criticize our schools because they value them and those who are praying for their downfall. You don’t need to love your university, but you should believe that its campus is worth fighting for.James Gao is a Trinity senior. His column typically runs on alternate Fridays."
The art of music snobbery,Susan Chemmanoor,2024-01-26T05:00:00Z,Jan,26,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/012624-chemmanoor-mitski-music-emotions-20240126.html,"When I first started listening to Mitski in 2019, I felt like I had discovered a prophet. Her lyrics felt like diary entries stolen from a night I had felt a little too honest. “Your Best American Girl” poked at the soft underbelly of insecurity I didn’t know I had. “A Burning Hill” made me rethink my relationship with work. Her music was a form of escapism.“Pink in the Night” was an especially spiritual experience. The first lines feel timid. The way the synth holds its high pitch in the background of Mitski’s terrified confession “I’ve been blossoming alone over you” is what holding your breath feels like. But then the levee breaks, and Mitski’s real feelings come pouring out. The synth drops away to reveal her unabashed truth: “I love you, I love you, I love you.” The music crescendos and suddenly you’re there. You’re standing on a rain-soaked road and the daylight is dead, but you finally feel alive. You feel the drums banging like a heartbeat in your sternum. Mitski’s voice is thunderous in your ears. She’s screaming for you to “try again and again and again.” The song makes love feel like a physical necessity. Vulnerability felt powerful.I was so emotionally invested in her music, that I started to feel a sort of strange ownership over it. I was naively convinced that no one understood her music like me. That emotional delusion lies at the core of music snobbery: feeling undeserved pride in listening to a non-mainstream artist. That music egoism is personified in Spotify Wrapped. On Nov. 29, 2023, the bell tolled for music lovers everywhere. The ground shook and fauna fled; it was Judgement Day. Spotify Wrapped had finally been delivered. It was a harrowing day for some: Drake deniers everywhere were “shocked” and “confused” seeing “IDGAF” in their top songs. But it was a joyous day for others, a data-supported validation for their insanely esoteric music taste. A chance to tell everyone they know they were in the 0.01% of Grimes listeners. It was cold, hard proof that they were special.And it’s entirely understandable, we all yearn to be different, to be unique. There is pride in exclusivity. We selfishly want complete ownership of the niche interests that feel so personal to us. When Mitski’s “Strawberry Blond” started to go viral on TikTok, I was so inexplicably angry. It was as if a personal sanctuary had been discovered and exploited. But Mitski doesn’t make music for only me. Mitski writes music for people who have been born anew. People who have been tugged and tugged until they’ve been broken and forced into restitching themselves — vein by vein, cell by cell. She makes music for the broken-hearted and people so hopelessly in love they don’t recognize themselves anymore. She makes her music for the jaded who feel like they’ve been forgotten by life itself. She sings for the joyous — people who have the sun bursting from the cavity where their hearts should be. She makes music for anyone who wants to listen. And isn’t that the point?Not to get all sentimental on you, but isn’t music more fun together? Screaming “Tongue Tied” by Grouplove in a friend-filled car is fun. Yelling “The Spins” by Mac Miller down a highway feels good. There’s joy hiding in the Spotify link you send to a friend. Pride glows in your chest as you watch a friend fall in love with your favorite artist. Life is better when everyone knows the song.Alternative music is not made to make people feel bad about listening to pop. It’s not made to form superiority complexes about only listening to shoegaze. Music is made to create community. It’s made to force you to feel. But, most of all, it is made to be enjoyed with the people you love, without judgment.So, if you’re going to be a music snob, at least be a nice one.Susan Chemmanoor is a Trinity first-year.

Under these towering oaks no more ,Aaron Siegle,2024-01-26T05:00:00Z,Jan,26,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/012624-siegle-under-towering-oaks-no-more-20240126.html,"“We’re gathered here today this afternoon on Abele Quad, the heart of West Campus, under the generous shade of these towering oak trees that seem as old as time.” These eloquent words conjure up a lucid memory in my mind. The unbearable heat of a Durham summer. The ominous threat of storm clouds, ready to unleash a fury of rain, thunder and lightning at any moment.This was my Freshman Convocation. The unpredictable weather was emblematic of my turbulent emotions during the first week of college: hope for an exciting adventure grappling with the sadness of what I had left behind. But in that moment, I took solace in one fact: the presence of these majestic oak trees, whom, in the words of President Price, “seem as old as time.” Regardless of the weather that day, whether it was 100 degree or a torrential downpour (turns out it was both), I could find refuge under the oak’s benevolent branches. However, I had no clue that the days of the oaks that “seem as old as time” were numbered. In fact, some of them are gone. Forever.In the hubbub amidst the renovation of Abele Quad for Duke’s centennial, it seems as if some of the old oaks were lost as collateral. Most prominently, the primordial Willow Oak (Quercus phellos) that gracefully extended its branches over Few Quad is no longer with us. In its place is a scrubby little tree, still recovering from root loss in the wake of transplant shock. Due to these injuries, it will take a while for this scant chap to mature into the glory of its predecessor. Recovering from transplant shock alone can take a tree up to five years.However, there is still hope. Many of the original impressive oaks that adorn Abele Quad have still not succumbed to the ax and the bulldozer. By emphasizing the cultural significance of trees in Duke’s history, as well as highlighting the ecological and human health benefits that mature trees provide, a flourishing future for these palatial monuments is possible. The oaks have survived the first hundred years of Duke’s turbulent history. Let’s make sure they’ll be around one hundred years from now.So, why are these trees worth preserving?Firstly, these trees are a part of Duke’s identity. When President Price spoke about the intrinsic value of the oaks on Abele Quad, he was wearing a medallion embellished with golden maple leaves and acorns. This same medallion is worn by former Duke President Terry Sanford in his official portrait hanging up in the Gothic Reading Room. Similarly, the ceilings of many historic buildings on West Campus are embroidered with the same leaf and acorn pattern. At an institution obsessed with symbolism, the recurring leaf design is no accident. Trees connote knowledge, introspection and resiliency — all values that Duke wants to incorporate into its scholarship.The political clout of trees is also not to be underestimated. Robert Moses, the man who built New York, found this lesson out the hard way. Moses had enormous political power. Despite evicting an estimated 500,000 New Yorkers over the course of his career, he seldom faced any significant threats to his authority. However, when Moses attempted to cut down a half-acre of trees in Central Park to build a parking lot for a nearby restaurant, he was met with a firestorm of opposition and eventually backed down.The political significance of these trees did not stem from their comeliness or grandeur but rather was a result of their location. Central Park is perhaps the world’s most famous park and is deemed sacred ground by New Yorkers. In the same way, Abele Quad is Duke’s Central Park. Like Central Park, the most defining aspects of Duke’s history have occurred on Abele Quad.These old oaks witnessed the student occupation of the Allen Building and subsequent attack by the Durham Police, a turning point in the fight for racial justice at Duke. Under their branches walked civil rights icons Martin Luther King Jr. and Stolkey Carmichael. Their leaves have reflected the hues of countless bench burnings, concerts and parties. And their limbs continue to provide generous shade to those fighting for a better world today, whether it be those advocating for divestment from fossil fuels, student unionization or greater employee rights.Well, weren’t the trees that chopped down dying anyway? Most Oak trees in the Southeast US can live for around 300 years, though oaks in the UK commonly live over 1,000 years. Despite this impressive longevity, it could still be quite possible that the oaks on Abele Quad were dying, whether it was due to disease or impacts from construction.But that shouldn’t be a reason to cut them down.Dead oaks are just as ecologically valuable as living ones. A plethora of animals, ranging from birds to salamanders, rely on snags (dead trees that are still standing) for shelter. More than 80 species of birds in North America depend on snags for their survival. The slow decomposition of wood creates a whole new ecosystem of insects, which help restore natural processes in the global carbon cycle. Snags keep their root system, which helps stabilize the soil — something that a transplanted tree who just had most of its roots cut off can’t do.I understand that saving a few trees on Abele Quad isn’t going to restore global biodiversity. But that’s not the point. Keeping snags would be a living testament to Duke’s commitment to the environment, a teaching tool about the paradoxical realities of ecology. Persuasive storytelling is integral to any environmental initiative, and I cannot think of a more effective storyteller than a tree, communicating Duke’s history through the curve of its trunk, the holes in its bark and the expanse of its canopy.The centennial is a time when we are supposed to celebrate Duke’s history — not destroy it. Trees symbolize our collective memory, making it appropriate for trees to be at the physical and moral center of an institution designed to expand knowledge.Trees can be treated as an expendable ornament or an iconic embodiment of ideals — but not both.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity sophomore.

A realist's perspective on grade inflation,Alex Berkman,2024-01-25T05:00:00Z,Jan,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/012524-berkman-grade-inflation-prevent-learning-20240125.html,"Grade inflation exists at Duke, and the stats support it. Per the spring 2023 Dean's List, for first-year students in Trinity, the top 15% GPA cutoff was a 4.0; the top 25% cut off a 3.962.But what about Pratt? Everyone knows Pratt is much harder. Well, for Pratt, the top 15% cutoff was 3.962, and the top 25% was 3.924.But students’ grades must decline throughout college, right? Well, for Seniors in Trinity, the top 15% cutoff was 3.950, and the top 25% was 3.916. Similarly, for Seniors in Pratt, the top 15% cutoff was 3.930 and the top 25% was 3.899. Now, two options may explain this phenomenon: (1) Duke students are smarter and more hardworking than they’ve ever been, or (2) Duke has gone soft. Now, while the former may be true, there is no clear explanation to support this. There is, however, a basis to the claim that Duke has gotten easier — numerous tactics have been implemented to alleviate the stress of test taking. During the height of the pandemic, universities introduced major changes to the way students learned and were tested. The most popular reform was a move to asynchronous learning — i.e. recorded lectures and take-home exams. This was particularly convenient, given that many students either were not able to or chose to not attend in-person classes. In fact, universities generally moved away from testing altogether, recognizing the additional stresses students faced outside the classroom. When there were tests, students would be provided “cheat sheets” — an 8 x 11 study guide — only, you were allowed to use it during the test. Of note, “cheat sheets” had been introduced prior to 2020, but their presence was augmented during the pandemic. In addition, it became notably easier to take a course on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) basis, allowing students to maintain their high GPAs by bypassing the existence of a “C,” “B” or maybe even an “A-” on their transcript.When COVID-19 became largely under control, Duke professors had a question to address: Do we revert back to the style of pre-pandemic learning or incorporate aspects of pandemic learning into the present curriculum?The latter was selected, and who can blame them? Long has been the discussion of how we can reduce stress among students while maintaining the level of learning, and it appeared a solution had been found. Therefore, S/U grading policy, recorded lectures and take-home exams were all here to stay. When the introductory public policy course was switched to the mandatory Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory system this year, Professor of Political Science Nicolas Carnes argued that, “This is the rare time where you can make a policy change and have only upsides,” because it reduces “student stress without reducing student learning.” In addition, this switch to S/U-only grading also encourages students to be unafraid to explore their academic interests without fear of hurting their GPA. Such was the logic when Econ 101, formerly a weed-out course, switched to S/U-only grading system in 2019. Today, in Econ 101 (having taken the course this past semester), hardly anyone even takes the final exam. So, what’s the problem?Well, the problem is that the current strategy does reduce student learning and this innovative curriculum change — as it was put forth — is not at all innovative. It’s just plain easier. Trust me, as a beneficiary of grade inflation, I recognize that my argument is inherently self-sabotaging, but there are two major issues that arise when it becomes significantly easier to do well in school — the first being that students never learn the value of failing. I have a friend who took 300-level Spanish this past semester, which is intended for highly advanced speakers. The only issue is that my friend's Spanish ability is limited to “¡Hola!”, “¿Cómo estás?” and “Adiós.” Nevertheless, with minimal effort I may note, he maintained an “A” average for most of the semester and finished with a “A-.” When he learned of the horrifying news of his “A-,"" he highly contemplated using one of his four S/U credits. In the end, he chose to stick it out with the “A-,"" and for that I am proud of him. I mean, isn’t he just the bravest man in the world?On many occasions, peers of mine have similarly expressed their fear of receiving an “A-.” An “A-!!!” God forbid a student receive an “A-” at a top-10 university in the United States, and yet this is the reality for many at Duke.As we know, there are no “A's” or “A-’s” in the workplace. You either perform or you don’t, and knowing how to overcome adversity is essential. Thus, while becoming accustomed to failure is not what we should seek, becoming comfortable responding to failure is. In the current atmosphere at Duke, not only does hyper grade inflation diminish the value of true achievement, it also shields us from a reality that does not deliberately accommodate our success. The second issue with the state of the curriculum is that students are less likely to learn effectively if the stakes of exams are drastically lowered. In spring 2023, I enrolled in “STA 101: Data Analysis and Statistical Inference” to fulfill one of my Quantitative Science (QS) credits. The class began with 120 people, but since attendance was not mandatory and all sessions were recorded, a once large lecture transformed into a seminar-like experience. As students watched lectures from the comfort of their own bed rather than face to face with their professor, one may only assume that learning was diminished. In the case of Stats 101, the course content was difficult — at least for me, who had never coded before and had anticipated an AP Stats-style course rather than one entirely based in “R Studio.” However, the only two exams were take-home, and students were given a week to complete them while having full access to any and all available resources. May I repeat this: Any and all available resources. Now, some professors will argue that in the “real world,” students possess complete access to the internet and all the content it holds; thus, we should replicate this environment during test taking. However, students will never fully grasp the material as well as they would have if they could only rely on themselves and their knowledge to complete exams. In addition, when incentives to study decrease — such as when cheat sheets are allowed or take-home exams are introduced — the incentive to properly master the material as we otherwise would have also decreases. As someone who received an “A” in this course and yet in no way feels prepared to take 200 level statistics or — better yet — apply these skills in the workplace, I am a first-hand account of this. Yes, of course, I recognize that many and likely most students are self-motivated and driven by the pursuit of knowledge. But let’s just say it how it is. Duke students also care about grades; therefore, when a short cut is offered, it is not irrational to presume that a notable portion of the student body would take advantage. When intense course loads and extracurriculars mean that students are already crunched for time, who can really blame them?Some may call me a traitor for writing this piece. Honestly, I deserve it. I mean, what type of student demands that school be harder? Well, I guess I am.Alex Berkman is a Trinity sophomore. His column typically runs on alternate Tuesdays."
We will not wait for the next school shooting,"Andrew Sun, Alexander Denza",2024-01-24T14:00:00Z,Jan,24,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/012424-sun-denza-school-shooting-20240124.html,"Author's Note: We are a collective of 144 student leaders representing 90 student groups across the nation, spanning progressive causes of every kind, and standing in solidarity with gun violence prevention. Today, more than 50 student newspapers are publishing our letter, addressed to students. Our nation is asking for a student-led conversation around gun violence without school shooting as its pretext, a conversation charged with hope rather than with fear. We’re not going to wait for the next school shooting to happen. Students are taught to love a country that values guns over our lives.Some of us hear the sound of gunfire when we watch fireworks on the Fourth of July, or when we watch a drumline performance at halftime. But all of us have heard the siren of an active shooter drill and fear that one day our campus will be next.By painful necessity, we have grown to become much more than students learning in a classroom — we have shed every last remnant of our childhood innocence. The steady silence of Congress is as deafening as gunfire.We will not wait for individual trauma to affect us all before we respond together — our empathy is not that brittle. Our generation responds to shootings by bearing witness and sharing solidarity like none other. We text each other our last thoughts and we cry on each others’ shoulders and we mourn with each other at vigils. We convene in classrooms and we congregate in churches and we deliberate in dining halls. We’re staunch and we’re stubborn and we’re steadfast.Our hearts bleed from this uniquely American brand of gun violence. Yet, we still summon the courage to witness firework shows and remind ourselves that we love our country so much that we expect better from it. We believe that our country has the capacity to love us back. There are bullet-shaped holes in our hearts, but our spirits are unbreakable.History has taught us that when injustice calls students to act, we shape the moral arc of this country.Students in the Civil Rights Movement shared their stories through protest, creating the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) that organized Freedom Rides, sit-ins and marches. In demanding freedom from racial violence, this group’s activism became woven into American history. Students across America organized teach-ins during the Vietnam War to expose its calculated cruelties — in doing so, rediscovering this country’s empathy. Their work, in demanding freedom from conscription and taxpayer-funded violence, is intertwined with the American story.This fall, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill students’ text exchanges during the August 28th shooting reached the hands of the President. The nation read the desperate words of our wounded community, as we organized support, rallied and got thrown out of the North Carolina General Assembly. We demanded freedom from gun violence, just as we have in Parkland and Sandy Hook and Michigan State University and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.For 360,000 of us since Columbine, the toll of bearing witness, of losing our classmates and of succumbing to the cursed emotional vocabulary of survivorship has become our American story.Yes, it is not fair that we must rise up against problems that we did not create, but the organizers of past student movements know from lived experience that we decide the future of the country.The country watched student sit-ins at Greensboro, and Congress subsequently passed civil rights legislation. The country witnessed as students exposed its lies about Vietnam, and Congress subsequently withdrew from the war. In recent years, the country watched student survivors march against gun violence, and the White House subsequently created the National Office of Gun Violence Prevention in September 2023. So as students and young people alike, we should know our words don’t end on this page — we will channel them into change. We invite you to join this generation’s community of organizers, all of us united in demanding a future free of gun violence. We understand the gravity of this commitment, because it's not simply our lives we protect with prose and protest. It is our way of life itself. We will not allow America to be painted in a new layer of blood. We will not allow politicians to gamble our lives for NRA money.And most of all, politicians will not have the shallow privilege of reading another front-cover op-ed by students on their knees, begging them to do their jobs — we do not need a permission slip to defend our freedoms. They will instead contend with the reality that by uniting with each other and among parents, educators and communities, our demands become undeniable. We feel intense anger and frustration and sadness, and in its wake, we search for reaffirmations of our empathy — the remarkable human capacity to take on a tiny part of someone else’s suffering. We rediscover this fulfillment in our organizing, in our community, in not just moving away from the unbearable pain of our yesterday but in moving toward an unrelenting hope for our tomorrow.Our generation dares politicians to look us in the eye and tell us they’re too afraid to try.Andrew Sun, a Trinity junior, and Alexander Denza, a UNC-Chapel Hill senior, are UNC-Chapel Hill March For Our Lives organizers.Signed,Abby Saks ‘24, Duke Climate Coalition Co-presidentAmaia Clayton ‘27, Duke Students for Gun Safety DirectorAlyssa Ho ‘26, (Chronicle staff photographer)Ameya Rao ‘24Ana Beatriz Sales ‘26Andrea Reyes ‘25, Duke American Grand Strategy Co-ChairAngela Chen ‘27, Freshman Class President and DSG Senator (Chronicle contributor)Ashley Bae ‘24, DSG Executive Vice President and Duke KAjok PresidentBenjamin Greene ‘27, DSG SenatorCarina Lei ‘25, Asian Students Association Co-PresidentCeline Wang ‘25Chloe Decker ‘25, Duke Votes Coordinating CommitteeChristina Liang ‘24Coral Lin ‘25, Our Urban Future Co-presidentDay Kim ‘27Drew Greene ‘24Emma Chun ‘24Erika Pietrzak ‘25Felicia Wang ‘25Hiba Benjeddou ‘25Isabel Barrios ‘27Jack Morgenstein ‘25Jack Sabo ‘27, (Chronicle staff writer)Jax Nalley ‘25, DSG Director of Educational Equity and Student SuccessJoshua Lopez ‘26Joy Reeves, Second-year Environmental Economics & Policy MEM candidate at the Nicholas School of the EnvironmentJulia Young ‘26, Duke Polis ExecKatie Seithel ‘25, Duke Human Rights Student Advisory BoardKaitlyn Maher ‘25Kennedy Robinson ‘25, Duke Engineers for International Development Co-PresidentLaura Poma Gomez ‘24, Vice President of the Zeta Mu Chapter of Lambda Theta Alpha Latin Sorority, Inc.Lucy Huo ‘25May Fu ‘25, (Chronicle graphics editor)Millie Caughey ‘25Nikhil Methi ‘27Noor Nazir ‘27Pilar Kelly ‘24, Duke Votes Chair (Chronicle opinion managing editor)Priscilla Kang ‘27Rae Rackley ‘27Robin Koshelev ‘27Saisha Dhar ‘25Thomas Henry ‘27Thorin Chappel ‘24, Visions of Freedom LLC PresidentWinslow Tracy ‘27Yadira Paz-Martinez ‘25, DSG Vice President of Equity and Outreach and Co-President of Duke Define AmericaZara Thalji ‘25Zoe Farris ‘27"
Motivation isn’t enough: Here’s how to achieve your goals,Anna Garziera,2024-01-24T05:00:00Z,Jan,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/012424-garziera-motivation-not-enough-20240124.html,"Here we are at the start of a new semester. As we become reacquainted with our dorm rooms, discover new classrooms and reclaim old routines, it can feel automatic to simply fall back into the mechanism of things. With the new year just begun, many of us have made resolutions — and resolved to actually stick to our resolutions this time.However, our motivations counter each other.On one hand, we want to re-adapt to life as it was before Christmas break. We were cozy, even in our daily struggles. On the other hand, we want things to change for the better. I’m talking about all of the strides we set out to make each year to improve our lives. Big steps towards a big future. Drink more water. Go to office hours. Don’t wait until the last night to study for a test.Spring is on the horizon. The air tastes like new beginnings. But, as we have learned from years passed, this is not enough. The new year will not even boost us with enough good-willed motivation to last until February, let alone the end of the semester.What a dilemma we are stuck in. Every new year we want change but fail to attain it.When considering what the forces that drive change might be, it is natural to look at the world around us. By analyzing how others have achieved change in the past, we can begin to assess the different strategies, and perhaps even think about applying some to our own lives. In this spirit, I consulted some Southgate residents to come up with ways that we think could help Duke students trigger change.The first key step is setting goals that are as specific as possible. Take a student that found last semester’s math class particularly challenging and was not able to achieve a B+ in the class due to some poor test scores. His first impulse might be to simply “study more” this time around. While this goal allows for some flexibility, this extreme vagueness will not help but harm him. Instead, it might be more productive to set out to review class notes at the end of each lecture to ingrain concepts more deeply.The second step is taking small, reasonable steps towards your goal, rather than trying to achieve it all at once. You’ve heard it before: set reasonable goals for the new year, or you’ll find yourself disappointed by the time December rolls around. However, some of us are naturally very ambitious, especially here at Duke. There is no denying that some of us like to aim high. Then, goals do not have to be reduced, but simply achieved in small steps, each of which should feel easy. Call it a smooth transition.Well then, what does this look like?Say you slept late and skipped breakfast at Marketplace (and a few too many of your morning lectures) last semester, and you decide to wake up earlier this time around. As we have just learned, “waking up earlier” is vague goal. Then, say you decide on 7:30 a.m.But you did not “fix your sleep schedule” over break as you had set yourself out to do, and instead, you slept until noon every day. Waking up at 7:30 a.m. might feel impossible. However, if you break this goal down into chunks, you might realize it will only take you two weeks to adjust and not feel like a wreck if you just set your alarm back twenty minutes each day. It’s not a perfect fix, especially if you have morning classes, but with some adjustments, this plan is much more likely to work than no plan at all. Two weeks will go by before you know it.The last issue is that often times, we tend to rely on our internal motivation to lead us towards our goals. This often does not work because there is nothing that keeps us accountable. Instead, self-imposed pre-commitments can do wonders for our motivation, because now some extrinsic reward is on the line. Let me explain: We still might not find the strength to go on a run every morning, even if we set a clear mile goal or start with short runs. Yet, by enrolling into a PE class, we suddenly have an external motive for showing up to the gym to work out: our class grade depends on it. As it turns out, this is exactly why some students decided to join Fusion Fitness for Women, taught by Ms. Maria Finnegan, this semester. Our drive is surprisingly fleeting. As motivated as we might think we are, sometimes we need something to anchor us down.There are other strategies that can work for ambitious students and adults. Some make vision boards, others cover their walls with motivational quotes, others still write their resolutions list over and over again, put it under their pillow at night and quite literally “sleep on it.” Nevertheless, there lies a common thread among all of these tried-and-often-failed strategies: That even with their aid, less than one in ten Americans stick to their resolutions every year.In a way, it is true to say that change will happen only when it needs to happen. In other words, a breaking point will eventually be reached where change will become inevitable. One Southgate resident I talked to summarized this idea nicely: “If you wait that long to start achieving something, how badly do you really want it?”Then, goals should be dynamic. The way of achieving them is to carry them across the years, and looking at the long-term picture, let our goals shift with our current state. At the end of the day, it is not our future self that will be asked to work towards that goal, but our current self.Regardless how you set out to achieve your goals this year, try to remember that effort is a marker of change. DukeEngage’s motto reminds us of this: “Challenge yourself, change your world.” Only through hard work and honest introspection might we be able to set realistic goals this year — and actually stick with them.Anna Garziera is a Trinity freshman.

New pre-professional society to focus on bumming around,Monday Monday,2024-01-22T06:22:00Z,Jan,22,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/012224-monday-monday-pre-professional-society-20240122.html,"It’s the start of the spring semester, and Duke’s highly selective organizations have descended upon campus to recruit impressionable underclassmen into their ranks. Potential recruits can look forward to a new organization to add to the expansive list: the last DSG Senate hearing saw the charter approval of Beta Upsilon Mu — Duke’s newest pre-professional organization for students who reject pre-professionalism.Senior Kyle Klimber, president of Beta Upsilon Mu, spoke at the DSG hearing about the need for the new club: “So much of selective social life at Duke is oriented toward people who have their s*** together. Where is the selective social life for those of us who don’t?”“Not everyone needs to have a five, 10 or 15-year plan,” continued Klimber, who plans to travel around Europe after graduation on a year-long trip paid for by his dad who works at an investment banking firm. “Beta Upsilon Mu is Duke’s premier self-discovery-focused organization that fosters an environment of access and a home for students seeking a more real Duke experience,” reads the statement on the organization’s website, “Beta Upsilon Mu promotes an innovative, cutting-edge rigorous approach to chillaxing.” “It’s so refreshing to be a part of a community that isn’t focused on ‘pre-professionality’ and ‘making money.’ I want a place where I can just chill and be me, you know?” said sophomore Shtatas Quo, who spent his winter break on a journey of self discovery fueled by psychedelics . Beta promises admits a robust set of resources to aid in post-graduation ventures, including an alumni network boasting esteemed Duke graduates in jobs like professional ice sculpture maker, Etsy craftsmanship and podcasting. Beta Upsilon Mu also offers its members a six to eight week training program with weekly tutorials and presentations on topics like business analysis, self-analysis, exercises in meditation and joint-rolling classes. While most pre-professional societies do not have a residential section, Beta Upsilon Mu members creatively promote residential connections by commandeering a new common room to couch-surf in every week.“I love Beta Upsilon,” said junior Brother Lelove, ""It gives me a space where I feel like I can just be myself. And our rush chairs ensure that only total chillers get in.”Following the charter approval, Beta brothers were spotted on Abele Quad alternating between reading deeply philosophical literature, pondering life and overall having a great time not going to class. Beta Upsilon Mu rush takes place the first week of February. First-week rush events include information sessions with times of “whenever, you’re all going to show up late anyway,” and themes of “vibe sesh!” By deploying various AI-generated quips and personality quirks and integrating 20 different Google Calendars, Monday Monday has finally been able to rush every single selective organization on campus.

I'm glad It's Thyme replaced Panda ,Heidi Smith,2024-01-22T05:00:00Z,Jan,22,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/012224-smith-glad-its-thyme-replaced-panda-20240122.html,"Coming back from winter break for Duke’s 100th year, our gothic wonderland didn’t look much different than before, save for slightly fewer orange cones. One would think that after all the money and time Duke poured into tearing apart and reconstructing campus, we would at least have solved the issue of the small pond that forms in front of WU and Kilgo when it rains — alas. However, one positive has emerged from the rubble: It’s Thyme finally replaced Panda Express.This restaurant swappage has not come without controversy. Word on the street is that this is a horrible decision, Duke hates its students, and the Good Old Days are gone. While I have been around here long enough to lament the departure of a time where the $5 deal was a full meal instead of two boiled eggs, one piece of string cheese and one piece of fruit, in this case, the change to our food options is positive.I’ll start by saying I love bowl-themed restaurants — give me Chipotle, Sweetgreen, or Cava any day and I will be a happy girl. As a picky eater, I appreciate the ability to customize without seeming high maintenance. Further, the variety of plant-based toppings at It’s Thyme allows me to trick myself into — dare I say — enjoying eating my vegetables. Additionally, it has enough options that I don’t just order the same bowl every time, like I do at Sazon or Ginger + Soy. Plus, the employees are exceptionally nice.The two main arguments I’ve heard against It’s Thyme are that it removes a connection to heritage for Chinese students and that it’s expensive. I understand the urge to indulge in a home-cooked meal while living on campus, but there are some problems with this. Namely, by design of the diverse liberal arts university: we all have different food cultures, you can’t cheaply mass produce home-cooked meals and authentic cuisine was never the goal of fast food restaurants — Panda included. In other words, by coming here, we’re agreeing that we’re going to have to learn to feed ourselves differently than we are used to, which is a difficult task.I don’t intend to sound flippant about this, but I would never expect a Duke restaurant to serve schnitzel, spaetzle, or strudel — a few of the foods I associate closely with my roots. But before you get the wrong idea, my qualms with Panda were never in its type of cuisine, but that it serves entirely ultra-processed foods (UPFs) — save for the white rice — and I would have the same opinion if it were McDonald’s leaving campus.Indeed, I would say that many students critique the restaurants serving cuisine similar to home-cooked meals — personally, I’m almost never satisfied when I get pasta from Il Forno. Food that is but a simulacrum of what we are familiar with can temporarily scratch an itch, but it will not address the root desire of wanting a real, home-cooked meal. Thus, the recent movement in Duke Dining towards more dietarily inclusive, healthy options — while it does, admittedly, seem a form of virtue signaling — is a net positive for us students.Sadly, however, in America, our government and culture incentivize UPFs, making it such that whole foods and prepared meals made from real ingredients are more expensive on the front end. While you save money now on fast food — which you cannot deny that Panda is — you have to pay later with your health. Yes, it would be best if all of us could cook our own meals, but that’s just not realistic for busy college students living primarily in dorms, so we must do the best we can with what is available.Yes, the healthier options on campus are more expensive, mirroring broader societal trends. In order to address inequalities which can stem from this, it would be great if Duke Financial Aid would do something similar for dining as they do for housing. As a student on significant aid, Duke pays for the cost difference of me to have a single room but would not increase my aid if I got a larger dining plan. In other words, I can live in a Hollows single for the same total cost as I would in a Keohane double, but if I were to choose food plan B instead of A, I would eat the cost.Panda Express was less expensive than It’s Thyme, for sure, but when we compare It’s Thyme to other WU stalwarts, it’s pretty similar. In my experience this year, I tend to pay 11 or 12 dollars for lunch and dinner, maybe a bit more if I spring for salmon from Farmstead or J.B.’s. Compared to the cost of living in my rural Ohio hometown, frankly, everything on campus and in Durham is outrageously expensive, and if Duke did not pay for my board, I would feel incredibly guilty about spending so much money on food.Now I am brought back to the point about home-cooked meals. I almost guarantee you, your family or whoever cooked for you growing up made meals out of ingredients rather than things like l-cysteine hydrochloride, caramel color, disodium guanylate or maltodextrin. I’m just copying and pasting these from the Panda Express ingredients list, but if you poke around on NetNutrition, you’ll probably find more of the same from many of the other restaurants on campus.It’s Thyme’s entire idea is to provide an option on campus serving whole foods. The food items people are used to eating — like those historically obtained through hunting, gathering or cultivating — tend to be rather perishable and thus more expensive to use for commercial food purposes. Normal humans cooking at home often prepare meals with ingredients rather than the “edible foodlike substances” that comprise UPFs. No matter what your culture is, your ancestors did this because they did not have access to the ultraprocessed contaminants. No matter what type of cuisine it models, adding a restaurant that is trying to serve real food is an unambiguous win in my book.If Duke’s recent centennial reminded me anything, it’s that the Duke brand is so comparatively young. Surprisingly, it’s not any older than my late grandparents. So much about this place is different now than it was in 1924. If anything, this should cause us to question aspects about our present that are still less than ideal, rather than lamenting the shifting currents of our university that have brought us to where we are today. I can only hope that come 2124 — if we ever make it there — and Duke’s bicentennial, students of the future are questioning why the university allowed its students to eat such nutritiously questionable options. I hope, as a student body, we can at least entertain the merits of swapping Panda Express for It’s Thyme rather than immediately spitting out gut reactions that shut down the possibility of more nuanced discourse.Heidi Smith is a Trinity senior.

DukeEngage DC Democracy at Risk: An unlikely ally,Gabrielle Mollin,2024-01-19T05:17:00Z,Jan,19,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/011924-mollin-democracy-unlikely-ally-20240119.html,"As campus conversations begin to spiral about finding the right summer internship, I can’t help but think about my time last summer at DukeEngage’s Democracy at Risk program. Upon arriving in D.C., I had my work cut out for me. Our program’s goal of helping fix American democracy was lofty, and on top of that, I would be working for the “other side.” This Republican organization was committed to defeating Donald Trump in 2024, even if it meant turning against the majority of the Republican Party. Yet as I embarked on my internship at Longwell Partners, where I would devote hours a day filming testimonials with two-time Trump voters regarding their decision to move on from the indicted, impeached and immoral former president for the 2024 election, I often found myself wondering: how did our country get here? In search of answers, I quickly found my way back to a trusty book from my political science class at the start of my first year at Duke that I’d brought along as a D.C. read (thanks Professor Vanberg). As I opened my heavily annotated copy of “How Democracies Die,” I slowly peeled off the first pink sticky note I saw and dove into the section on the “closet autocrat,” where I soon found some answers. The “closet autocrat” bore all too many similarities to the man I’d spent my whole summer crusading against: Donald Trump. The chapter explained the nuances of outsider politicians — how they can rise to the top of a democratic institution with “rebel appeal” despite closeted disdain for democratic values. As Donald Trump campaigned to label the media and political opponents as ""terrorists,"" with which his followers swiftly agreed, it became easier for him to justify actions against such groups and our democracy as he took the White House and fought back against leaving it. Even further, because Trump’s claim to fame deepened our culture of polarization and hostility, his words had a “boomerang effect.” Threatened, the media ditched restraint and professionalism in an attempt to undermine the government. Embattled, political opponents ditched restraint and professionalism in an attempt to undermine the government. The very people and institutions Trump baselessly condemned turned into what his voters feared most. So it seems Trump invented a democratic crisis to get elected, but then he created that very crisis by stoking fear throughout his base. And when people are afraid, it’s easier for them to support quasi-authoritarian expansions of executive power (look at public favor for the USA PATRIOT Act after 9/11 or for Japanese internment camps during WW2). When these crises are invented by demonizing political rivals, thereby furthering polarization, politicians like Trump may feel justified to employ any means necessary to defeat opponents. And even if such actions are antidemocratic, citizens support them because they too fear the opponent. But while Trump poses a definitive threat to our democracy, his power came from a fault within our political system: people don't feel represented by their government. On nearly every testimonial call I had while interning at Longwell, two-time Trump voters cite Trump’s business skills and real-life experience as his primary appeal in 2016. Though they grew to resent his narcissism and vindictive rhetoric, Trump’s uninhibited politics managed to break down the barrier between most everyday Americans and the political sphere. So while Trump arguably embodies patient zero for the deep polarization that infects American society, he also signals a yearning within the American public for their politicians to fulfill Lincoln’s famed national promise of “government of the people, for the people, and by the people.”The Republican firm I worked at knew where our democracy was headed with Trump, and like me, they wanted to change it. My friends jeered at me, a left-leaning New Yorker, spending eight weeks in a D.C. office with a bunch of Republicans. I laughed along, but after some time I didn’t find their jokes all that funny. Republican or not, the people at Longwell were committed to our democracy. They were committed to defending their party from Donald Trump. And they were committed to including me in the process, even though they knew I belonged to a different side of the political spectrum. What good was it to laugh at this group who had only been honorable in my eyes? Now I’m no democracy expert, but I do know people. I know how easy it is to judge, to criticize, to laugh. I know it’s tempting to write off your political opponents when you’ve never even spoken to them, fomenting caricatures of uninformed bigots. I used to do that. But after talking with Stephen from South Carolina, Ross from Utah, Joanna from Tennessee and many more two-time Trump voters around the country who are now committed to his exile from the Republican party, I came to see our country in a new light.I’m miles away from identifying with the Republican party, but I can no longer impose false narratives onto their voter base. And even though I never fully agreed with these people, I came to understand them. They were scared. They were angry. They were isolated. They wanted change. And I want change for them. We cannot continue to exclude them from our political future; that’s why we are where we are today. Continued isolation will only bring about more polarization, which will only further damage our democracy. We should know better by now. So instead of sticking with people who think like me, comfortably yet critically looking down at the “other,” I spent my summer in deep conversation with fellow Americans whom I once foolishly perceived as the enemy, working together towards a common cause many want to claim as their own. And now, I’m urging you to try something like it … you might be surprised. Gabrielle Mollin is a Trinity sophomore. Her column typically runs on alternate Thursdays."
Banning ChatGPT won’t stop cheating,Aaron Price,2024-01-19T05:00:00Z,Jan,19,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/011924-price-banning-chatgpt-cheating-20240119.html,"Ah, the first day of class. You brush your hair, show up on time and pick your seat for the rest of the semester (or, at least, for the days you end up attending). The professor goes through the usual spiel of accessing the course website, the grading scheme and a little about them. As they share the syllabus and read the Duke Community Standard, you notice something new — the class policy on the use of AI.With the launch of ChatGPT less than a year and a half ago, the entire school system is scrambling to figure out how to adapt. Essays can be generated in seconds, coding problems solved with copy and pasting and reflections done with minimal prompting. Some schools have chosen to ban the use of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT completely, whereas other educators have embraced it.Duke has provided recommendations to professors on AI policies but ultimately has given autonomy to teachers to decide their class rules. My classes have decided to either ban the use of LLMs or allow them when cited and used as an auxiliary tool (usually with points deducted as a result). But, allow me to let you in on a little secret: Regardless of professor policies on AI use, some (arguably many) students are going to use ChatGPT to aid or fully complete their assignments. This isn’t because students want to cheat, but rather because their classes aren’t serving their learning interests. Goal misalignment between students and Duke’s curriculum is causing the rampant use of ChatGPT on assignments.To understand this, we must first consider why students go to college. There’s a lack of survey data at Duke around this idea, but through informal interviews I’ve deciphered three main reasons. One, it was expected or the clear next step. Two, to get a better job. And three, for the social experience. Only a small group of students choose to attend college primarily out of love for intellectual discovery.The problem is that institutions of higher education view this small group as the main reason the majority of students attend college. So, classes focus on theory with little connection to the real world or the lives and goals of students.I know way too many students with 4.0 GPAs in computer science that can’t create an API, much less call one. This is fundamental to the role of software engineers (the career outcome most computer science students strive for). Instead, students spend 40 hours in a single week designing a basic computer for one class — something less relevant to the role most strive for. So, it starts to make sense that students cheat, using LLMs to get work done faster. Our classes feel like a distraction from our goals.Ignoring the group of students who go to college because it was expected, which is inherently satisfied, our classes are not aiding in our other two motivators: increased career opportunity and social experience. So, students are taking their education into their own hands. They use ChatGPT to give themselves more time to focus on job preparation and socializing. In computer science, this means using AI to quickly complete assignments to enable working on Leetcode interview questions, side projects or tenting in KVille. And using LLMs to cheat is actually preparing students for careers. A recent survey found 92% of professional software engineers use generative AI while they code. So this is actually preparing them for the tools they will use in the workforce.Duke selects ambitious and exceptional undergraduates. Wouldn’t it be more concerning if students didn’t try to orient their time towards their goals?One student told me that he uses ChatGPT to provide more example problems and tutoring, essentially giving him access to 24/7 office hours. If we ban the use of AI, we are harming him without actually affecting the cheaters. There are a million other ways to cheat. If classes continue to fail to provide the value students hope to derive from college, it won’t matter if AI is banned or not. Students will always find a way to cheat. Banning AI only hurts the students who use it to aid their in-class learning. If we really want to stop cheating, Duke could makes classes more aligned with student goals by providing more project based courses, emphasizing real world impact, and nurturing class community. So I urge us to think past the idea that banning the use of AI will stop cheating. Rather, let’s tackle the root cause of why students are using AI to cheat. It’s not because they’re lazy, but rather because they’re choosing to take agency over their collegiate experience and derive the value they desire from college.Aaron Price is a Trinity senior.

It’s not too soon to say that QuadEx is failing,Gabriel Reis,2024-01-19T05:00:00Z,Jan,19,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/011924-reis-quadex-failing-20240119.html,"Coming to Duke was a daunting experience. As an international student whose first language is not English, the anxiety to fit in couldn’t be more suffocating. But I never felt desperate or lost. I quickly met people in my hallway and FOCUS classes going through the same challenging changes. That brought us close together, and this new chapter of my life soon didn’t seem so stressful. That’s when I found the first community I felt I truly belonged at Duke: my freshman dorm, Southgate.Soon, I had established meaningful connections with my fellow residents and found a valuable, caring mentor in my faculty-in-residence. Every night, I found myself excited to go back to my dorm and meet my new friends in the common room or the kitchen. It was truly one of the best parts of my freshman year. University officials promised me this community would be preserved for the rest of my college experience. After all, isn’t that what QuadEx is all about? They made me look forward to continuing living in that fun, inclusive and welcoming community. From their messaging, I felt as if it was already a reality on West Campus quads.Well, it was not.Last semester — the first of my sophomore year — I saw that community I loved so dearly completely vanish. I don't see my Southgate friends anymore. We grew apart. I'm in a hallway full of strangers. Last semester, after joining Quad Council to foster connections in my new home, I was heartbroken to see most of our (and other residential) events empty. Sometimes, people might even come for the free food and mingle for three or five minutes, but leave right after that. That leaves no room for actual bonding. Efforts to build a cohesive quad community have been largely ineffective. When a big QuadEx event happens on West Campus, the only (few) people who show up are all from West Campus. The same goes for those on East Campus, with barely any upperclassmen caring enough to go.I don’t blame them. Few is not Southgate. Southgate has about 140 residents, three common spaces and two entrances, making it perfect for community-building. Few, on the other hand, has 430 people spread across maze-like hallways on 13 different floors, nine different entrances and 10 small common rooms. How do you find community in a place like that? You couldn’t fit all residents in our largest common room if you wanted to. There are not even enough beds for all the Southgate and GA sophomores and juniors. Juniors in several dorms, committed to their quads, have been kicked out to Swift due to the lack of space. Upperclassmen are simply not there to pass on “quad traditions” to sophomores. There is little actual interaction between classes — a pillar of QuadEx.From my conversations with friends in other dorms, this is not an isolated experience but rather a staple QuadEx feature for many: large residential buildings devoid of any meaningful community that lead to isolation and loneliness. Wasn't QuadEx supposed to develop the exact opposite? What happened to belonging and inclusivity?Duke will tell you that the residential system before QuadEx was much worse. But was it? In a 2022 Chronicle article, Jackson Prince, Trinity '19, said he realized a need for housing reform because “there were times he felt out of place, like nights he wasn’t invited to members-only Wayne events and found himself alone in an empty Crowell section.” Sounds familiar? Well, this was Duke in 2016, and it is today’s QuadEx Duke as well. In fact, because most Selective Living Groups (SLG) and Greek life are now removed from campus, more social events than ever tend to happen off-campus, leaving those who are not invited alone in their empty Crowell sections.The truth is that Duke has not “moved from a culture of selectivity” as university administrators tend to believe. Greek life still has a powerful presence in social life, and interest in joining it has increased for the first time in years with the Class of 2026. Although we have yet to see if the trend continues this year, it’s worth considering whether people are looking for alternatives to find a community in college. And unlike in Prince’s time, with most Greek groups disaffiliated, Duke has little control over these organizations and their off-campus parties, which can be both inaccessible and a concern for their Durham neighbors.On top of that, many Living and Learning Communities (LLCs) are still selective. The same applies to dozens of campus clubs and organizations. Although bound by the constraints of selectivity, these communities maintain their closeness and tight-knit connections by keeping relatively low membership, which is essential as demonstrated in my earlier comparison of Southgate and Few. If university officials are not fighting them like other selective living groups, then the problem must not be selectivity itself.Nor does it need to be. SLGs have been historically as ethnically, economically and socially diverse as non-selective housing, promoting belonging and inclusivity to many Duke students. I’ve heard more than one story of people who only felt like they belonged at Duke after finding haven in one of these selective communities. Are their experiences and feelings not worth preserving? If Duke can afford to have other selective living and non-living groups, Student Affairs should consider reforming its residential program to protect and house communities that have consistently given the sense of home they are mostly failing to offer through QuadEx. Duke’s response to these arguments will be the same as it has been since QuadEx’s announcement in Fall 2021. They seem convinced that this is a process that will take time. That if they heavily invest in telling students their quad communities matter (with events like Bricks to Stone and Quad Cup), those quad communities eventually will. They certainly succeeded at that in 1996 when President Nan Keohane made East Campus an all-freshmen campus, generating immense student backlash then regarding what is currently one of the most celebrated residential reforms in Duke’s history. College administrators might think the same will happen to QuadEx. President Keohane, however, reaped early positive results two years after her reform. Two years into QuadEx implementation and we are worse than where we started, with nearly zero residential excitement on this campus. The dorms are too big. There aren’t enough beds for everyone. Nights are eerily quiet with no parties in sight. These residences have never looked so lifeless. Unlike schools like Yale, UChicago and Harvard, Duke’s West Campus was not built to support residential colleges. It’s time for Duke to accept this.Duke’s residential system has been a topic of contention for years. Every decade, there’s a different housing reform, only for some people to continue to be left outside of the social scene. It has never been perfect. It needed adjustments. Although I believe there are positive aspects in QuadEx — like Experiential Orientation and more certainty about housing for sophomores — I’m afraid its attempt to solve the pains of residential life might have made them worse. It has not eliminated selectivity at Duke. It is driving social life further away from campus and targeting active, inclusive communities in the process. It is failing students, like me, who are losing their freshmen dorm communities despite the promise that wouldn’t happen. How many more students does QuadEx have to fail before our leadership realizes the need for its urgent, immediate reform?Gabriel Reis is a Trinity sophomore."
"At Duke, we serve ourselves",Advikaa Anand,2024-01-18T05:00:00Z,Jan,18,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/011824-anand-we-serve-ourselves-20240118.html,"It was the day of my first final of last semester, and a cold spell had settled over Duke. I sat in Cafe, sipping on masala chai to restore some semblance of warmth to my veins and to distract myself from the test anxiety quivering in my chest. As I focused on my breathing, a middle-aged man with black baggy pants and white stains on his brown shirt slid into my view.But what caught my eye were the two hospital bracelets encircling each of his wrists. A shiver crept down my spine. Was he okay? Did he need help?Shaking off my uneasiness, I was getting ready to head to the library when two armed police officers entered Cafe. All eyes were glued to the scene as they gripped the man from each side, escorting him off the premises. This incident has been seared into my brain. I’m not quite sure why, but I reckon it has something to do with the behavior of other patrons in Cafe that day. While I may have also misinterpreted the situation, it seemed to me that their body language, such as the side glances, sent a clear message: This man did not belong here. And what was even more disturbing was that it’s not uncommon for non-Duke-affiliated patrons to be spotted in WU. But this man, whose lower socioeconomic status slotted him in a narrow minority on this campus, was not welcome. I'd heard of the “Duke bubble” before, but that day marked the first time it jumped out at me so clearly — this tangible boundary between those who call Duke home and those who call Durham home. The critique of this division is omnipresent in Duke student circles. We commonly fault the location of Duke’s main campus in the middle of a forest, with its stately Gothic architecture far removed from the modest bricks and quiet cobblestones that characterize downtown Durham. As much as this separation is engendered by the architectural nuances of Duke’s campus and the socioeconomic divisions between a university whose endowment is approximately $11.6 billion and a city where 13.2% of the population lives below the poverty line, it is also perpetuated by the actions and decisions of many Duke students, whose academic and professional choices steer them away from the general population comprising Durham and into social circles oozing with generational wealth and professions promising six-figure salaries. Mandating service work as a graduation requirement would help diffuse the concentrated tensions around career building and professionalism to a useful cause, skillfully deploying Duke students’ talents in arenas where they can do good. Besides eroding the Duke bubble, this service work would offer students a whole set of other benefits, including combatting predispositions to depression, developing social and relationship skills and cultivating general life satisfaction. Prestigious schools such as Duke University pride themselves on creating change makers — here, we engineer the leaders of tomorrow. Our students are supposed to use the privilege of their education to enrich the lives of those around them. And most of our students do arrive on this campus with virtuous dreams of making a difference (just think about what you wrote in your college application essays). But soon the lofty price tag with which this education begins to weigh on us, and we veer away from our passions of altruism into careers with the promise of financial security. Thus, we devote ourselves to the pursuit of tomorrow. We devise solutions for all the issues that we see arising in the future on the macroscopic level, as our class discussions center around topics such as issues of AI domination and destructive nuclear war. But what about those people, like the man in Cafe, whose suffering is palpable in the here and now? Are we, collectively, doing enough to ease their burdens?Now, there are initiatives at Duke in service of this mission, such as classes with mandatory service learning components, programs organized by the Duke Partnership for Service, and fully funded nonprofit internship experiences through Duke Engage. However, almost all of these programs are opt-in. As a result, the students who are able to use their education in service of others are mostly those with prior inclinations towards service work. A mandatory service learning requirement for graduation would allow students from all academic backgrounds to reap the benefits of service work. I have learned so much since coming to Duke, and my mind has developed in ways I couldn’t fathom. I have availed the vast benefits of a liberal arts education through my study of the plight of maternal healthcare during WWI, the evolutionary connections between life in the sea and mankind, and the emergence of prices from the intersection of supply and demand. But stored within me, this knowledge is futile. For my education to be worth its while, I must use my academic lessons to catalyze the betterment of those around me. Equally important are those who breathe life into the abstract concepts stored in my brain — those women who suffer the real-world consequences of the anti-abortion policies that I write memos about, those children in marginalized communities whose development I read papers about and those local people whose human rights abuses I lead discussions about.Ultimately, they can teach me far more than writing a paper with a word limit of 1500.

Olive Garden as a metaphor for life,Nathan Luzum,2024-01-17T05:00:00Z,Jan,17,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/011724-luzum-olive-garden-20240117.html,"I really love Olive Garden. It’s where I’ve celebrated my birthday for many years, where my parents and I stop on vacation for a nice meal, where my family dined the night before I left for college — the list goes on, but many important moments in my life have been commemorated in the company of free breadsticks. Sure, in recent years, I’ve gained more of an appreciation for trying local food and expanding my palate, but there’s just something so heartwarming about the predictability of a chain — especially one that showers you with freebies.It was with this in mind that a group of friends and I arrived at the Brier Creek Olive Garden at around 5:30 p.m. one evening at the end of November, which was the last weekend of their “Never Ending Pasta Bowl” promotion. We were met with the wistful hum of planes taking off from RDU in the background, the shouts of children as they raced to the door and excitement in the air. One could almost imagine we were in a bustling Italian market if not for the Hobby Lobby across the parking lot. Unfortunately, there was a 45-minute wait (the Venn diagram of people who like Olive Garden and people who eat dinner before 6 p.m. borders on a perfect circle), but the delay only intensified my longing for pasta. Once seated, we were eagerly greeted by our waiter Sirus, who would certainly earn his keep by responding to our incessant requests for more food throughout the rest of the evening. As we scanned the menus in front of us, my eyes were drawn to the special card on the table devoted to the reason for the season: the Never Ending Pasta Bowl. This, like most entrees at Olive Garden, comes with free breadsticks and either a free salad or a free soup. But here’s the catch: If everybody orders the free salad, a big, communal one is just placed in the middle of the table — the same size that would be served even if only one or two people ordered it. Thus, most of us made the wise and calculated decision to order free soup, while someone took one for the team and ordered a free salad with the promise of a spoonful or two of soup getting slipped their way. Perhaps it’s sad to be in your mid-20s and have a well-honed strategy for getting your money’s worth out of a chain restaurant, but I choose to think of it as one of my charming qualities. Soon the free soups, salads and breadsticks started to flow. The first order of breadsticks quickly disappeared. We asked for more. Our waiter said that there was a backlog but that he would fight to get the next batch for our table. I have no clue whether any of that was true or if it was just a ploy to increase our tip, but either way, it worked. Like royalty, we feasted on the continuous assemblage of carbohydrates brought before us, dishes replaced as soon as they were whisked away. The feeling of fullness started to set in before long, but at Olive Garden, satiety must be brushed aside. After all, it was now time for the main course: the Never Ending Pasta Bowl. The phrase seems silly to capitalize at first, but after consumption, it becomes clear that every single capital letter is well deserved.Many of us struggled to get through the first plate of pasta, and I barely managed to advance to the second. Face-to-face with yet another pasta bowl, even if somewhat smaller than the first, I had to call it quits. Fortunately, we were able to take the rest of our pasta and breadsticks (along with a box of free tasty mints) to go, but I was racked with what-ifs. What if I’d had one fewer breadstick? A less hefty tong-full of salad? Fewer slurps of soup? Maybe I would’ve been able to enjoy more never-ending pasta if I had just planned and calculated better. But, as everything in life is wont to do, the Never Ending Pasta Bowl eventually came to an end.In an effort to extract some sort of lesson from Olive Garden, I’d like to point out a few commonalities between my Never Ending Pasta Bowl experience and life. We can spend our time in so many ways, but are ultimately constrained by the finite hours in our day. Just as we can’t have endless soup, salad, breadsticks and pasta in one sitting, we can’t cram a lengthy essay, dinner, a movie with friends, errands and everything else we might like to do into a single day.Life constantly pushes us to re-evaluate our priorities — and they don’t always have to be the same from day to day. One Olive Garden trip could be a pasta occasion where you show impressive restraint with all the free appetizers to save room to indulge in several bowls of pasta. The next trip could be the time to eat all the soup and breadsticks you want, just to take most of your pasta entrée home. Likewise, life is all about a tasteful blend of activities, with some days more focused on work, others dedicated to fun and most somewhere in between. If the person next to you is going ham on the soup while you’re waiting for the pasta, there’s a chance you’ll question if you have your priorities straight. But I’ve realized that sometimes people are just hungrier for soup in the moment, and at the end of the day, it all evens out in life.Nathan Luzum is a third-year medical student and a member of the DSPC Board of Directors.

Books will set you free,Carol Apollonio,2024-01-17T05:00:00Z,Jan,17,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/011724-apollonio-skeptical-books-20240117.html,"“I’m very skeptical of books. I don’t want to say no book is ever worth reading, but I actually do believe something pretty close to that...I think, if you wrote a book, you f—ed up, and it should have been a six-paragraph blog post.” — Sam Bankman-Fried (skeptical of books).It’s certainly true that reading books can slow you down. Even the non-fiction ones have a fuzzy aspect to them. I’m guessing, though, that the real target here is fiction. Why on earth would you waste time reading stuff that is made up? Will reading stories get you a job someday? Help you create a cure for a terrible disease? Bring world peace?OK, all right, the answer is no.Not all that long ago, colleges used to advertise themselves with photos of attractive, well-groomed students sprawled on sunlit quads reading books. Now google around and you’ll find the exact same photos, only with some fashion updates and with laptops photoshopped in for the books. Go into the library and they (sorry you) are all in there hunched over laptops. No one is reading a book. A couple of years ago I had a student who wasn’t interested in reading actual book-books. I bribed her: I told her I’d give her a 100 on a daily quiz if she would bring a book from Perkins Library, any book whatsoever, to class the next day. She did not, and would not, not then or the next week either or ever.There was a young person in my life not so long ago. First time he saw my bookshelves he locked eyes on Victor Hugo’s ""Les Misérables."" The book is massive. Between you and me, there’s an entire world packed into that book, and I’ve spent many happy hours in there. Anyway, this young guest of mine looked at it with such longing that I gave it to him to keep.“You’re going to love it!” I said.“Oh,” he replied, “I’m going to cut out the insides and make it into a secret storage box.” Reminded me of when Restoration Hardware was selling book-like boxes with beige covers for interior décor that you could buy and stack up artfully in your home. No pages inside. They cost more than real books! Now when I see shelves lined with books I always wonder if there’s anything inside them instead of words — jewelry, maybe, Treasury bonds, small firearms, bundles of cash, crypto codes or even, as fictional Russian con-man Ostap Bender would say, “the key to the apartment where all the money is” (here is the phrase in Russian).One time I worked as an interpreter for a group of Russian furniture makers who were attending the High Point Furniture Fair (look it up guys, it’s in your neighborhood). Showroom after showroom after showroom. All they could ask was, “Where are the bookcases?” The answer? Not in High Point. Disclaimer: I am not fetishizing physical books. I get it that people read e-books, and I do too. I even force my students to read e-texts on Canvas! It doesn’t matter; I’m pretty sure that Sam Bankman-Fried wasn’t talking about physical books. He was talking about reading anything that was not some kind of crypto-instruction manual, or, say, a six-paragraph blog post about how to make money out of air and lies. So now go read Dostoevsky’s ""Notes from the Dead House,"" a fictionalized memoir of four years the writer spent in what he called “enforced communal living” (Siberian hard-labor prison). The Russian for that phrase, for the curious, is related to the Russian word for dormitory, so some aspects of his experience might have been like yours in Duke dorms. Or, as my Russian lit bros will suggest, like the human condition itself: entrapment, against our will, in a fallen, sinful world.One day I had to send a stack of Dostoevsky magnets to a colleague in Chicago. (Yes, that is correct, Dostoevsky magnets. I made them.) I went to the UPS on Ninth St., and the guy behind the counter said, “Wow, for such a small box, this sure is heavy. What’s in there?”, and naturally I said, “Dostoevsky magnets.” And he goes, “Really? That’s so cool! There was a time when I did nothing but read Dostoevsky books and talk about them with my friends.” Excited, I asked, “When was that?”, and he said, “When I was locked up in prison. There wasn’t much else for us to do.”OK, I’m almost done.The best way to get inside someone else’s head is to read a good work of fiction. Naturally, given that we’re limited to cold facts here, I’m not able to get inside the head of a felon who stole billions of dollars (uh, cryptocurrency) from trustful investors and used it to buy fancy stuff, including politicians, claiming that it was all for some imaginary future charitable enterprise. I am kind of thinking that bitcoins themselves are a cheap form of fiction, but considerably less interesting than a random short story by a mildly talented writer.I’m hoping that someone will write this story.All that aside, it seems clear that at least one non-reading crook will spend the rest of his life behind bars. Just idly I’m wondering if, like so many others in a state of non-freedom, he might plunge into such despair that he might crack open a book. A real one.Reading fiction might not earn you a lot of money, Sam. But it will set you free.Professor Carol Apollonio has been teaching Russian literature at Duke for 40 years, and this is her final semester.

Letter from alumni: A response to Duke Students Supporting Israel,"Mark Pinsky, Jeffrey Gold, Douglas Schocken",2024-01-16T05:00:00Z,Jan,16,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/011624-gold-pinsky-schocken-letter-20240116.html,"We, concerned Duke alumni who are Jewish, are responding to Duke Students Supporting Israel’s Dec. 7 guest column. We share their abhorrence toward the October Hamas attack on Israel and with antisemitism in general, but we respectfully wish to offer some other valid interpretations of certain circumstances. We hope our guest column can enhance this important conversation — both within the Jewish community and externally. Ongoing civil discourse regarding current Israel-Palestine events is crucial and has become increasingly fraught. We try here to identify areas of disagreement with the student organization’s statement, placing these disagreements within an inclusive historical and contemporary context.Context: Multiple conflicting narrativesThis context considers and incorporates multiple conflicting narratives regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict. These narratives typically center around three separate but interacting themes: tribalism, historical trauma and victimhood, as put in Raja G. Khouri and Jeffrey J. Wilkinson’s The Wall Between: What Jews and Palestinians Don’t Want to Know About Each Other. We suggest that the current students’ statement fails to consider these often tragic, conflicting narratives as legitimate truths. That perspective can reinforce a binary “us vs. them” paradigm, which can become mere self-justification. Rather, we desperately need to struggle — perhaps very uncomfortably at times — against these dichotomies that imply we are right and you are wrong.Cases in point: SSI’s statement mentions several antisemitic acts, domestic and international, evidencing rising antisemitism. However, they appear premature in one of their examples. Detroit law enforcement has not connected the man arrested in synagogue leader Samantha Woll’s stabbing death with antisemitism.Antisemitism, like any ethnic and/or religious hatred, is inherently repulsive, but SSI’s statement fails to mention the Chicago suburbs murder of a six-year-old Muslim boy or the recent near-fatal attack against three Palestinian students in Vermont as well as other Islamophobic acts. Why exclude these equally detestable acts of hatred, when they are part of the same relational fabric?Similarly, the ancestral claim to the land of Israel is only one people’s claim. Historically and biblically, it was never “a land without a people.” It was, in fact, “peopled” — by different tribes before and then alongside the Israelites. Those tribes and kingdoms rose and fell, as did the Jews’. No exclusive — or superior — divine or historical claim on the land exists. To assert this claim for Jews is to engage in Jewish supremacy, which is extremely problematic. Yes, the chant “from the river to the sea” now evokes for Jews further trauma and revives deeply troubling Holocaust memories. Yet the Duke students’ statement excludes similar declarations by Jews — from the Likud party platform to West Bank settler-extremists’ religious fanaticism and violence.We Jews are not the only ones experiencing existential threat.Apartheid?Regarding apartheid, much debate exists — but when the major Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem issues a detailed account outlining apartheid, we should carefully and critically listen, rather than stridently and reflexively reject it. Even Israeli security experts agree. On Sept. 6, a month before Hamas attacked, former Mossad head Tamir Pardo acknowledged that Israel enforces apartheid in the West Bank.Furthermore, a Jewish state that defines its citizenship’s privileges based solely on ethno-religious membership would have to engage in some form of apartheid for those members not meeting the citizenship requirements. We would argue Israel’s imperfect democracy (with its recently demonstrated fractures) is not extended to the Occupied Territories, which include the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israel controls the former through the Palestinian Authority. This control has imposed a system of walls, roadblocks and checkpoints, differential ID cards and differential infrastructure. Nathan Thrall’s 2021 essay “A Day in the Life of Abed Salama” offers a compelling and in-depth analysis of the differential treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and the tragedy it entails.We don’t advocate for either a “one-state” or “two-state” solution. But given the demographics of the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, a one-state solution with full democratic rights for all would ultimately doom any notion of an identifiably Jewish State of Israel.The central issue is that Zionism — the ideology that eventually led to post-Holocaust Jewish self-determination and the state of Israel as a safe haven for all Jews — underscores all these aforementioned themes. Zionism emerged during the age of European colonialism and imperialism. Zionism and Arab nationalism gave rise to Jews’ and Palestinians’ conflicting aspirations for a nation each could call their own. Zionism is thus in large part a product of its history, inextricably bound to the dispossession and displacement of another people.Scholar Sara Roy, a child of Holocaust survivors, articulated this issue eloquently when she wrote: “But in the post-Holocaust world, Jewish memory has failed in one critical respect: It has excluded the reality of Palestinian suffering and Jewish culpability therein. As a people, we have been unable to link the creation of Israel with the displacement of the Palestinians. We have been unwilling to see, let alone remember, that finding our place meant the loss of theirs.”Two conflicting views of the Israeli War of Independence and what Palestinians call the Nakba (meaning “catastrophe”) interpret the same historical events from very different perspectives. Our effort to recognize these events’ complexity is an effort to humanize the “Other.” If we do not struggle with this reality, we condemn ourselves to either continually reinforcing our victimhood or attempting the ongoing manifestation of military omnipotence and its corollary, dehumanization.Anti-Zionism is antisemitism?Insisting that anti-Zionism is categorically antisemitism is a profound injustice to the interwoven Israel-Palestine narratives. Palestinian nationalists are not all Hamas members. Anti-Zionism may or may not be antisemitic. Political Zionism has been aligned and practically synonymous with Jewish statehood. Zionism’s history, however, is multifaceted and includes those who initially argued against statehood: Judah Magnes, Martin Buber, a majority of the American Reform movement, and so on. Were they all antisemitic? Anti-Zionist? To complicate matters further, some Jewish ultra-Orthodox groups both in Israel and elsewhere are anti-Zionist, including Neturei Karta. (Some, like Agudath Israel, which opposed Zionism in the past are now part of the Israeli coalition.)One could also assert that the argument for a Palestinian confederation or a bi-national state is anti-Zionist. It is hardly antisemitic.Our point? We fear that the “Anti-Zionism is antisemitism” slogan serves a very different purpose: weaponizing antisemitism to undermine criticism of Israel and what we believe is a much more compelling perspective on Israel-Palestine.What now?We do not dispute the Oct. 7 events were horrific, in particular the unimaginable crimes against Israeli women. Most of us have one or two degrees of separation from either having family or knowing someone who suffered from Hamas’ barbarism. While there is no love lost by most Israeli Jews for the Netanyahu government, the military response in Gaza has also been barbaric — with reports now of around 23,000 Palestinians killed at the time of this writing, most of them young adults or children, medical care collapsing and up to 85% of the population uprooted, displaced and homeless. Is this grossly asymmetrical death toll evidence of Israel defending itself? We are reminded of the U.S. military in Vietnam: “Destroying a village in order to save it” became a slogan identifying U.S. military strategy. How much is enough?In light of our view that there is no military solution to the Israel-Gaza War, we understand the calls for an immediate cease-fire. What is needed, however, is a fundamentally different discourse — one that recognizes the multiple conflicting truths and complexities that inextricably bind us as Israeli and Diaspora Jews and Palestinians, one which accounts for Israeli and Palestinian power differentials and which does not engage in arguments about moral equivalence and “what-aboutism.”Organizations like Standing Together and Parent Circle-Families Forum both comprising Israeli Jews and Palestinians, offer an alternative to end the madness and violence. They insist on affirming others’ humanity, sharing values of peace, equality and co-existence. They have the moral courage to share their own — and listen deeply to others' — history of pain, trauma and existential fear and to acknowledge the shared yearning for freedom and safety. They are committed to this very hard work. They believe that is how to begin to build trust and that lasting peaceful solutions can only emerge from the foundation of earned trust. That is where we should direct our hope and energies.Signed on behalf of concerned alumni at Duke University,Jeffrey Gold, ‘72, Mark I.

In memory of Martin Luther King Jr.: The wise caution of amos (especially to religious folk),Luke A. Powery,2024-01-15T05:00:00Z,Jan,15,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/011524-powery-martin-luther-king-jr-memory-20240115.html,"In his famous “I Have a Dream” speech, Martin Luther King Jr. quoted the prophet Amos, saying, “Justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.” King returned to these words repeatedly in his speeches and sermons; they were a kind of theological and linguistic motif for his ministry. As we once again consider King’s legacy, it is helpful to examine the larger literary context of this oft-quoted scripture verse from chapter five of the Book of Amos, in which the prophet is relaying a divine message that no ceremony or song can make up for injustice in a community.The first thing to know about this scripture passage is that it is not light bedtime reading. It is a serious message just like King’s. In his judgment oracle, Amos is cautioning leaders in an unjust society who want God to come and take charge of things. We learn from Amos that this coming “day of the Lord” might not be what these leaders expect because it is “darkness, not light; as if someone fled from a lion, and was met by a bear; or went into the house and rested a hand against the wall, and was bitten by a snake.”Amos goes on to explain why God would be so severe with them. To these leaders who “trample on the poor” and “push aside the needy in the gate,” Amos has this message about their hypocrisy: “I hate, I despise your festivals, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies. Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them; and the offerings of well-being of your fatted animals I will not look upon. Take away from me the noise of your songs; I will not listen to the melody of your harps.” The key elements of their worship — the festivals, the sacrifices and the melodic praise — disgust God. This is a shocking word, and in particular to religious people, because it reveals that the people of God can become enemies of God.This reminds me of what Dr. King once said in his sermon ""The Three Dimensions of a Complete Life"": There are people who may profess God with their lips but “deny God’s existence with their lives.” Like Amos, he is pointing to a potential danger of piety, spiritual practice or liturgical rites. Sometimes, the very practices established to draw one close to God create a distance from God. Rites don’t make one righteous but rather can be ruinous.Finally, for Amos, righteousness and justice are both related to the social order, and especially to the protection of the weak and poor. How a people lives as a community of God in the world should be linked to their worship of God. And so, Amos’ condemnation of unacceptable religious rituals is immediately followed by those famous words: “Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.” King embraced this message of Amos and worked on behalf of the poor and the oppressed.The wisdom of Amos — especially for religious practitioners — offers a challenge to integrate one’s lip service and life service. We can sing folk songs all we want, but in the end, are we helping the folk? Are we working toward justice and righteousness in the marketplace of life — in homeless shelters and food pantries and court rooms and prisons and addiction recovery centers? On this MLK day, this is what should roll down and flow like streams from our lives.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel. His column runs on alternate Mondays."
The road to Wagner,Angikar Ghosal,2024-01-15T05:00:00Z,Jan,15,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/031524-ghosal-road-to-wagner-20240115.html,"I have noticed that many students in top American schools were inclined towards the cultivation of music during their formative high school years — music was one of their essential extracurricular activities. I trained in vocal Indian classical music for years, but I lack the repertoire of any musical instrument, and I can't expeditiously read sheet music. I hold in esteem the mettle and proficiency exhibited by the adroit viola players, and I extend my unfeigned admiration to all the pianists and trumpet players at Duke. It is undeniably commendable how adeptly the United States' K-12 education system has assimilated musical pedagogy. However, my lamentation lies in the discernible extent to which classical music finds itself peculiarly compartmentalized. A considerable cohort of practitioners perceives classical music as an exclusive province of professional obligations, starkly divorced from its potential integration into the sphere of personal temporality, leisure pursuits and moments of repose. This observation, while not a sweeping generalization, is underscored by the conspicuous predilection of people who are virtuosic violinists yet prefer Billie Eilish over Rachmaninoff. Classical music is too often banished from the realm of individualized gratification. Individuals who do not have formal choral or quartet affiliations yet conscientiously, regularly listen to classical music remain an even rarer occurrence. Hence, connoisseurs of classical music are relegated to specialists or older generations. Paradoxically, the absence of a formal education in Western classical music has made me ardently appreciate the art form. In high school, I listened to a considerable corpus of classical compositions, with an inclination toward Shostakovich and Tchaikovsky. However, it was not until my undergraduate years that I became a full aficionado.I traversed through the ‘Sturm und Drang’ Mozart's Symphony No. 25, the opulence of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, and other orchestral masterpieces. Yet, it was in opera that I discovered the peak of my musical passion. Indeed, part of this is because of my training in vocal Indian classical music, hence a lot of rules and best practices regarding vocal enunciation carried over. I had my own indigenous lexicon, which I later realized meant the same as Western terms such as staccatos and vibratos. I discovered solace in the resoundingly articulate intonation prevalent in operatic renditions, a stark departure from the prevailing sotto voce breathy timbre ubiquitous in contemporary female popular music. The traversal through the musical repertoire culminated in the identification of my favored opera composer — Richard Wagner. I maintain that were Richard Wagner alive in the 21st century, he would have deserved over Bob Dylan to be the first music composer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. While I readily acknowledge Mozart's comprehensive aptitude in musical composition and Puccini's composition of the most unforgettable arias, I do not believe Mozart ever ascended to the literary eminence achieved by Wagner. “Cosi fan tutte"" was a pinnacle of vulgarity because of its portrayal of women, and even as someone who appreciates that Puccini is a staple of the New York Metropolitan Opera, Puccini cannot be absolved of unabashed sentimentalism. It is Wagner who, in my estimation, represents the apotheosis of musical expression. Upon revisiting the academic treatises on Wagner, the musical theory unfolded as intuitive, already-discovered deductions. I realized that an acutely discerning auditory faculty, even when not equipped with pre-existing annotations, bestows an innate cognizance of the salient facets embedded within the composition. Well in advance of my understanding of terms such as 'poco ritenuto' or the intricacies of chromaticism, I had organically formulated my own lexicon for my exclusive enlightenment, predicated upon empirical observations. The nomenclature found in Western musical textbooks emerged as a way more refined, sophisticated, and meticulously conceptualized iteration of the cognitive framework I had independently constructed. I have long considered the capacity to fervently sob to the prelude of ‘Tannhäuser’ as an indicator of virtuous moral character. This is particularly discernible in the stark dichotomy between the Repentance motif and the Bacchanal motif. Wagner's ‘Der Ring des Nibelungen’ has imparted to me more profound insights into the societal implications of technology than the works of Heidegger and Marcuse combined. Consider ‘Das Rheingold’, are silicon chips not the modern Rhinegold? Whoever forges the Rhinegold into a ring gains power over the world, but renounces love - do the electronic and computer industry not embody the same principles? 'Parsifal' has furnished me with a deeper comprehension of human sexuality and masculinity than any discourse by Foucault. Why is the modern quest for the Holy Spear and not the Holy Grail? Long before the advent of smartphones and ChatGPT, Wagner meditated on the inextricable tethering of our human essence to machineries and tools – without the Rhinegold or the Tarnknappe invisibility cloak, many of his characters would lead markedly benign existences, would they not? One of my favorite classes at Duke was in film theory — due to which I delved into the connections from Wagner to Mahler to Holst and then to Bernard Herrmann to John Williams to Hans Zimmer in the cinematic domain. Is the cinematic realm, with its amalgamation of visual and auditory elements, not the quintessential Gesamtkunstwerk, a synthesis into a transcendent whole? Are baritone horns the instrument of danger or is danger the emotion from baritone horns? ‘Tannhäuser’, my favorite Wagnerian opera, is one of those rare artistic creations susceptible to diametrically opposing interpretations, with espousals of utterly antithetical moral implications - one can debate if Wagner is pronouncing a triumph of Christian over pagan ethics or advocating the subversion of traditional morality through free-spirited paganism. Personally, I incline toward the former explanation, the conviction that Wagner espouses the ascendancy of the sacred realm over its profane counterpart - making the character of Princess Elisabeth as poignant as the life story of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary. Nevertheless, one cannot ignore the symbolic emergence of shoots from the pope’s staff, thereby affording an alternative perspective, advocating for unrestrained affection and the cultivation of an idyllic ethos as the innate condition of humankind. Is this not romantic irony? The most intense junctures within Wagner's works are their own spiritual odysseys. Undoubtedly, the sacred realm has always had a pivotal role in classical music. Reflect upon the denouement of ‘Parsifal’, wherein the confluence of the Holy Spear and the Holy Grail occurs with the chorus of “Redemption to the Redeemer''! Reflect upon the conclusion to ‘Tannhäuser’, where the pronouncement “Salvation is granted to the penitent by grace; he now enters into blessed peace!” resounds, with an interplay of the Pilgrim and the Pulse of Life leitmotifs.

When we are betrayed: Who to be and what to do?,"Allegra Jordan, Theodore Ryan",2023-12-18T05:00:00Z,Dec,18,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/121823-jordan-ryan-elko-betrayal-20231218.html,"Our community welcomes our new Duke football head coach Manny Diaz. We can be happy for our new future. We must also honor that we have invisible, moral injuries from how former Duke Football Coach Mike Elko left us. Unfortunately, moral injuries linger. At Duke, we have the moral imagination to heal these injuries in a healthy way.Leaders can resign. Fleeing under the cover of darkness is the problem.“But, sports is a business,” some say. Tell that to the human heart. Betrayal is bad business. It’s costly. No good business leader flees under the cover of darkness. “Midnight Mike” Elko was a trusted authority figure. He asked for sacrifices by his players on behalf of the football program, based on the value of mutual commitment that goes beyond mere self-interest. When we are committed to each other, we say goodbye properly. How did Coach Elko leave? Monday, Nov. 27, before our class started, we saw a video of Elko landing in College Station, Texas around 3 a.m. He descended from the steps of a private jet. We saw a clip of him dancing with his new administrators. He scheduled a 10 a.m. call with the Duke football team to inform them about his decision. The Zoom meeting lasted less than four minutes. This semester we taught a core leadership course at Duke’s Pratt School of Engineering to more than 150 graduate engineers. One of us — professor Allegra Jordan — encountered a student of ours on the way to class. He had a cough from the cold air at the Pitt football game, doing work for the program. This student took great pride in being at Duke, not just for its academic excellence but also because he bought into Duke as a caring and ethical community. He beamed speaking about the win and his role in helping the team. He didn't know Coach Elko fled before dawn. The color drained from his face as he heard the news. He stuttered in disbelief. “Why didn’t he tell us?”One leader may wound, but a community of leaders can help heal. We offer three reflections. These can help you with this community betrayal, and when you are personally betrayed:Ask, ""What happened to me?"", not, ""What did I do wrong?"" Hold yourself in warm regard as you reflect on what happened. Affirm that others act out of their own character, not because of who you are. You deserve better than what your betrayer did to you.Ask, ""Will I let Mike Elko's violating his promises veto me?"" Will we let how Elko acted keep us from having high standards for ourselves and others? Will what Elko did diminish or strengthen our commitment to act with integrity and care?Regardless of what Elko did, ask, ""Who am I committed to becoming?"" If you’re not sure of your answer, consider the idea Aristotle gave Western Civilization: You are here to flourish. Flourishing for Aristotle meant achieving “arete,” a holistic concept that calls us to be our best self, to live virtuously, to develop and use all of our powers and, as a by-product, attain genuine happiness. With that magnificent vision in mind, will you let the actions of a self-centered football coach rob you of who you can be? ""How do I handle the bitter times when a person who said they'd care for me abandons me?"" The question of how we deal with ""joy snatched away"" is a vital life skill. We hope these suggestions help you flourish in the face of the irreversible, and, at times, unbearable, betrayals in life.Allegra Jordan and Theodore Ryan, Ph.D., are adjunct professors at the Pratt School of Engineering.Editor's Note: Information about the Zoom call between players and former head football head coach Mike Elko was independently verified by The Chronicle with a source who had direct knowledge of the call.

Letter to Duke football players: Don't ever give up,Richard Byrd,2023-12-12T05:00:00Z,Dec,12,Letters To The Editor,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101223-byrd-duke-football-letter-20231212.html,"Dear Blue Devil football players,As a long-time fan, I would first like to express my gratitude for your commitment to Duke, your hard work and sacrifices and the success you have attained on the field. I also wish success for all of you in your future endeavors. And I understand the institution of college athletics, for better or worse, is dramatically different from what it was for most of my life.Second, if I may say more about my gratitude for your efforts, you have made a huge difference in my health status during the past two seasons as I fight a battle with prostate cancer. It is difficult to describe the good feeling I experienced in the stands watching the season finale against Pitt. Your efforts on and off the field impact the lives of so many of us in ways you can't imagine.Third, I can't imagine how difficult it must be for those of you who are facing the prospect of a third coaching staff in your time at Duke and are being asked to trust another group of coaches. I taught and coached for 30 years so I understand the bond that should exist between athletes and coaches but all too often does not.Lastly, I certainly don't know any of you well enough to suggest that I know what's best for you personally, academically or athletically. However, I want you to know that you have made a difference in my life. I am headed to Birmingham to support you. I understand change is inevitable; however, I hope you will consider your commitment to your teammates and finish the job you started at Duke.Best wishes and happy holidays to you all. And Let's Go, Duke! Beat Troy!Richard Byrd is a lifelong Duke sports fan from South Carolina."
"'We've heard enough': The Chronicle to end 'Student Voices' columns, Monday Monday reports",Monday Monday,2023-12-11T05:00:00Z,Dec,11,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/121123-monday-monday-ending-student-voices-20231211.html,"No more opinion columns. In a unanimous vote of everyone here at The Chronicle (according to the count of Monday Monday), editors and columnists alike have decided that the collective Duke community has heard every single opinion, and there are no more left to share. “The Chronicle has been around since 1905. Nothing you can come up with can possibly be as funny or interesting as anything we’ve published in the last 100 years. Don’t believe us? Go on, check the archives. We can wait,” read an exclusive statement from The Chronicle's editors obtained by Monday Monday. All the opinions have been exhausted. QuadEx is good, QuadEx is bad. Duke is too elite. New York is overrated. Top social scientists at Duke agree: We have run out of things to talk about. Ever wonder why The Chronicle rarely prints these days? It’s because ink is expensive, and we can’t afford to keep printing things that everyone already knows. “In this time of political strife, we should be in solidarity with one another. Let’s save our disagreements for the things that actually matter, like Nicki Minaj’s new album and thoughts about the newest Hunger Games movie,” The Chronicle’s memo read. Instead of wasting time on opinion pieces, The Chronicle will now focus on covering what’s important: basketball games, tennis games and more basketball games. In place of the student voices section, The Chronicle will be quadrupling the amount of crosswords. Campus celebrities everywhere are frustrated by the news. “This is unbelievable!!” wrote junior Emily Mu in a Class of 2025 GroupMe post that received five likes. Duke students have lived their whole lives being told they are smarter and more interesting than the average person. Opinion columnists dare to challenge this and say: “Untrue! Our opinions are just as boring as everyone else’s.” The ban, of course, does not apply to the ever-witty, ever-original Monday Monday, because someone has to keep quality satire alive on this campus. Monday Monday thanks their five loyal fans for their support this semester. Their shrewd takes will return for more satirical shenanigans in the coming Centennial."
A defense of the foreign language requirement,Henry Pickford,2023-12-11T05:00:00Z,Dec,11,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101123-pickford-foreign-language-requirement-20231211.html,"The Oct. 27 guest column “Time to Drop the Foreign Language Requirement” tenders five arguments against the foreign language requirement. I think the arguments are rather weak and, more importantly, shortchange the significance of the humanities and a liberal arts education more generally. Although many Duke students are already multilingual or have been placed into more advanced foreign language courses, the column’s arguments seem to presume a monolingual English-speaking student with no foreign language experience, so let’s review the arguments in that context.The first argument assumes, but does not explicitly state, a premise, namely that spending three courses on a foreign language is a waste of time, which is what needs to be demonstrated; the argument is circular.The second argument – that three semesters of foreign language won’t bring fluency, so should not be undertaken – likewise tacitly presupposes that one should study a foreign language only if one thereby achieves fluency. But fluency is a matter of degree, as the column implies by including the term “minimal fluency.” Of course, studying abroad will improve abilities and increase one’s level of fluency more quickly. Duke’s foreign language departments have several means to incorporate study abroad even at the intro level and to facilitate combining study abroad with courses satisfying a student’s non-foreign language major. The third argument claims that if the goal is to learn a language, one can do it elsewhere than at Duke at less time and expense. Presumably, the column’s author means instruction through MOOCs, community colleges, downloadable apps and so on. He provides no evidence that these methods teach languages as well or better than in-class instruction that no doubt will soon be supplemented with — not replaced by — personalized language chatbots, automated homework correction and explication programs and other technologies. Duke’s introductory foreign language courses typically have four contact hours per week in addition to homework and cultural activities, and those classes are comprised of small groups in which students are actively learning in real-time with their peers, not passively attending large lectures or online videos or clicking app buttons in isolation. Moreover, what those other sites and modes of education typically do not provide is study abroad, cultural activities (conversation hours, films, lectures, etc.), accompanying internships in countries with the foreign language, a well-prepared path to upper-level seminars, individual research, honors thesis, and so on. Just like other intro-level courses at Duke, foreign language courses open exciting avenues of learning and growth. Furthermore, if the column’s claim were true, what classes at Duke can one not learn more cheaply and quickly elsewhere? What intro-level Duke courses should a student still take? Isn’t it the case that classes like intro physics, intro chemistry, intro biology, first-semester calculus, intro economics and intro psychology could all also be taken online or in a community college for less money? And those other intro-level courses at Duke are usually large lecture classes, unlike the pedagogical experience afforded by intro-level foreign language courses which are smaller and have higher contact hours.The fourth argument claims that since Pratt doesn’t have a foreign language requirement, neither should Trinity. But Pratt is a school of engineering, and Trinity is a liberal arts institution; the schools have different missions. Moreover, while not a liberal arts institution, Pratt doesrequire a writing course and five courses in humanities and social sciences, which include foreign language courses. Other outstanding technical schools in the U.S. such as MIT and Caltech also have robust humanities course requirements, including foreign-language courses.The fifth and final argument claims that, if the goal of studying a foreign language is to foster “global understanding,” then there are other, non-foreign language courses that facilitate attaining that goal, and so foreign language courses should not be required. But this suggests a rather superficial, generalizing sense of “global understanding,” one that might also be obtained from, say, watching YouTube travel videos. On the contrary, studying a foreign language uniquely exposes one to the experience of trying to think in a different language, a different conceptual-historical-cultural scheme, to maneuver in a different “world,” and invites one to look through others’ eyes, speak others’ tongues, inhabit — however partially, however “minimally” — others’ lives and ways of living. It doesn’t foster a unifying, generalizing “global understanding.” Rather, it can induce defamiliarization, the experience of otherness and the sense of not being at home everywhere — precisely the kind of experience that is resistant to the leveling of all into a universal, instrumentalized and increasingly global English patois.Based on the reasoning outlined here, I think the column does not successfully make its case. In conclusion, let’s briefly consider why, for the monolingual English speaker, acquiring facility in a foreign language and, more importantly, acquiring the higher-level experiences that are enabled by that facility in the foreign language — study abroad, engagement with intellectual works in the foreign language, etc. — should be an essential part of a liberal arts education. As mentioned above, the acquired ability to orient oneself in a foreign language and culture is first of all to undergo the discomfiting but ultimately transformative first-personal experience of not knowing one’s way about, and then expanding one’s ability to think and feel, to cotton on to and be enriched by a “world” that is different in terms of intellect and sensibility, to inhabit two worlds instead of one, to lose one’s sense of self-certainty and then find a different, more complicated self in a different, more complicated world. Let me provide two (admittedly anecdotal) consequences of attaining this kind of intellectual growth in a foreign language and culture. First, foreign language study has intrinsic value: It is the beginning of what can be a lifelong trajectory of personal growth, expansive horizons and enriching experiences. My foreign language studies led to extensive living and working experiences in Russia, Germany and Italy and engendered relationships that continue to this day. To name just a few of my more recent experiences, I’ve interpreted Russian-German for Ukrainian refugees in Berlin, worked with an Italian doctoral student in philosophy, partaken in a literary event via Zoom in St. Petersburg, served as an evaluator for a Canadian dissertation in French and more. None of these opportunities and eventualities occurred to me when I was choosing what courses or majors to take as an undergraduate, but none of them could have happened without the choices I made back then. Second, from a narrow, vocational point of view, foreign language study has far-reaching, though indirect, extrinsicvalue. A quick Google search will yield CEOs, medical school presidents, tech leaders, etc. insisting on the value of liberal arts and language study to their professions. I was hired after college as a “knowledge engineer” (AI was being hyped hard then as it is now) by an MIT startup firm to work on building an AI expert system in the financial services domain. My major in math/CS was important because they knew I could learn their proprietary programming language quickly. But decisive was my second major in Russian and my experience living abroad because they indicated a mental agility and ability to learn, communicate and “translate” between the software developers and the MBAs whose “knowledge base” we were attempting to formalize computationally. Thus, in my view, the question is not whether the foreign language requirement should be dropped, but rather why one would wish to narrow the horizons of a Duke liberal arts undergraduate degree.Henry Pickford is a professor of German Studies and Philosophy and the Director of Undergraduate Studies in German Studies at Duke.The Chronicle is committed to highlighting voices from the Duke community.

In defense of neutral space,Marc Brettler,2023-12-11T05:00:00Z,Dec,11,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101123-brettler-neutral-space-defense-20231211.html,"On December 5, I had the honor of convening “A Talking Circle on the War in Israel and Gaza: Sharing Our Pain” alongside Professors Abdullah Antepli and Peter Casarella. This event was sponsored by The Duke University Chapel, Duke Divinity School Center for Reconciliation, Fons Vitae and Student Affairs. Over 40 people — undergraduates, graduate and professional school students, staff and faculty — attended this two-hour event, where we were able to share the pain that we are feeling following the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 and its continuing aftermath. At five tables, we introduced ourselves, our reasons for attending and our connection to the current crisis. In the second round, we talked about our personal pain about the Oct. 7 attack and the war in Gaza. Finally, in the third round, we reflected on our experience participating in this event and what other events we would like to see moving forward.Based on a model from my former institution, Brandeis University, I convened this event amidst the increasingly deafening silence of our Duke community to engage in civil, respectful and honest discourse. For two hours, we listened to each other attentively and respectfully. Participants in the event — spanning a broad swath of political, religious, socio-economic and ethnic divides — called for more spaces at Duke in which to engage in civil discourse with people other people with differing viewpoints. While this event was only a small step towards fuller dialogue, it nevertheless was a step — one that hasn’t been taken by many — to accommodate more than just one viewpoint.Participants expressed their appreciation for the chance to engage in a space where we may not agree on a resolution of the current crisis, but where we all agree about our anguish at the tragic loss of human life, while still being able to stand within our own sense of justice. After two months of feeling unable to engage anywhere safe, it was constructive to hear from someone coming to this crisis from a completely different viewpoint who, by virtue of actually taking part in this event, could be trusted and clearly wanted more than to shout obscenities or express platitudes or slogans.I very much hope that other units of Duke University, and Duke’s administration, will early next semester follow up this discussion with a broader set of events, from a variety of perspectives, to better edify the Duke community. Talks, panels, seminars and discussion groups may focus on issues such as genocide, describing colonialism and its effects, national security, just wars, antisemitism, Islamophobia, nationalism and tribalism, the history of the Middle East, the limits of free speech at the University, the fate of displaced people and the impact of war on the environment. It is clear from the event last week that spaces to discuss such issues are sorely missed — and much-needed — on our campus.Marc Brettler is the Bernice and Morton Lerner Distinguished Professor of Jewish Studies in Trinity College’s Department of Religious Studies."
"Duke's commitment is to fossil fuels, not the climate",Duke Climate Coalition,2023-12-08T05:00:00Z,Dec,8,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/100823-duke-climate-coalition-20231208.html,"The COP28, the annual summit where nations gather to assess the world’s progress in fighting climate change, is currently undergoing its second week. This year’s summit is being held in the United Arab Emirates under the direction of Sultan Al Jaber, an Emirati politician and oil executive who, according to recently discovered documents, is using the event to promote fossil fuel production by lobbying other countries. Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General António Guterres is warning the world that “humanity has opened the gates to hell” by failing to take aggressive actions to mitigate climate change. Our politicians are gathering at a conference where key leaders plan to discuss the expansion of fossil fuels without seemingly any care for how that impacts our future.Fossil fuel companies soil everything they touch. It was true in the 1980s when they promoted climate denialism despite their own scientists warning otherwise, and it is true now, as they continue to donate millions to campaigns and universities to further their mission and prevent climate action. Thus, for our society to successfully combat climate change and fairly transition to a clean energy economy, we must kick fossil fuel companies out of climate policy discussions, especially at the universities that conduct much of the world’s climate science research.However, as we demonstrate in our recent report, Duke has received more than $20 million over the past decade from fossil fuel companies and allied foundations to fund research and other university operations. This includes funding from ExxonMobil and Chevron, which was used to sponsor Duke’s Energy Week Conference in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. The conference in 2021 also featured an event with executives from Chevron and another fossil fuel company, helping promote fossil fuels as a viable energy source for the future despite their known contribution to climate change. More concerningly, ExxonMobil has provided a lab in the Pratt School of Engineering with hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund applied mathematics research that is used to improve oil drilling technology.When it announced the Climate Commitment last year, Duke positioned itself as a leader in the climate education and research space, but this data suggests that the fossil fuel industry may be influencing our school’s research outputs. While donations from fossil fuel companies to climate initiatives may seem to reflect a desire to do better, their motivations are likely profit-driven. Recent studies have shown the findings of academic research funded by fossil fuel companies are often biased toward continuing the global usage of fossil fuels. We cannot trust that research at Duke funded by these companies will accurately reflect the urgency of the clean energy transition. Moreover, fossil fuel companies are unreliable partners in the climate action movement, even when they claim to support decarbonization. Corporations such as Shell and BP committed billions of dollars to supporting renewable energy in 2021, when oil prices were low, but have pulled back on these commitments this year as they have made record profits. Duke needs to cut all ties with fossil fuel companies to ensure that it is actively supporting climate action and decarbonization, rather than playing into the interests of big oil.In addition to calling for Duke to no longer accept research funding from fossil fuel companies, we urge Duke to divest its endowment from fossil fuels. Duke continues to invest its $13.2 billion endowment in fossil fuel companies, despite over a decade of student activism and a referendum in 2022 in which almost 90% of Duke undergraduates voted in support of divestment. Divestment promotes the transition to a clean energy economy by decreasing the valuations of fossil fuel companies in the stock market and making it more difficult for them to raise money to expand their operations. Furthermore, dozens of Duke’s peer institutions have made the decision to divest, including Cambridge and Brown, contradicting our school’s assertion that it is leading the way on university-level climate action with the Climate Commitment. Duke is choosing to ignore the extensive academic research supporting the efficacy of divestment and instead continues to profit off of the polluting oil industry.The fact that COP28 is being overrun by fossil fuel interests means that the impetus is on local institutions to lead the charge for climate action. Prominent universities like Duke are well-positioned to take a leadership role in the climate action space, as they have both the financial resources and research expertise needed to design effective environmental policies. However, Duke is currently just as intertwined with the fossil fuel companies as are the politicians at COP28. Our school needs to rise above the low bar set by our world leaders and cut all financial ties with the fossil fuel industry. Only then will Duke fully uphold the ideals set forth in the Climate Commitment and emerge as a trustworthy advocate for global sustainability.The Chronicle is committed to highlighting voices from the Duke community.

The convenience of more,Aaron Siegle,2023-12-08T05:00:00Z,Dec,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/120823-siegle-convenience-of-more-20231208.html,"The last lap in Mario Kart when the music speeds up. That critical stretch of a football game after the two-minute warning. The last 0.2 miles of a 26.2-mile marathon. All three make an apt comparison to the hectic pace of the final few weeks of the semester between Thanksgiving and Winter Break. With finals, projects, shopping and holiday social gatherings all crammed into a few short weeks, the sentiments of joy and gratitude which are supposed to define this season get pushed to the wayside.The end of the year fuels our desire for more. More A’s. More gifts. More money. More Christmas cookies. This ethos of more has extended into the realm of the politics with the rise of the Abundance Agenda. Its logic is pretty straightforward. If America could just produce more of everything, it would be a better place to live, right?While abundance may be an inevitable result of prosperity, it creates the risk of seeing objects merely as disposable. With the prevalence of mobile ordering and ubiquity of to-go boxes, it is apparent that Duke has a significant waste management problem. However, the real issue of promoting disposability is that it creates a consumer culture where things only retain value as long as they are useful to us. In the name of ""efficiency"" — the pinnacle of all modern values — old products can be replaced almost instantaneously and quickly vanish out of sight and therefore out of mind.Let’s be wary of the simplistic logic that more is always better. Why? Because more is the quick-fix solution that solves the symptoms of a problem without addressing the root cause lurking beneath the surface. Often, more is meant to remedy one discrete issue without considering the unintended consequences — a painless excuse to kick the can down the road for just a little longer. In the words of environmentalist John Muir, “When we try to pick anything out individually, we find that it is bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken, to everything in the universe."" When we reach for quick fixes, such as ChatGPT for homework and social media for relationships, we get that instant gratification of saving a few minutes and being more efficient. But what we don’t see is what is declining in the background: our friendships, our health, our intellect, our individuality, our environment, our future. Commitment takes dedication, and dedication isn’t efficient.This lack of commitment makes it difficult for us to protect things that exist on different timescales than our rapidly paced lives, such as the environment. Our markets have keenly adapted to these tastes and preferences, implementing innovations like free returns that fuel our commitment-phobia. Again, the promise of the quick fix to generational problems causes us to tout technological innovation as the only path to progress. As Pope Francis points out in his letter Laudato Si’, “To seek only a technical remedy to each environmental problem which comes up is to separate what is in reality interconnected and to mask the true and deepest problems of the global system."" Trusting in technology alone is like playing a never-ending game of whack-a-mole. We are so focused on hitting the moles that we never take a moment to step back and understand why the moles are appearing in the first place.This technocratic paradigm prioritizes technology as a means to gain control over something else, usually nature. This puts humans in an adversarial relationship with nature, seeking to extract as much as is possible. While we may think we have control over our own technology, technology diminishes our decision-making capacity and forces us to conform to its logic if we want to live in modern society. The glorification of STEM at Duke and across American academia blinds us to our utter dependence on technology and its impact on the environment. While technology can be truly transformative, it must be coupled with responsible use and a clear direction to have a real impact.We can’t hope for a breakthrough in nuclear fusion or electric vehicles to magically solve all of our environmental problems. Since the turn of the century, the US economy has grown while carbon emissions have fallen, providing hope that economic growth and sustainability can be compatible. Ironically, this progress has been undercut by technological innovation. Time and time again, advances in technological efficiency have induced more consumption, termed the rebound effect. As cars become more fuel efficient, for example, it spurs people to drive more. This phenomenon puts human behavior at the center of addressing the climate crisis. So, while improvements in technological efficiency and sustainability are paramount to building a climate resilient economy, they must be paired with cultural change (rejecting the convenience of more), to realize lasting gains.The solution to the climate crisis starts with us, not with some fancy infrastructure project or five-year plan. We must dissociate growth with expansion and understand that growing as individuals and as a society will require a decrease in our reliance on things. This starts with small, seemingly insignificant things like taking the bus instead of driving between East and West Campus and asking our loved ones to give us experiences instead of the junk of the future this holiday season. Creating a culture that values meaningful experiences (e.g. playing sports with friends) over conspicuous consumption (e.g. shopping sprees) is an overlooked yet indispensable step to avert an ecological catastrophe.Already, I find hope in the simple actions students are taking across campus to fight throwaway culture. Devil’s Thrifthouse combats the pervasive problem of clothing waste. Zero Waste K-Ville is an important first step to encourage circular economics on campus. Duke Campus Farm allows students to experience agriculture firsthand, an experience that grounds us in the intrinsic value of food. Each one of these initiatives promotes a culture of commitment, finding joy in doing things merely for their inherent meaning.So, in case you asked: No, more is not always better.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity sophomore.

No place like home,Valerie Tan,2023-12-08T05:00:00Z,Dec,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/120823-tan-no-place-like-home-20231208.html,"It is that time of the semester. Gone are the picturesque red and orange hues of fall, the delicate interplay between the crisp autumn breeze and the warm touch of sunlight. Winter has pulled no punches in asserting its arrival with desolate, gray skies that only seem to fade into darkness earlier and earlier with each passing day. The earnest voices in our heads imploring us to press on just a little longer have lost their vigor, with the current cycle of midterms still underway despite finals already looming dangerously close. Battling burnout from the constant socialization and sleep deprivation, most of us scramble to pull ourselves together for the impending final sprint as we struggle to chew what we bit off a little too enthusiastically at the outset.“I can’t wait to go home.”The prevailing sentiment finds no better expression, and it could not be more palpable at this time of the semester. Across a campus battered by cold and exhaustion, the warmth of home beckons with the promise of sanctuary.Yet, unfathomable as it might seem, part of me used to dread going back home to Singapore.For me, home was a tight leash after months of unbridled autonomy. It meant relinquishing my hard-earned freedom, even if only temporarily, and enduring incessant nagging, relentless scrutiny and an unreasonably strict curfew. It was a manner that bordered on sheer infantilization. It meant having to reaccustom myself to coexisting with family members in a shared living space all the time — a thought I didn’t particularly relish, having grown too comfortable in the privacy of my single room.Going home for no more than a couple of weeks entailed a schedule packed to the brim with back-to-back meetings, biannual affairs with dear friends that were almost impossible to call off or postpone. Every encounter was heartwarmingly reminiscent of our schooling days, but left me feeling torn between a yearning for extended company and the need to preserve my personal time and sanity. Amidst the intense socialization, what was intended as much-needed respite from the hustle and bustle of college life often ended up devolving into a trial of emotions and endurance, with hardly any time for proper rest and recuperation.But perhaps, above all, home was a place I had worked tirelessly and pleaded fervently to leave as soon as I was old enough to realize the option existed. It was a place where I had spent years slogging away in a stressful academic environment that bred an unhealthy obsession with paper qualifications and grades. I was tired of being surrounded by people who seemed to be living out predetermined fates and conforming to conventional archetypes. I eschewed these prescribed and predictable choices, and the way they threatened to pigeonhole me into neat categories, leaving me feeling helpless and insignificant. Quintessentially conservative and ruthlessly pragmatic, home was too small to contain my ambition, too sterile to nurture my creativity and too unforgiving for self-exploration. I feared that re-immersing myself in this environment would unravel the delicate tapestry of individuality I had painstakingly woven in college. I did not want to be relegated to just another brick in the wall once again, my self worth reduced to a volatile game of metrics. I recoiled at not-so-subtle attempts by friends, family and even strangers to impose an expiry date on my life abroad. The looks of disappointment or disapproval that my bold intentions for the future garnered ate away at my conscience. They were discomfiting reminders of the glaring disparity between my individualistic pursuit of self-fulfillment and the collectivist Asian ideals that most people back home subscribed to — a discrepancy I will always struggle to reconcile.However, as the time I spent away from home steadily increased over the past two years, resistance gradually melted into longing.I’ve grown weary of living up to the new persona I’ve created for myself, no longer fuelled by the novelty of starting afresh in a foreign environment. I miss communicating effortlessly in the colloquial tongue, Singlish, after conditioning myself to speak proper English in America. There is something perversely satisfying about expressing certain nuances with a combination of sing-song intonations, ridiculous grammar, jarringly inaccurate phonetics and elusive discourse particles, in a manner that only a fellow Singaporean would be able to fully comprehend. I miss having limited and clearly delineated pathways to pick from now that I am mired in a complicated web of career choices and plagued by the added uncertainty that comes with being an international student. Being pigeonholed into a pre-existing category, as it turns out, is a lot easier than carving out a niche for myself. Going back to living under the watchful eyes of my mother is certainly stressful. But nestled somewhere between the incessant nagging and relentless scrutiny are little nuggets of wisdom and a parent’s enduring love for her grown-up child, which I am slowly learning to embrace and appreciate. I pine for the company of old friends, who share the same understanding of cultural references and high school anecdotes, sparing me the trouble of giving verbose rundowns that don’t quite capture the same essence. I always wonder how they’ve changed in the time we’ve been apart, having only followed their lives through screens from afar.As much as my perspectives on life are diverging from the prevailing ideologies at home, I’ve realized that I still cling firmly, albeit subconsciously, onto core beliefs, values and living habits that I had been inculcated with or exposed to while growing up. No matter how much I reconstruct and renew my identity as I learn more about myself and the world around me, there will always be pieces of home ingrained deeply within me that I carry with me wherever I go. So, here we are again, at that time of the semester, when the frigid breath of winter ushers in the stress of finals season, and the comforting warmth of home lures with the assurance of refuge. I, too, can’t wait to go home. Valerie Tanis a Pratt junior. Her column typically runs on alternate Wednesdays."
Statement from Duke Students Supporting Israel: Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorism,Duke Students Supporting Israel,2023-12-07T12:27:00Z,Dec,7,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/100723-duke-students-supporting-israel-20231207.html,"No one could have imagined the horrors of the Hamas terrorist attack that began on Saturday, Oct. 7. Israelis near the Gaza border woke up to sirens at 6:30 a.m. — unfortunately an all too familiar sound. But the attack took an unprecedented turn in the horror and trauma that Hamas inflicted on Israelis — Jews, Muslims and Christians alike. Our hearts hurt for the thousands of Israelis and Palestinians whose lives have been taken in this war. After the barbaric murdering, beheading, raping and setting ablaze of innocent people in Israel, Jews could not fathom how life could become more terrifying. Yet in the past few weeks, Jewish people have felt the world turn against them. In Russia, an antisemitic mob stormed the tarmac where a flight from Tel Aviv, Israel had just arrived. A Detroit synagogue president was found stabbed to death outside of her home. A swastika was proudly held up at anti-Israel rallies in New York, a state with approximately 1.9 million Jewish people — the second-largest Jewish community after Israel. Perhaps most chilling to students our age are the threats of violence towards Jews on college campuses so severe and real that some resulted in canceled classes. As the war unfolds, and with it a slew of global antisemitism, it is natural to seek a deeper historical understanding of this region plagued with unprecedented violence. Summarizing Israel's history in one article is an impossible task, but the following information can serve as a start for providing clarity on the current situation. Jewish people and the Land of Israel More than 3,000 years ago, the Jewish people were a civilization in Israel, where their unique culture, language, traditions and religion came to life. Over the centuries, this land was overtaken by several empires and renamed Palaestina by the Romans, who expelled the Jews. However, the Jewish people never left entirely, physically or spiritually. Painting Israel as a colonizer or occupier is a demonization and delegitimization of the Jewish people’s right to self-determination in their homeland. The saying, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” is a call to claim all land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea as Palestine, therefore dismantling the world’s only Jewish state and removing all the Jews from the land. Demanding for a Palestinian state should not mean, as this phrase proposes, denying the right of the State of Israel to exist. Such an extreme demand — one that is hardly extended to any other country in the world deemed a colonized country — is clearly antisemitic and is a threat to the existence of Jewish people. The reason Israel is not an apartheid state Jewish people make up the majority of Israel’s population, but the country is incredibly diverse, with Muslims, Christians, and Druze all living in the same land. Many of today’s activists and organizations, such as Amnesty International, still claim that Israel employs a system of apartheid against these minorities. This is a falsity perpetuated to fit a social justice-based narrative painting Israel as the oppressor. Apartheid is defined as a policy or system of segregation or discrimination on grounds of race. In Israel, there is no physical segregation in public spaces and no requirement of race on ID cards. Two million Arabs live peacefully and successfully in Israel, serving in the Israel Defense Forces, voting in elections and holding positions in the Knesset. Thousands of Palestinians utilize the Erez crossing to work in Israel every day. Moreover, Israel notably removed all Israeli soldiers and civilians from Gaza in 2005 — even removing many Jews from their homes in the process — granting full sovereignty to the Palestinian Authority. Unfortunately, the civilians have been governed by Hamas since 2006, when this terrorist group won its seat via a free election. So how can Israel be an apartheid state over a land they do not even politically control?As such, the accusation of Israel as an apartheid and colonial state is an attempt to delegitimize the existence of the State of Israel. Those who utilize these terms often do so in an attempt to rationalize the actions of Hamas and its goal to wipe Israel and the Jewish people off the map. Israel’s democracy is not perfect — like any other democracy in the world, it faces social and political challenges. In fact, most Israelis themselves are dissatisfied with the government, and many engaged in peaceful demonstrations in defense of democracy for almost 40 weeks straight. But despite this, citizens being dissatisfied with certain democratic policies does not mean that Israel is not a democracy. Hamas, the true oppressor Hamas — recognized as a terrorist group by the United States, countries of the European Union, Canada, Japan, Israel and others — is founded on genocide ideology and antisemitic beliefs comparable to that of Nazi Germany. The Hamas Charter emphasizes its goal to annihilate Israel. One does not even need to read far into the charter to understand its intentions, as it states in the preamble that, “[Israel] will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it.” Hamas violently ejected the Palestinian Authority (PA) in Gaza in 2007 and has been the cause of a horrendous humanitarian crisis for Gazans ever since. Despite receiving millions of dollars in humanitarian aid every year, Hamas diverts this aid money and uses it towards terror operations and rockets; it siphons millions of dollars from Gaza aid workers; it stockpiles fuel, medicine, food and more while Gazans suffer; it restricts the rights of women and Christians; it segregates schools based on gender; it incarcerates Palestinians for speaking out against policies of Israel’s destruction and as well as for being gay. The EU itself has had trouble determining if their aid is helping the Gazans or Hamas. This is not new for Hamas, as the New York Times covered the crisis of Hamas stealing aid back in 2009. The billionaires of Hamas spend their funds and fuel on rockets and destroying Israel, while innocent Palestinians suffer under Hamas’ control, lacking typically easily accessible resources. It is possible to be sympathetic to the Palestinian struggle while also condemning Hamas for its terrorist behavior.The Oct. 7 terror attacks Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre and the ensuing terror imposed on both Israeli and international civilians is NOT resistance. It is terrorism. Babies have been slaughtered. Over 230 civilian hostages were taken forcefully to Gaza, from infants to the elderly, and many have yet to be returned. Women were raped so violently that blood rushed down their legs, entire families were burned alive with their hands tied behind their backs and Hamas used shovels to behead and dismember extremities. Innocent people, many close in age to us, were murdered while enjoying their time at a music festival that celebrated peace. Innocent lives have been lost both in Israel and Palestine. It is Hamas that fires rockets indiscriminately at Israel from just steps away from Gaza's schools, hospitals, mosques and civilian living quarters — using civilians as human shields. The IDF takes many measures to warn civilians before attacks, dropping paper leaflets and “roof-knocking” for civilians to leave. The IDF has even established an escape route from Gaza, yet it is Hamas who has reportedly guarded the route with troops to shoot at people trying to leave. Such measures to protect civilians in enemy territory during a time of war are rare. It is Hamas who broke the ceasefire with their attack on Oct. 7, and who has, numerous times already, violated the ceasefire and hostage deal that went into effect last week.Since 2001, Palestinian terrorists have conducted at least 2,000 terrorist attacks on Israelis. Thus, Israel uses its military not to subject Palestinians to “indiscriminate warfare” but to protect Israelis from the constant threat of terrorism and extermination that existed long before the Jews achieved self-determination. Anti-Zionism IS antisemitism Many people make the argument that anti-Zionism exists separately from antisemitism. However, the numbers speak for themselves. In just the first three days after the Oct. 7th massacre, before Israeli retaliation, antisemitic attacks and calls for violence against Jews increased by more than 1,200% worldwide. At rallies, pro-Palestinian activists have called for the destruction of Israel, chanted to “gas the Jews” and proudly displayed Nazi swastikas. Around the world, Jewish people’s homes were marked with the Star of Davids, Jewish-owned businesses were vandalized, Jewish communities’ synagogues were reduced to rubble and a Jewish student’s doorway was set ablaze in their dorm building. These acts of Jew-hatred resemble those seen in Germany in the late 1930s. Just a few weeks ago, Jewish students at Cooper Union in NYC were forced to lock themselves in the library as Palestine activists harassed them, banging on windows and shouting, “Free Palestine.” Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorism Terrorism can never be justified or “contextualized,” and it is dangerous for “resistance” and “terrorism” to be used interchangeably. Support for Palestinians does not need to occur at the expense of support for Israel’s ability to exist peacefully and without threat to its civilians. On that note, disagreeing with Israel’s government — and any government for that matter — is not an excuse to support the eradication of an entire people. To the thousands of anti-Israel protesters around the United States: Utilizing antisemitic rhetoric, ripping down posters of kidnapped children and assaulting and harassing Jewish students does not help your cause. While Israel supporters condemn Hamas’ terrorism and position as Gaza’s current leadership, we do not wish for the eradication of Palestinians. Rather, we believe strongly in Palestinian self-determination and freedom. However, we will simultaneously work to debunk misinformation that incites — or is itself an expression of — antisemitism. Israel, like any other nation, has a right to defend itself against terrorism and rescue their civilian hostages. Hamas clearly states their goal of wiping out Jews and Israelis from the face of the Earth and will do anything to achieve this goal, regardless of the collateral damage to and death of their own. Thus, calls for a ceasefire while Israeli civilians remain in direct danger are calls to allow for the continued massacre of Jewish people because Hamas will not stop killing Jews. Condemning Hamas’ brutal terrorism and hoping for the safe return of hostages — and the destruction of Hamas — deserves its own breath. In a separate — and equally important — breath, we acknowledge and mourn civilian casualties in Gaza. Such atrocities on both ends further emphasize our wish and the emphatic need for everyone — Israelis and Palestinians alike — to be free from Hamas."
Don’t limit thankfulness to a Thursday in November,Anna Garziera,2023-12-06T05:00:00Z,Dec,6,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/120623-garziera-dont-limit-thankfulness-to-november-20231206.html,"As Thanksgiving draws nearer, Americans across the nation will start to look at their lives in retrospect and reflect on the graces they have been blessed with so far.Some will consider their year to have been a particularly favorable one, while others a more unfortunate one. But in the spirit of the holiday, most will gather a small pool of riches they are grateful for: friends, family, a dog, a home.The same, however, can’t be said for a large majority of college students. Busy with midterms, class registration and Thanksgiving break plans, their bustling lives will leave them with little time for actual Thanksgiving.In fact, most college students these days are more inclined to practice the direct opposite — they prefer complaining instead.“Gen-Z complains the most in the workspace” according to a New York Post article. This is unsurprising considering what we currently see on American campuses. From grievances towards fairly standard cafeterias to classes being too far from each other on campus (God forbid we reach our step counts before noon) to classes that are genuinely challenging (we were hoping for free rides to graduation) to having 8:30 a.m. classes (which seem to be killing the U.S. college student population, slowly but surely), the complaints never end.Some students, bless them, are too proud to complain — they just skip class instead.Then again, some might argue that the reason for all this complaining is that generation after generation of young adults are eased into adulthood far too gently. With food always on the table, dad’s credit card at the ready and high school classes curving tests so steeply as to reward even extreme slackers, older generations are well willing to argue that we youngsters should get a taste of the Good Ol' Days. And maybe they are right. An easy life does not teach a child to be thankful for it, but to expect it.Thus, as the years pass, we are straying further away from the original purpose of the American tradition. In other words, our modern, privileged lives do not promote Thanksgiving but discourage it.Anyone pointing their finger at me, saying that, hey, if they’ve ever seen a privileged life, it is mine, would be right. Well, I have a confession: I used to be a complainer too.However, as life goes on, you live and you learn, and alongside many others, I eventually realized that while complaining adds nothing valuable to our lives, being grateful does.There are two main sources of complaints from college students, namely, things they can control and things they cannot. For instance, grumbling about the school cafeteria is entirely pointless (unless “daddy will hear of this”), but feeling resentful towards 8:30 a.m. classes can be productive in the short term. This is a problem that has two solutions. First, we can realize our anatomy is not especially different now that we’re in college, and we are just as capable of waking up at 7 a.m., as we were all four years of high school. Second, we can know ourselves and simply avoid taking those early morning classes as much as our major allows us to.Then, after this, there can really be little to nothing to complain about: We have resolved the issues in our control, and we simply have to accept the issues out of our control. There’s no doubt that complaining can be a stress-reliever for college students and even older adults. However, being grateful can do the same. We are young, intelligent individuals that attend one of the best schools in the country. We are pursuing an education in something that we love: our futures are in our hands. In comparison, an 8:30 a.m. class on a Wednesday becomes a trivial detail of our lives.As a rule of thumb, this is exactly what gratefulness affords us: a better perspective. By pinpointing what is most important to us, daily battles feel relatively insignificant. It can be easy to get caught up in the stress of midterm exams (which seem to be never-ending here at Duke), GPA calculations or class registration, but just one thought of the young soldiers who were drafted and pulled out of college at our age during WWII will be enough to ground us: Receiving a B+ on a Calculus exam isn’t so tragic after all.At the same time, finding grace in even the small things can bring us happiness in a different but equally powerful way. We students take so many things for granted. Correct me if I’m wrong, but today’s lunch looked especially yummy. Did you have a productive workout at Brodie the other day? Look around you: Campus is so beautiful in the fall.Blaming Life for our unhappiness, or tiredness or lack of success can relieve us of our responsibilities. However, thanking Life for being so wonderful should become one of our daily habits too.If only we saw that a five-minute walk between two classes on a fall morning is not a pain but a gift, we would all be a little happier.Anna Garziera is a Trinity first-year.

Tunnel to DKU at former Panda Express site nears completion ,Monday Monday,2023-12-04T05:00:00Z,Dec,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/120423-monday-monday-dku-tunnel-panda-express-20231204.html,"The seemingly unending construction on the old Panda Express location on BC Plaza is finally coming to a close. Seven months after Panda Express closed its doors, the tunnel to Duke Kunshan University being built in its place is nearly finished.After being a staple of dining for Duke students who loved underseasoned chicken for 15 years, Panda Express served its last rice bowl last May, leaving a gaping hole that has been under constant renovation ever since. But Bob Lattè, Executive Director of Duke Dining, confirmed in an exclusive conversation with Monday Monday that the long-awaited 11,965-kilometer tunnel that cuts through the core of the Earth to connect Duke University with its liberal arts counterpart in Kunshan, China would be completed by the next centennial. “We didn’t want Duke students to settle for budget-friendly fast food. Now we can import Panda Express straight from the motherland, rivaling the culinary authenticity of Tandoor and Il Forno,” Lattè said. Duke Dining had originally shared plans to give the space to It’s Thyme, the allergen-free dining facility pioneering a new type of food (chips in bowls). Plans to give Thyme a new space were scrapped after the concept was deemed “too radical” for the taste buds of Duke students.“We faced major construction delays. Three months into digging we unexpectedly discovered a buried bunker filled with discarded almond milk cartons and Nutella jars from Cafe,” reported Lattè. Nuh T’case, head of International Relations at Duke Dining, confirmed that with the completion of the tunnel, the entire city of Kunshan would be subsumed into West Campus policies and would therefore be classified as nut-free. “We are the first dining program in the country to connect two continents and ban peanuts in both. That’s the Duke Difference that makes us an award-winning dining program,” T’case said. T’case further confirmed that Duke Dining was in active talks with the Kunshan City government to plan how they could export Durham’s gentrification to Kunshan. The tunnel to DKU will sport an advanced shuttle called “the Pipe” that will be operated by the trusted hands of Duke Parking and Transportation. The schedule released states that the shuttle will stop running between the hours of midnight and 9 a.m. in both time zones, with a footnote that reads, “Good luck figuring that one out.” Duke Vans will not service DKU. “The Pipe will also serve as a convenient place for us to dispose of our ‘compost,’” said Lattè with a wink.The entrance to DKU at the other end of the Pipe will have three other new bowl places, including one that will have acai bowls for just $15 each. They will not be put on the Duke Mobile Order app due to concerns about the Chinese government collecting sensitive quesadilla-related data. DKU students here on their campus break will be freed from East House, sent back to China and expected to commute daily via the Pipe. In turn, East House and its original 1911 hardwood flooring will finally be allowed to be decomposed and absorbed by the cockroaches of East Campus. “Yeah, that’s cool or whatever,” said Stefan Bing, a sophomore, when asked about his opinion on the change. “But I really just want a sandwich shop on campus.” Too bad, Stefan. Another bowl place for you. Monday Monday is coping with finals by embracing a new allergen-free, nut-free, gluten-free, meatless and locally sourced diet and only drinking organic free-range water."
Singing the blues,Luke A. Powery,2023-12-04T05:00:00Z,Dec,4,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/120423-powery-singing-blues-20231204.html,"“Singing the blues” may seem to be a weird title as we travel through the holiday season and approach the end of another semester. We might think it should be a time of rejoicing. Yet if we are honest, this holiday season can be bluesy as people mourn the loss of loved ones or as we endure ongoing war, college students shot in Vermont and even local violence in Triangle area high schools. We are not always “merry and bright.”Think about it. Even at Duke, you can pull an all-nighter for that final exam but still not get the grade you hoped for. Or, you can invest in a relationship but not sense your love is reciprocated. Basically, what we expect is not always what we get, and this will cause you to sing the blues.Singing the blues is more than complaining about how, “Suzie left me, my dog Barney died, my acoustic guitar broke and Coach Elko left Duke for Texas A&M.” In “Richard Wright’s Blues,” writer Ralph Ellison defines the blues as “an impulse to keep the painful details and episodes of a brutal experience alive in one's aching consciousness, to finger its jagged grain, and to transcend it, not by the consolation of philosophy but by squeezing from it a near-tragic, near-comic lyricism. As a form, the blues is an autobiographical chronicle of personal catastrophe expressed lyrically.”This is what the ancient prophet Isaiah does when he sings the blues with these words: “When I expected it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?” (Isaiah 5:4b). He’s disappointed and distraught. His love song for the vineyard becomes a lamenting blues lyric because what he expected, he doesn’t receive. Unmet expectations will cause you to sing the blues.It’s a lesson everyone should learn. It’s a mature spiritual response to life circumstances in a world of much tragedy and agony. We should all cultivate a blues sensibility for navigating reality. The blues helps us to remain human with a prophetic impulse to speak truth, even to power when necessary.Singing the blues also reveals that you understand how love can be blue, full of questions and contradictions. What you love the best can hurt you the most, and when it hurts, singing the blues shows courage and depth.Musically, the blues notes are sometimes called bent notes. The flat seventh or the minor third bends down from the major seventh or the major third. They bend but are not broken. When life bends you with heavy winds, the blues allow you to still sing and make melodies as a sign of life and resilience.In the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, a seventy-year-old woman named Ena Ziza was found buried for a week in rubble at least three stories high. When she was pulled out of the rubble, she was seriously dehydrated and had a broken leg and a dislocated hip; however, when they pulled her out of the rubble, she didn’t ask about her 401K or her unread emails or the blog chatter about Oprah Winfrey’s TV network. When they pulled her out of the rubble, this lady began to sing. Even a blues note is hopeful because as the priest and poet Rev. Dr. Pauli Murray once wrote, “Hope is a song in a weary throat.”Singing the blues is an essential ingredient for anyone who wants to prepare for the way life is. But this should not be so difficult for you since you are already blue. You are blue devils, which is another way of saying that the blues are in your blood.The Rev. Dr. Luke A.

Sandwich smackdown: Pitchfork’s fried chicken sandwich wins gold,Jessica Luan,2023-12-01T05:00:00Z,Dec,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/120123-luan-pitchforks-fried-chicken-sandwich-20231201.html,"Few foods on campus stoke genuine delight for me anymore. This is partially due to my eating habits, as I tend to eat the same dish until I get bored. I’ve also lived on West Campus since freshman year, so I’ve tried just about every dish available, even obscure ones like Sprout’s French toast sticks and Tandoor’s dosas. My taste buds have been craving something new and different for a while now. Then I tasted the Pitchforks fried chicken sandwich. This is a meal imprinted on my mind like witnessing the initial bloom of cherry blossoms in the spring or hearing ""Everytime We Touch"" echo through Cameron. When I return to Durham as an alum, my first stop is not going to be Vin Rouge or Shooters II. It’s going to be Pitchforks, where I can relive the joy of biting into that chicken sandwich for the first time. There are definitely better fried chicken sandwiches out there, like at the Popeye’s at RDU or Cane’s on Franklin Street. But the Pitchforks sandwich is bewitchingly delicious, easily accessible and better than its on-campus competitors. The brioche bun is smooth, shiny and as soft as a baby’s bottom. The pickles aren’t much to write home about, but I think that’s the way it should be. I rarely remember amazing pickles, but I do remember ones that are limp or an ogreish shade of green.I rarely mess with chicken on campus unless their last name is cutlet (or 65). The chicken in this sandwich overcomes common chicken shortcomings (too thick, too fishy tasting or too dry). The ultra-thin cutlet is crispy, crackly, delightfully juicy and slathered in garlicky aioli. Compare that with Gothic Grill’s Gothic Southern fried chicken sandwich. The Bryan Center restaurant opened to much fanfare earlier this year, but to the chagrin of Loop lovers. Unfortunately, Gothic’s comparatively lackluster fried chicken sandwich further rubs salt in the wound. In contrast to Pitchfork's bouncy, pull-apart brioche bun, Gothic’s corn-dusted bun is a little dry. The chicken too is toothsome and stringy. The behemoth hunk of chicken overpowers the poor pickles’ feeble attempts to inject some much-needed juiciness into the meal. I hoped a pump of mayo might help to lubricate my parched throat. I actually hate mayo, so I was pretty desperate. Unfortunately, the condiment quickly overpowered the rest of the sandwich, which was a bit bland.In this campus dining oligopoly, the Pitchforks fried chicken sandwich is the better of two options. As someone without a car, it has become my ultimate comfort food. Of course, eating at two in the morning feels a little wrong. It's salty, greasy and quite hefty. I should be asleep, but instead I’m having an out of body experience in the basement of McClendon. But eating this sandwich also feels just right. At many points in this semester, I felt ready to give up and veg out. But this meal is like a beacon of light for the weary student. There’s no better feeling than tucking into a fried chicken sandwich after a long week. It replenishes my study stamina and re-illuminates the path toward my academic, personal and professional goals. Duke students have already lost Panda Express, a beloved Duke institution and purveyor of comfort foods found nowhere else, like juicy teriyaki chicken and fragrant stir-fried veggies. Like Panda Express, Pitchforks also serves high-quality, comforting and unique dishes: banh mi sandwiches, veggie lasagna and a delicious fried chicken sandwich. I’m a senior, but for the sake of future students, I sincerely hope that Pitchforks stays open and protected from the consolidation, duplication and bowl-ification of Duke Dining. The fate of fried chicken depends on it. Jessica Luan is a Trinity senior. Her column typically runs on alternate Fridays. "
Have yourself a crafty Christmas,Morgan Foster,2023-12-01T05:00:00Z,Dec,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/120123-foster-crafty-christmas-20231201.html,"If you're anything like me, the onset of consumer-driven holidays such as Black Friday or Boxing Day may leave you conflicted.On one hand, I genuinely appreciate a good deal. Whether it's doing my grocery shopping at Costco or making my own coffee, I'd do almost anything to save a buck. On the other hand, I vehemently oppose holidays rooted in crass consumerism. While I used to feel isolated in these beliefs, it seems that mainstream pop culture is starting to catch on — or, at least, it did for a moment.I first noticed this shift earlier this year when “de-influencing” — the act of discouraging people from buying products — was trending. This was a stark departure from what I saw on social media: YouTubers and Instagram influencers posing with ceramic pans or showcasing the latest Skims collection.However, this micro-trend in a sea of shifting audience preferences vanished as quickly as it arrived. Now that it's socially acceptable to decorate for Christmas, ""influencing"" is back, stronger than ever. Just hop onto any social media platform, and you'll be inundated with the latest Christmas items you supposedly ""have to have” — from Home Depot's viral Christmas Tree (who knew a Christmas tree could go viral?) to CVS's Snoopy plush toy in a puffer jacket being resold for double the price. This holiday season, there's no shortage of stuff.While the typical holiday spending sentiment often goes unchecked, a new trend seems to be emerging: the concept of ""Crafty Christmas."" This style of celebration aims to reject the conventional ""Consumerism Christmas"" and embraces a gift-giving style based on homemade items and crafts. While homemade gift-giving is not a novel concept, the motivations behind it are. There seems to be a growing proportion of Gen Zers who are accustomed to viewing social media as just another means to sell you more things but are growing weary of swiping past ad after ad after ad. ""Crafty Christmas"" was born from this discontent, with certain influencers sharing videos of DIY projects such as homemade orange garlands or handmade soaps.With reports of a cool-down in consumer spending coming out of last week's Black Friday, I imagine more people will forgo store-bought gifts — not out of protest, but out of necessity.So, if you're still unsure about what to get Mom this holiday season, might I suggest the very original — and not at all cliche — hottest gift of the year? Give the gift of a coupon book with desirable redemptions such as ""doing the dishes"" or breakfast in bed. Morgan Foster is a graduate student at the Nicholas School for the Environment.

Gatsbys at Duke University,Advikaa Anand,2023-11-30T05:00:00Z,Nov,30,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/113023-anand-gatsbys-duke-university-20231130.html,"I unclip my hair from the roller and fasten gold hoops into my ears. My hair bounces in blow-dried waves on my shoulders, my loose waves cascading to the edges of “DUKE” emblazoned on my navy blue sweatshirt. My sloppy gait has turned into a confident cadence, and I grow sharply aware of my surroundings.Like Gatsby, my transformation is complete, and I am ready to return to Duke.My sister was the first to notice the gradual changes eroding my previous self after I arrived at college. In her sassy little sister’s way, she labeled me as “materialistic.” Even as I dismissed her quip, I knew deep within that there was truth to her statement — I had changed.When I look back at my high school photographs, I cannot recognize myself. My hands were perpetually tucked into the fleece jackets I wore, even on the hottest days. I have not worn my hair in its natural curly coil in nearly two years.It’s my eyes that have most changed since I came to Duke. Frozen in those photos, I glimpse at their childlike glimmer. I see the yearning for adulthood, the naive belief that upon crossing the magical age of eighteen, everything would simply fall into place.What changed?Now, when I look in the mirror, I see an unsteadiness in my deep brown eyes, the crushing realization that life is only going to get more complicated from this point onwards.I am still learning how to be an adult; I am still learning that life does not leap from exhilarating highs to debilitating lows. I am still learning that everyday life is an amalgam of ambivalence and that I must seek joy in the little things that I’ll forget one day, like jumping until my feet beg for mercy at the Diya Diwali party. I am still learning the things that make me feel good, like doing my hair and picking out a cute outfit. I don’t know why I have cared more about my physical appearance since coming here, but I do reckon it's something to do with the overall preppy, classy appearance of the Duke student body. Everybody always seems so put together, and in this new phase of my life, when I am on my own, responsible for myself, I want to be put together too. And when I look into the mirror and my hair is smooth, and the color of my shoes matches my shirt, I am relieved of my anxiety, firm in the belief that if I can look good, my life outcomes will be good too.I do recognize the superficiality of my belief. And I do realize that looks mean little in the grand scheme of one’s success or failure. But I also know that when I look good, I feel good. And that’s not such a bad thing.Because under these color-coordinated outfits and matching jewelry, I know that we are all falling apart. As young adults aged 18 to 22, our worlds are constantly shifting beneath our feet. As we make new friends throughout college, we watch our old friendships from high school and even our first semester fall apart — some painfully, others invisibly. We began to endure the stresses of real life — finding a job, battling financial burdens and navigating complicated relationships. We gaze at our future, uncertain and fearful of what lies ahead, only to find that seeking solace in our past is no antidote. All our lives, we wanted to grow up, and now that we finally have, and our tastes of adulthood are bitter, all we want is to go back.I look back at photos of myself from what feels like long ago: younger versions of me who looked at growing up as a “happily ever after” where all one had to do was find love and a job for everything would be okay. But I am starting to realize that growing up from our past selves is not like erosion, erasing the old memories in favor of new ones. Instead, our past and present versions are like the rings of a tree, ever interlocked with one another, and rooted in the people who knew us in those forms. I still become a little girl when I return to my parents’ home, annoying my little sister by tugging her hair and lying down on the floor with my golden retriever. I still lurch back into middle school gossip with my childhood friends, giggling about the couple pairings in our seventh-grade dances. I still clap with delight when my grandmother sprawls old photo albums across my lap, asking her the same questions I did the year before and the year before that. These past versions of ourselves aren’t lost, only hidden until we are around the people who carved them.Sometimes, I think about whether I would return to a previous me, a me who knows what’s coming and can easily navigate the familiar struggle. Nothing would be new. Nothing would be hard. But then I look at my roommate’s sleeping face and think about how I sleep better, knowing she’s in the bed next to mine. I look at my best friend and think about how I no longer fear loneliness because I know she carries a piece of my heart in hers. I look at my sister and think about how glad I am that we no longer hate each other, but instead, how we are growing to be each other’s confidantes. I look at my professors and think about how they challenge my mind to adopt new ways of thinking and marvel at how the world looks different than before I took their classes. Would I return to a previous iteration of myself?I do not think I would.Advikaa Anand is a Trinity sophomore. Her column typically runs on alternating Thursdays."

Some students jump into their four-year plan early and decide to knock out some of these requirements. Some of us — myself included — wait until this becomes an unavoidable reality. As a self-proclaimed non-STEM student, I found most of these areas of knowledge to be relatively easy to fulfill. The two areas that stumped me were the natural sciences (NS) and quantitative studies (QS) requirements. I was fortunate enough to be able to find some science courses that I was able to justify taking because they were somewhat related to my academic areas of interest. However, the QS courses were a struggle to fulfill. I looked at computer science — but I don’t like coding, nor do I have any prior experience. I did well in my math classes in high school — but at Duke, the math courses covered very specific concepts and were unlike anything I’d seen before. I even looked at the statistics courses that people recommended but then I remembered, I don’t like stats. Beyond the fact that I simply don’t like or want to take QS courses, they are not connected to any of my professional interests or aspirations. Does a journalist need to know how to code? Does an author need to understand calculus? Reading comprehension, cultural competency and historical knowledge are universally applicable skills for all students. However, being able to code or do calculus is only relevant for students who want to pursue a career in STEM. The QS requirement is unnecessary, and doing away with it would give non-STEM students like me more freedom to pursue our academic and career interests. Some might argue that STEM skills like web development and statistical analysis are necessary too. I would argue that this is not true. While it might certainly help an entrepreneur if they can code their own website themselves, website development is already its own career path and a web developer with strong coding skills can be hired for the job. It might help an attorney if they know how to analyze statistics, but if they are involved in trial work, for example, they would call up an expert witness to conduct statistical analysis and present this information to a jury. A liberal arts education “offers an expansive intellectual grounding in all kinds of humanistic inquiry.” However, these kinds of humanistic inquiry must be relevant to students or they are a waste of time. Departments like African & African American Studies, International Comparative Studies and Gender, Sexuality & Feminist Studies arguably do just that without requiring students to take any QS courses. Their interdisciplinary nature means students are already exploring a plethora of academic disciplines. The main difference between QS skills and social science skills is that QS skills are specific to fields or paths under the STEM umbrella. The social sciences deal with human behavior and society — something that is relevant to all of us.The QS area of knowledge forces students to spend valuable time covering STEM concepts instead of exploring their academic interests. A STEM student can say the same thing about social science concepts, but even doctors, engineers and software developers need to know how to read and analyze dense written material and engage with people and cultures different from their own. In contrast, many of the careers that we as non-STEM students aspire to pursue don’t require a knowledge of quantitative concepts beyond what we already know coming into college. We understand mean, median and mode. We know what standard deviation means in the context of a dataset. We know how to add, subtract, multiply and divide. We can calculate percentages. Computer Science 101 and a collegiate math course don’t really offer much to students who do not wish to pursue a career in tech or related STEM fields. Sure they teach problem-solving and exercise a different part of your brain, but doesn’t every academic department do this to some degree? Non-STEM departments like history, cultural anthropology, and African & African American studies all teach students valuable life skills applicable to any career. That is why other requirements such as the Civilizations (CZ), Social Sciences (SS) and Arts, Literature and Performance (ALP) areas of knowledge teach students cultural competency, history, critical thinking and reasoning. These courses are also accessible. Pre-med students can find courses related and relevant to their interests in medicine. Computer science students can find courses related to technology and its role in society. What equivalent exists for students forced to take two math classes? In contrast, many courses are not accessible to students who don’t come from a STEM background. A course can say that coding experience is not required, but true beginners will be lost when drop/add is over. A math course can market itself to students just looking to fulfill a requirement, but when the concepts are not taught well, as I have experienced firsthand, these students can be left more confused than before.I understand that my professional interests are unconventional as a Duke student, but the QS requirement does not teach universally useful skills. It’s okay to not know how to code or do advanced math. It is not okay to lack reading comprehension skills or cultural competency. We’re not all destined to pursue STEM and that should be acceptable.Sonia Green is a Trinity junior. Her column typically runs on alternate Tuesdays."
Do you really need that master's degree?,Heidi Smith,2023-11-27T05:00:00Z,Nov,27,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/112723-smith-do-you-really-need-that-masters-degree-20231127.html,"Just like four years ago, for myself and fellow seniors, it is again the time to be incessantly asked what we are to do after graduation. This is, of course, an incredibly annoying question until you have arrived at a satisfying answer. This time, however, the response is not so clear cut: No longer is it as simple as offering the name of a college and receiving a judgment proportional to your questioner’s opinion of the institution. While we broadly could do any number of things next, it tends to boil down to one of two options: entering an applicable industry or continuing to go to school.Until relatively recently, I was somewhat split on which path to take, but it was always a question of a job in industry or a doctorate. Several of my family members are in academia, which influenced my ideas on the topic, but it boils down to this: If you get paid to do a doctorate — albeit not that much — which is worth more than a master’s in the long run, why would you pay for a master’s? Attending Duke’s Graduate School costs over $60,000 a year in tuition, and, from my understanding, financial aid is not nearly as available as it is for undergraduate students.When discussing with others throughout the past few years, they were often confused as to why I would choose between two vastly different options — essentially, a software engineering job or an English doctorate degree. Why don’t I just get a master’s — either in English or CS, my undergraduate majors — and see how I liked it? The sentiment is there, but our tendency to choose the middle course is a prime example of the Compromise Effect. When confronted with three options — for which two are extremely different and one exists in the middle ground — humans tend to compromise even when the middle option might not be what we really want.I can understand why individuals with parents who are willing and able to fork out the extra cash for tuition and basic needs — as the amount of money a full-time student can make on the side tends to not be in the range that would cover all living costs at most graduate institutions — succumb to this marketing tactic. At this point, I will clarify that I am critiquing penultimate master’s degrees. I understand that, in some fields, a master’s is the highest degree an individual typically earns — and that select careers have a requirement of one — however, these tend not to be the most popular paths for Duke students.I have nothing against going to grad school. Indeed, I think getting a doctorate can be an excellent option for some people. You should get a doctorate if you are highly passionate about your field of study and feel that deep research into some facet of it would make you happy. Here’s the thing: If you’re sincerely passionate about the subject, there’s no need to get a separate master’s degree — unless you win the Rhodes or Marshall or something — because you get one for free as you complete your doctorate. Now, don’t tell them I told you this, but if you enter a doctorate program and decide it’s not a good fit, you can usually leave amicably with a free master’s degree after a couple of years.Otherwise, if you are more interested in applying what you’ve learned at Duke to a particular industry — or just want to be a consultant — if you’re using your time here semi-wisely, you should know enough about the field to succeed in it within your four years. Otherwise, the curriculum needs revision. I estimate I learned at least 70% of what I needed to know about Computer Science from school by the end of my freshman year, if I include my high school CS courses. Each subsequent year, I’ve gained bits and bobs of useful information from most of my major courses, but boy howdy have I reached the point of diminishing marginal returns. I am positive that if I, say, enrolled in the new 4+1 program in Computer Science here or did a separate master’s elsewhere, I would deepen my understanding. Yet, I can guarantee I will learn efficiently, whilst elevating my knowledge, by becoming a software engineer instead. After an internship in the field, I realized how little I knew and that while my Duke education has given me a lovely foundation, if I want to reach my full growth potential, I must apply my knowledge to real-world problems. Yes, people holding master’s degrees have higher earning potential, but that’s only once you graduate and make up for the tuition spent — if you don’t have wealthy and generous parents — and the salary not earned from not working. Plus, you won’t make as much money as people who get doctorate degrees and decide to work in industry — and may not be qualified for research-intensive roles in all cases.Industry is a slightly more nebulous option because saying “I’m working in the industry” means different things to everyone. I’ll broadly think about this in terms of traditional industries that Duke students are wont to enter, like tech, business, finance, etc. Having a traditional 9-5 job means you’re probably getting paid big girl money, living in a new city and having free time for hobbies — though, forget that last one if you’re going into investment banking. Frankly, it’s more fun if you, like me, realized at some point in the past few years that you love learning but don’t enjoy being a student.Plus, above all else, leaving academia is something different, and by that nature, you will grow in some way. We have been in the educational system all our lives; how much more can we gain from being a student for one to two more years? If you love the subject in an academic capacity, two years is surely not enough; if you’re more a fan of applied stuff or maybe even dislike your major in the first place, a master’s degree is long enough to be somewhat tortuous. A master’s is the choice most similar to the life we, as undergrads, currently lead. For any of these options — or if you choose a path less beaten — you need to know why you’re doing it and be able to articulate that to another person. What a master’s degree really buys you is a little more time — is that what you need, or would a handful of courage to make a riskier decision suffice?Heidi Smith is a Trinity senior.

The case for maximalism,Angikar Ghosal,2023-11-27T05:00:00Z,Nov,27,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/112723-ghosal-maximalism-case-20231127.html,"I love Taylor Swift. In the music video for “Delicate,” she breaks free from the usual scrutiny and normative pressures to act in certain composed ways and can dance happily in the rain, as she says “you must like me for me”. What a call for authenticity! Except that she is a celebrity whose tweets and media appearances are planned and polished by a PR team.When I was in high school, my English teachers, who were trained in Victorian English, said that American English is “simpler,” discourages passive voice and considers baroque vocabulary as “purple prose.” America is the land of Hemingway — simple, curt prose that gets the point across. Simplicity is seen as a proxy for authenticity — expressing the real emotions of real people. Except that pop culture is anything but authentic — think of big entertainment corporations producing films that have anti-capitalist sympathies, the same film studio producing mass-consumed superhero films and ""alternative” superhero shows that mock superhero movies. Federico Fellini made “8 ½” about creative blocks; now we have authors writing about the act of writing all the time. Even human communication is not authentic: We text in order to please the other person, we speak in a way to make the other person agree, we act to impress our crushes and we write our college essays agreeing with the professor’s views so that they give us a good grade. More importantly, op-eds are not authentic! The thing about op-eds is that either an article echoes the overwhelmingly agreed view and did not convince anyone new, or it is an unpopular, hot take … and the article did not convince anyone new! Is there any incentive to write something that is not already agreed upon? Are op-eds not written more to increase one’s reach among an audience than to actually reveal one’s opinion? I asked my friend A****** to write an op-ed that no one disagrees with, and alas! There was no opinion at all! Here is an excerpt from it: “…Paris is the capital of France. Blackwell dorm has three floors. Vincent Price is the current President of Duke. Duke basketball is better than UNC basketball…” I found this compendium of mundane, banal facts boring, and hence asked A****** to simulate an affable demeanor, feign a sympathetic tone and write an op-ed. Here is an excerpt from it: “…Remember, you are valuable. It is okay — take a deep breath. Maybe one day we will all realize … We are all hurting from…” I personally find this frivolous consoling voice equally mundane and repetitive. My friend hence advocates for maximalist prose that abandons any pretense of authenticity, any attempt to be written for readability. A deliberate ornamental vocabulary till it appears kitsch to critics — precisely because no one speaks like this. Leo Strauss advocated for “esoteric writing,” often disguised within irony or paradox, obscure references, and even deliberate self-contradiction. Unfortunately, I am not as well-read as Borges, as to refer to the Slovene philologist Franz Miklosic, the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten and the Roman historian Flavius Josephus next to each other. If you do not have an encyclopedia to repeatedly sample from, note that you have access to the master distribution known as the Oxford English Dictionary! All that needs to be done is adjust the process so that lower probability outliers do not get excluded as much. Kurtosis enhancement.One day, I woke up to see a very long text message from A******, which I reproduce here in its entirety. A proof of concept if you will: “In a world where lexicon has been systematically diminished, and the once-rich tapestry of linguistic complexity reduced to a threadbare narrative; a call emerges from the quagmire of simplicity. The prose of our era languishes in the stagnant shallows of mundane expression, devoid of the nuances that only an erudite vocabulary can bestow. ""The burgeoning homogenization of language has precipitated a deleterious erosion of intellectual rigor, rendering modern literature an insipid elixir for the literary connoisseur. In a lamentable turn of events, the ineffable beauty of polysyllabic opulence has been forsaken for the jejune allure of accessibility, as if profundity were the trade-off for comprehension. Such wanton reductionism has consigned the written word to a paltry existence, bereft of the kaleidoscopic brilliance that a rich, esoteric vocabulary can offer. ""But it is time to transcend the facile comforts of simplicity and ascend to dizzying heights! For only through the labyrinthine intricacies of obscure diction can the true literary elite be separated. The lexicon, replete with sesquipedalian gems, shall become an exclusive domain, accessible only to those willing to laboriously excavate what is concealed beneath layers of linguistic artifice. ""Let our smartphone screens flash with lexical conundrums woven together in a syntactical ballet. Let prose become an arcane incantation with enigmatic profundities. It is through the deliberately sadistic opacity of language that we shall forge anew the boundaries of excellence. Let the rarefied air of obscurity become the oxygen of intellectual vitality. In this intricate web of complexity, we shall find the apotheosis of communication.” Hence, to finish off, here’s an excerpt of an op-ed I co-wrote under the guidance of my friend, which I paste here. He has, for long, behooved me to read the 50 volumes of the Sacred Books of the East so that my sample space of words expands further to incorporate, for instance, Avestan vocabulary.I have not edited his work to be fully publishable, maybe someday in the future. “…At Duke, success is ostentatious but clandestine, conversations are erudite but convivial, policies are persnickety but inclusive, social life is effulgent but inscrutable, research areas are recondite but vivacious, students are perspicacious but hedonistic, protean but cohesive, punctilious but bohemian…” Look at that! Supremely sophisticated syllables scribing somewhat superfluous, sadistic sentences! Peculiarly, passionately practiced, perplexing, pretentious, parodying, pathetic purple prose!

Ditch your four wheels and get on two: Biking to campus can improve your life,Bridget Gregory,2023-11-20T05:00:00Z,Nov,20,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/112023-gregory-biking-improve-life-20231120.html,"While we are conditioned to believe cars are the most convenient method of transportation, this is typically untrue for the daily commute of an off-campus Duke student. Many of us are well acquainted with the frustrations of Blue Zone parking, but the actual time inconvenience it creates is astounding. Here’s the breakdown: For a student living in Berkshire 9th Street apartments, the 1.7-mile drive to the Blue Zone takes approximately 6 to 8 minutes. Once there, scouting out a parking spot adds another five or more minutes. Finding a reasonably distanced parking space is rare, so most of us are forced to park in the back lots. The trek from the back of the Blue Zone (Lot 7) to Perkins Library takes a whopping 17 minutes. Even the walk from Miracle Lot to Perkins is still 11 minutes. In total, your commute could be anywhere from 22 to 30 minutes!Alternatively, biking could cut your commute in half, as a bike ride from Berkshire Ninth Street to Perkins Library is only 11 minutes. Not only is biking more time efficient, it will also save you money. The cost of purchasing a Blue Zone parking pass for three years is approximately $1,350. This is roughly double the price of an electric bike, which could be used for four years and beyond college. Parking rates elsewhere on campus can add up — not to mention the exorbitant fees incurred by parking tickets. Why pay so much for inconvenient parking when you could buy a bike for a fraction of the cost?As a senior who has tried every method of transportation to get to class, I implore my off-campus peers to consider biking or even walking instead of driving to campus. Alongside the logistical and economic benefits of switching up your commute, you can also help the planet. Increasing emissions of greenhouse gasses is one of the biggest drivers of climate change as these gasses trap energy in the atmosphere and thus warm the planet, with carbon dioxide (CO2) as the biggest contributor. In the United States, transportation accounts for the most CO2 emissions out of any economic sector, with personal transportation creating the bulk of these emissions.The average passenger car emits 0.47 pounds of CO2 per mile traveled. A commute of four miles (about the distance from Berkshire Main to Duke Campus and back) done five times per week will emit about 550 pounds of CO2 each academic year per person. The 1,350 parking spots in the Blue Zone are consistently full, suggesting a substantial number of students continue to rely on personal vehicles for daily transportation, which contributes to the unsustainable release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. If 1,000 students switched from driving to biking, they would collectively reduce CO2 emissions by 249.5 metric tons per year — the equivalent CO2 emissions of 31.4 houses!For students like me with a seemingly endless number of tasks and never enough time in the day to get it all done, switching up my commute has made an extremely positive impact on my day-to-day lifestyle. No longer do I stress about finding a parking spot or scramble to leave my apartment in time to allow for a 30-minute commute. Instead, I enjoy my short bike ride and arrive to class on time and relaxed. So, why don’t you try it out? Shorten your commute, save some money, reduce your stress and seamlessly work a bit of exercise into your daily routine, while also combating climate change. It’s a change that is good for you and good for our planet. Bridget Gregory is a Trinity senior."
Common aspirations,Luke A. Powery,2023-11-20T05:00:00Z,Nov,20,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/112023-powery-common-aspirations-20231120.html,"When I look on Twitter (now called “X""), I see people posting critiques, distinctions, problems, gaps, chasms; they tweet about persecution, vitriol, celebrations of terminations and divisions. One doesn’t often come away from reading Twitter thinking, “Wow, that was for the common good!”In contrast to what’s on Twitter, I think of Maya Angelou’s poem “Human Family,” which begins:I note the obvious differences in the human family. Some of us are serious, some thrive on comedy. The variety of our skin tones can confuse, bemuse, delight, brown and pink and beige and purple, tan and blue and white… But then, the poem ends with this twist: I note the obvious differences between each sort and type, but we are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike.We are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike.Maya Angelou gets it right. We are diverse. No one person is the same and that’s a gift; I’ve written about this in books. We all have distinct grains in our own wood. But we also have things in common, and in these days of serious splinters and bogus binaries all across the world, I challenge us to search for what we have in common.Looking to the Bible, I find two important phrases about this search for what we have in common: “had all things in common” (Acts 2:44) and “for the common good” (1 Corinthians 12:7). Both of these texts are in the context of experiencing the divine Spirit. That is, that somehow to experience the divine Breath leads to what is common or held in common. In the ancient faith communities reflected in these sacred texts, the people shared their lives together—and the divine creates the common. We see the aspiration of the common good rooted in the spiritual.I experienced an example of the divine showing us what we have in common when I taught in a federal prison last Spring semester. In that class comprising inmates and Divinity School students, we saw clear distinctions between those inside the prison and those outside of it. Clothing was different. Living environments were distinct. Access to resources was not the same. Quality of food surely was different — there’s no Brodhead Center in a prison. Freedom of movement wasn’t the same. Engagement with the outside world was different. The differences were obvious. But beyond learning the course content, seeing what was common was the calling. Those behind bars and barbed wire miss their families just like we do. Some struggle with addictions just like we do. Some are gifted artists just like some of us. Others deal with mental health issues, just like those outside of prison. If we are open to the divine Spirit, we see these common human experiences and recognize that we hold some things in common.Seeing what we had in common in that class was a blessing, but in our time, it’s as if the common is a curse to avoid rather than something to be embraced. Maybe we don’t want to be in the camp of the common folk or be considered ordinary. Think about how what is deemed common can be shunned — ""that’s commonplace” or “those commoners.” The common and common folk have been ostracized historically and viewed negatively. This is why we’re always trying to transcend the common experience to be or do different and therefore supposedly better and greater and uncommon. When applying to college you want to set yourself apart and not be common. This helps you stand out from the pack. But in everyday life, you shouldn’t have to be distinct in order to be accepted.The difference, the variation, is what’s often stressed or searched for in our time. We often focus on what divides us rather than what is common between us. In some way, this might indicate a distance from the divine. Don’t get me wrong. I affirm human diversity wholly because it’s a reflection of divine beauty, but the questions I have on my mind as we approach the Thanksgiving break are about what binds us together. So, as you take time over break to rest and renew relationships with family and friends, I invite you to consider the common aspirations we might have by pondering these questions:What is common between us?Where is the common ground these days?What are you doing for the common good?Shall we be disjointed or joined together?The Rev.

We need a better way to get groceries,Zubin Rekhi,2023-11-17T05:00:00Z,Nov,17,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/111723-rekhi-groceries-campus-transportation-20231117.html,"A few weeks into the semester, I was missing the simple, affordable and soul-satisfying meal of sunny-side eggs and a refreshingly cold glass of milk that I prepared for myself everyday before work in summer. The meal was as cheap as it was simple, and I enjoyed the satisfaction of cooking it. So, in search of a carton of eggs and milk, I went to the West campus convenience store — only to realize that there weren’t any there. I was out of luck and didn’t have the time to take the C1 and then trek 10 minutes to Harris Teeter or Whole Foods. The cooking had to wait.The food on this campus is absurdly expensive, even compared to basically all comparable schools. But, while ruminating on methods for cost-cutting, I was struck by how far students need to go to buy basic ingredients for simple foods they might want to cook in their dorm s. After all, aren’t foodstuffs like Wonder Bread, a carton of milk, a carton of eggs, and cereal college student staples? Apparently not, according to the administration's current approach to expanding dining options. The issue is larger than just expanding the set of snacks sold at the Duke Store or at Bella Union. On campus, students’ only means of getting to a proper supermarket is borrowing a friend’s car or waiting for a delay-prone shuttle, and having to struggle for basic groceries and amenities can only be expected.With the substantial time commitment and bandwidth students must invest to get basic groceries, it makes sense that concerns over high food prices at dining halls and rationing food points loom as large as they do at Duke for many students. If students could substitute their $12 latte and chocolate croissant, with the more economical (and might I add, delicious) option of a “homemade” peanut-butter and jelly sandwich, I am sure that many would.Additionally, considering West Union, the main dining hall, closes at the relatively early hour of 9 p.m., it’s imperative that students have access to healthier and more varied options than McDonald’s, Pitchforks or vending machines after that hour. Better access to groceries would solve this problem: If students can get their hands on basic ingredients (like peanut butter) for making a midnight sandwich, they wouldn’t have to eat McDonald’s.The solution to this problem is simple: I propose a direct shuttle that frequently goes directly to Harris Teeter and back. Currently, shuttles only relay students between East and West Campus, leaving the responsibility of efficiently transporting students from off-campus locations to West Campus unfulfilled. Duke Vans only provide a similar service within a limited boundary. Current policy’s explicit goal is only to bring students safely back to their residence halls after-hours, not to improve student convenience by making their shopping or dining trips any easier during the day. In a particularly car-centric part of the South, providing students with no shuttle alternative amounts to denying students without cars access to basic amenities and groceries and conditioning their ability to acquire such necessities on the likelihood that a friend or an acquaintance with lend them their car. After all, walking from Whole Foods — the less affordable but closer alternative to Harris Teeter — to the East Campus bus stop while lugging groceries with friends in the baking summer heat or bitter winter cold is a frustrating experience.Students deserve better.The problem with the administration’s current shuttle model is its prioritization of the bare minimum — keeping students safe on-campus — without respecting any other concerns about students’ time or needs. By expanding the shuttle service to a department store, the administration would take care of manifold problems instantly, opening the door for easier food budgeting and expanded late-night food options for students who don’t have the bandwidth to surmount the current barriers to going shopping.Zubin Rekhi is a Trinity sophomore.

New caps on Duke-approved programs are elitist,"Ellie Armstrong, Chris Paré",2023-11-16T05:00:00Z,Nov,16,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/111623-armstrong-pare-duke-approved-program-caps-20231116.html,"Upon reading about the new 50-student cap on each Duke-approved program and the six-student cap on petition programs, we are incredibly disappointed. Studying abroad is meant to be a time of self-discovery, and this restriction not only adds stress to the student body but also promotes an elitist socioeconomic culture and a Western superiority complex. For students with the financial means to study abroad with no cause for concern, this decision likely won’t affect them — at least financially. However, with students who are struggling to pay for Duke, Duke-approved programs are a fantastic way for them and their families to save money. Colleges on the approved list are significantly cheaper than the full bill for Duke, enabling students to graduate with less debt and increased agency. It seems to us that with the new cap, many students won’t be able to reap the financial benefits of doing an approved program, promoting an elitist culture that favors the financially stable. Especially in line with the recently published David Leonhardt article about Duke's lack of economic diversity in the New York Times, this decision seems ill-timed. Further, the Duke-In programs perpetuate the belief in Western education’s superiority. The Duke Global Education Office claims “the best international study abroad and U.S.-based study away programs deliver high caliber academics, a strong support system, and the chance to integrate intellectual inquiry into a mosaic of cultural and personal experiences.” Yet, we are discouraged by the lack of geographical diversity among the semester-only options: Berlin, France, Glasgow, Madrid, Venice and Rome. Of 18 Duke-In summer programs, Duke in the Arab World, Brazil and Costa Rica appear to be the only non-Western options available for students willing and able to pay for a study-away experience. Therefore, Duke-approved programs are often the only financially feasible ways for students to spend a semester abroad in a non-European country. Student caps on Duke-approved programs will actively discourage students from seeking these options. Students must already submit individual courses for approval and accept that their courses will likely not count towards their major or affect their GPA. Alongside these hurdles, student caps further limit access to studying in the non-Western world. Consequently, they exacerbate the mentality that Duke places greater value on Western educational systems. Students have the right to know where this decision came from and why we were unable to have a say in this policy change. The Global Education Office must be transparent about its motivations in implementing this policy change to foster a more open and just environment.Ellie Armstrong and Chris Paré are Trinity sophomores.

Contradicting Elsa: Sometimes it’s okay to not 'Let it Go',Advikaa Anand,2023-11-16T05:00:00Z,Nov,16,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/111623-anand-sometimes-okay-not-let-it-go-20231116.html,"A bright neon red sign hung outside my elementary school guidance counselor’s office. In delicate letterings, it laid out the steps one ought to take if their feelings had been hurt. The first steps outlined various combinations of having open conversations with the other person and being honest about your feelings. The final step, however, was highlighted in neon yellow and big bold letters: Step 5: Be the bigger person. Forgive, and move on. “Be the bigger person. Forgive, and move on,” I whispered these words to myself over and over again, ingraining them in my heart. At first, it was easy to follow this directive — to forgive and forget. It was easy to forgive the boy in my second-grade class who made fun of me because I was Indian; after all, he didn’t know any better. It was easy to forgive the girls in middle school who didn’t let me dance with them in our Street Jam performance because I was the new girl in the class; after all, they didn’t know any better. But as I grew older and learned to distinguish the difference between intention and action, it became harder and harder to leap over my feelings and move on. Not only was I finding it more difficult to forgive others but also to forgive myself and move on, especially as my expectations from both others and myself grew more demanding. I developed a deep fear of getting in trouble and upsetting others. If I did, I knew I’d have to tussle with my own inner guilt — a reckoning that I found deeply troubling. My tendency to ruminate over the difference between intention and action and overthinking whether I could expect someone to know better and eventually, do better is not well taken in a culture that prizes forgiveness. An unwillingness to move past our own feelings and forgive is often seen as a sign of arrogance and pride. It’s unpopular to posit that sometimes, it’s okay to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being over the disconcerting sentiments of another person — after all, most ethical tenets seem to suggest that in order to become the best versions of ourselves, we must be better than our worst embitterments.But such a view oversimplifies the nuances of forgiving. As Saumya Kalia of The Swaddle Project puts it, “The association of forgiveness with strength and moral superiority is wildly dismissive of genuine emotions and experiences.” To push the person in pain to leap over their aching hearts diminishes the gravity of their feelings and invalidates their sensitivities, an action that can reinvigorate previously borne trauma by compelling people to gaslight themselves over their emotions.Psychological research reveals this dark side of forgiveness. As a 2014 study by James McNulty found, “The tendency to express forgiveness may lead offenders to feel free to offend again by removing unwanted consequences for their behavior.” Immediate forgiveness, posits McNulty, enables people to avoid repercussions such as “anger, criticism, rejection and loneliness” and, eventually, escape accountability for their behavior.Forgiveness is not easy. Telling people to cope with their pain by justifying the actions of those who have wronged them and encouraging them to jump to immediate forgiveness and move on does not offer a solution that is sensitive to their emotions. But that doesn’t mean that it should not be done.Ultimately, forgiving someone is not about them; instead, it’s about us — it’s about our choice to rise above the pain that they have caused us, but only when we are ready, if we are ever ready. This process is not one that can be rushed — it may take days, weeks, or months for individuals to reach a place where they can decide that they are finally okay. This nonlinear path to healing is only disrupted by moralizing advice on the magnanimity of forgiveness.On the contrary, what we must prioritize — even when someone has wronged us — is compassion. No matter how we may seethe with anger or writhe with pain, we must never cease to see them as living, breathing human beings with stories as vivid and complex as our own. Yet, while these stories may serve as explanations of their hurtful behavior towards us, they will never suffice as justification for their actions, a basis for blanket, immediate forgiveness, or permission for complete reentry into our lives. Nor will the ways in which they have rewritten our story serve as any pretext for us to be outwardly unkind or cruel to them.Because they are still people.But they are no longer our people.Advikaa Anand is a Trinity sophomore.

Duke needs to address its failure to identify human rights impacts when investing,Duke Amnesty International,2023-11-15T05:00:00Z,Nov,15,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/111523-amnesty-international-human-rights-due-diligence-investment-lack-20231115.html,"Duke Amnesty International is calling upon the Duke University Investment Management Company (DUMAC) to take responsibility for ethical decision-making regarding their investment of the Duke endowment.In April of this year, Amnesty International released a report titled “Failing Grade: How University Investment Offices Often Fail to Conduct Human Rights Due Diligence When Investing in Venture Capital Funds.” The report analyzed the venture capital investments of the 10 American universities with the largest endowments in terms of human rights due diligence.Duke received a failing grade of 17 out of 40 in terms of human rights due diligence and investment transparency — a D.Human rights due diligence for investors is defined by Amnesty International as “identifying human rights impacts linked to their operations and investments (both potential and actual), taking effective action to prevent and mitigate against them, and being transparent about their efforts in this regard.”Duke has failed to demonstrate such due diligence on a number of fronts.First, Duke is not a signatory to the UN Principles of Responsible Investment, which outlines a number of commitments to consider environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues with investment decisions. A number of Duke’s peer institutions, including Harvard and the UC system, are signatories.DUMAC’s ESG policy is vague and ineffective. In the “Responsibility” section of the DUMAC’s website, the organization claims to be “dedicated to adapting [their] processes and actions to ensure that [they] are incorporating ESG considerations in a way that aligns with industry best practices and delivers value to [their] clients.”However, DUMAC operates by coordinating with a number of external investment managers over whom they appear to have little real oversight. In 2022, DUMAC established a framework to assess the ESG footprint of their investments in line with sustainable development goals, and they explain on their website that they “collaborate and try to understand” the ESG policies of investment manager partner companies. In a student town hall held on October 25 by the Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility (ACIR), though, Chief Operating Officer of DUMAC Anil Madhok revealed that only 70% of the organization’s investment manager partners have formal ESG policies in place. Although this represents an improvement from an estimated 30% in 2018, this failure to incorporate universal ESG policies in Duke’s investment practices is unacceptable.Duke also received abysmal scores for investment disclosure and transparency in the “Failing Grade” report: zero out of nine possible points. Duke was reproved for failing to disclose its investment holdings to the public, ESG performance data in their annual reports, and its proxy voting records to the public.In response to a question posed by Duke Amnesty International during the ACIR’s student town hall last month, DUMAC’s Head of Legal and Compliance Robert McGrail stated that the organization has “enhanced the transparency” on DUMAC’s website since the release of Amnesty’s “Failing Grade” report. If transparency has been enhanced, it has not been done in a way that is easily accessible to the general public, as Duke Amnesty International found no information on DUMAC’s investment decisions on the website.The final area of concern is accessibility. In attempting to address our concerns with Duke’s investment practices, Duke Amnesty International ran into a number of roadblocks.After reaching out directly to the President of DUMAC, Neal Triplett, we were informed that DUMAC does not engage with student groups or individual students to discuss investment matters. Instead, all questions and concerns are redirected to the ACIR, whose purpose is to advise the President on investment recommendations he makes to the Board of Trustees. The Board then makes recommendations to DUMAC, which engages with external investment management companies for the final investments. Such a roundabout process does not facilitate student engagement with the governing bodies over the Duke endowment and instead keeps them several degrees removed from the process.Even engaging with the ACIR through the defined grievance process presents students with difficulties. The ACIR holds student town halls once a year to hear questions and concerns from students about investment practices. In the most recent one on October 25, newly-appointed chair of the ACIR Emma Rasiel expressed the committee’s willingness to hold such forums more frequently, noting that there would be one planned for Spring 2024.The ACIR does not take meetings with students but invites them to submit formal reports outlining their concerns. The timeline for communication after these reports is unclear, though. On occasion, groups have gone over a year without a response from the committee, as is the case with the most recent formal report from Duke Climate Coalition that was submitted in December 2022 and has still received no written response.Duke Amnesty International is currently in the process of submitting a formal report for consideration, and we hope it to be met thoughtfully and in a more timely fashion than past reports have been. Given this arduous process, we decided it was important to educate the Duke student population on the university’s investment due diligence failings through this guest column.The student body deserves to know whether their university’s operations are being funded responsibly and in line with Duke’s institutional values. Duke Amnesty International asks DUMAC to reform its investment responsibility practices by engaging in human rights due diligence, improving investment transparency, and amending the grievance process to better facilitate communication with community stakeholders."
Campus buses to install spikes to more easily kill cyclists,Monday Monday,2023-11-13T05:00:00Z,Nov,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/111323-monday-monday-buses-cyclists-20231113.html,"Following backlash about unsafe and inaccessible infrastructure around campus, Duke University Parking and Transportation introduced a new fleet of all-electric buses equipped with spikes on the front and sides to more easily kill the cyclists on Campus Drive. “They keep taking up all the space in the lane and slowing down the C1. Something had to be done,” said one driver of a blue Tesla who preferred to remain anonymous. The new buses feature state-of-the-art spears positioned at the front and side of the buses to perfectly skewer any cyclist or skateboarder who dares to brave Campus Drive. “We tried to warn them, but they just wouldn’t listen,” Carlie Pimento, head of Parking and Transportation, told Monday Monday. “We expect this transit upgrade to shred a full 45 seconds off the C1 bus route time. Instead of wasting time swerving around a cyclist, we can go straight through them.” The decision was lauded by Campus Drive commuters of all sorts. “Those cyclists are just so damn entitled,” first-year John Volkswagen said. “Why don’t their parents buy them a Jeep like normal?”“I’m no fan of scooters on campus. Why do they think they can take up a whole lane?” asked Teeni Koch, a senior who drives a Ford Ranger and would go on to complain about the lack of parking on West Campus.In an effort to cut costs, the new buses have replaced bus drivers with AI. The AI has been trained to perfectly shut the doors right before you’re about to get on and will deploy homing technology to take special aim at cyclists without helmets and children. “I’m not a fan of the new speedbumps on Campus Drive,” said one driver who had unwittingly run over at least two sophomores who were walking along the shoulder of the road near the Arts Annex.When asked if it was concerned about the lost tuition payments from the fallen students, Parking and Transportation responded that if students can't afford a BMW and a parking pass to drive to and from class every day, they’re probably unwanted on campus anyway. This program goes hand and hand with a new initiative from the Landscape Architect’s office, “Skater Hazard Initiative for Termination,” to combat the skateboard epidemic by removing all curbs on campus. “The skateboarders on the steps of the Chapel are posing a public health risk unlike any we’ve seen in the last four years,” Landscape Architect Bark Tough said. “They are dangerous, no-good delinquent juveniles,” he said about the students who were just looking for sick places to shred. Tough asserts that the boards and loud skating on the Chapel have posed threats to students’ lives all over campus.“The gnarly shredding is just totally throwing off the sacred vibes of the Chapel aesthetic, bro,” one representative from the Facilities office said. “We’ve gotta put the kibosh on it.” The S.H.I.T. program includes a ten-thousand-dollar appropriation to smooth back all elevated surfaces — including minor stairs — around campus. The edges would be replaced with ramps that are just a little too steep to be ADA-accessible.Other proposals included a plan to add 12 lanes to Campus Drive to make it a limited-access superhighway. “The traffic from senior midnight breakfast was terrible,” said Gus Guzzler, a senior. “The only way to solve it is to add more lanes.” The plan was scrapped after campus engineers decided a Campus Drive expansion would not destroy enough homes.The initiatives are part of a longer-form plan to support the Climate Commitment by removing all cars from campus except Teslas. A spokesperson from Parking and Transportation confirmed that although cyclists and skateboarders would slowly be banned from campus, student-athletes would be given special allowance to keep their scooters so long as they were capped at a “slightly-faster-than-a-brisk-walk” pace. At press time, plans for the S.H.I.T. program and C1 Spike Installation had been delayed because a rogue student had trampled on the freshly redone Abele Grass, triggering another multi-million dollar renovation.When the skater purge comes, Monday Monday will be grinding it out on the ramps of Gross Hall.

The irrelevance of median grades,Angikar Ghosal,2023-11-13T05:00:00Z,Nov,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/111323-ghosal-the-irrelevance-of-media-grades-20231113.html,"As someone who did not go to high school in the United States, it quickly became apparent to me that there lies an intriguing peculiarity prevalent among both students and professors — the phenomenon of unwarranted and disproportionate attention being given to the 'mean' and the 'median' grades for quizzes, mid-term examinations or similar assessments. I have long held the notion that the 'median' grade is a mathematical formula that possesses no justifiable presence while defining grade thresholds. A lot of courses at Duke — especially large, intro-level lecture classes — are characterized by a statistical 'curve,' the precise shape of which is contingent upon the mean and median scores. Courses graded on a curve are often too large in size to really adopt newer pedagogies and alternate grading systems that are only viable in small class settings — unless such courses lower academic standards. Note that peer institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have long abolished grading on a curve. One must recognize the inherent arbitrariness of requiring the accomplishments of students to conform to an arbitrarily chosen statistical distribution and fix the fraction of students that get an A or A-. Grading on a curve tends to impede collaborative efforts among students, as it removes any incentive for a student to aid their peers because doing so could render them at a strict disadvantage if they have already solved a given assignment. This begets a culture where help received from teaching assistants is guarded like a rare Pokémon — beating the curve gets prioritized over the extent of learning. Certainly, Duke courses tend to guarantee a minimum grade contingent upon some percentage threshold, such as 93% or above being an A in the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences. In theory, such a dictum may be efficacious. Nevertheless, many course assessments are specifically so designed that the predefined numeric thresholds for absolute grading prove impracticable owing to the difficulty of assignments, time constraints in examination settings. and so on. There exists a simple remedy: We recalibrate the yardstick of assessment by positing the maximum score achieved in an examination as the new 100% and setting grades based on the new spectrum. For instance, someone getting 90% or more of the highest scorer’s grade should receive at a minimum an A-. Of course, analogous to the current system, the grade boundaries can be adjusted, and students in the left tails of curves could be bumped up. A more salient concern lies in the absence of any compelling rationales warranting attention toward the average performance. It is a peculiarity of current grading systems that makes people unjustifiably preoccupied with the median scores. There have been many occasions when I have not performed well. But should I ascertain the highest performance by another human, who is also a full-time student at Duke like me, I can precisely figure out how much I could potentially improve. It is more worthwhile to pursue zeniths that are already tangible realities, already embodied by other students at Duke than purely theoretical possibilities. If the current grading system did not emphasize the median score, what compelling imperative is there for anyone to be satisfied (or dissatisfied) with the fact that their own performance is “five points above the median?” No sprinter has ever juxtaposed their prowess against the “average” participant in all NCAA tournaments combined. There is a reason why athletic prowess is measured in terms of negative deviation from the peak performance. Sure, even if someone has zero chance of being as good as Usain Bolt or Kelvin Kiptum, it is worthwhile indeed to know how much one relatively lags behind the paragon of excellence. The two reasons to even dream of climbing Mount Everest are, firstly, it exists to be climbed, and, secondly, it has been climbed before and conquered before. There are innumerable areas where I discern myself to be insufficiently talented to make any mark, but I strive to know what the extent of the gaps are and which gaps merit the expenditure of time and effort for partial amelioration. Duke is an elite school, yet most coveted achievements have scant regard for Duke's median. If you want to get admitted to your favorite law school or earn your favorite scholarship to study in the United Kingdom, you must harbor no illusions: Not only are they indifferent towards the median, but they are also steadfastly fixed on finding the foremost and resplendent. Even if Duke is a top-ranked undergraduate school, Harvard Medical School is still competitive. The knowledge of beating the average in organic chemistry at Duke neither tangibly enhances your prospects nor offers a rational basis for emotional solace. Of course, metrics for brilliance vary widely across disparate domains of knowledge, and I too often lament my absence of certain talents. Diversity of skillsets across domains does not proffer rationale for complacency. Duke should avoid creating scenarios where one’s happiness is merely a perverse elation from surpassing one’s dorm neighbors and roommates of past romantic partners, and that means grading reform — especially in large intro-level classes which tends to pit student against student, friend against friend. This can be achieved without diluting academic quality and rigor — all that I am asking for is to prevent unnecessary antagonistic competition between students. One’s true competition should be with oneself. The implementation of an evaluative schema that abolishes the concept of grading on a curve and instead uses absolute grading scaled in accordance with the highest scores engenders a scenario wherein the reaction to achieving a 94% shall be the same, whether or not the scaled average is a 67% or 97%. In that utopian realm of learning, one's solitary rival is none other than oneself, and the sole endeavor lies in motivating personal improvement.Angikar Ghosal is a Trinity senior.

We need to rethink swag,Heidi Smith,2023-11-13T05:00:00Z,Nov,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/111323-smith-rethink-swag-20231113.html,"If I could acquire some branded material object for free and neglect to do so, it feels like I’m losing money (that’s girl math, right?). Before starting college, I had heard of the promises of free T-shirts galore. Honestly, I’ve gotten fewer of those than I expected, but the overall quantity of swag I’ve received throughout these four years is just ample, but overwhelmingly so, and most of it hasn’t been from Big Duke. It’s great, and it’s awful at the same time.Herein lies the vicious symbiotic relationship between the swag giver and the swag receiver. An entity gives its members a swag item to boost morale and/or promote themselves without giving people what they really want (jobs and money). The recipient gets the dopamine hit of receiving a free item and an extra sense of satisfaction if they get any use out of the thing. The problem is, it’s not always that swag meets a real need. When it does, it’s spectacular. When it doesn’t, I’m often left wishing I didn’t get anything at all — or got something useful like an umbrella. I know it’s the ultimate first-world problem to say I’m upset because I receive too many free things. You have to admit much of this stuff is utter crap. We can’t pretend to care about the environment and then pass out oodles of plastic dohickeys that don’t have a use, each individually wrapped in single-use plastic casings.By virtue of being a college student, I must fully move at least twice a year. Therefore, I must audit the bulk of my possessions uncomfortably often. Sure, sometimes I buy clothes or shoes I end up not liking or receive a gift I won’t use, but those are often easily donated or given to a friend when I do a sort. Swag, however, continues to haunt me when I don’t want it anymore because I often can’t in good conscience give it away due to its specificity or low quality.Donation is not a panacea, however. Not for swag and not even for unbranded clothes. Sure, it’s peace of mind for the donator, but if you think everything you give away is actually going to be worn by people in your community, you may be disappointed. Yes, many of the things we donate to places like a thrift store, Salvation Army or Goodwill continue their life as the garments they were originally made into, but a larger portion will be turned into rags or raw material or perhaps shipped to another country and sold for cheap, disrupting local economies. That’s if it isn’t thrown away and considering what I see when I look inside the recycling bins on this campus, Duke students are extremely culpable of wishcycling.If you look in a Goodwill, most of the stuff there is unbranded, save for generic enough university or sports team merch. These sorts of second-hand clothing stores and charities are often made with the goal of getting the less fortunate back on their feet. While we thrift-loving college students may appreciate super random t-shirts for the period that they’re in style, people who must buy second-hand are more likely to want very neutral, casual or semi-professional clothing that they can wear to work. While they have since watered down this policy, Patagonia made the news a couple of years ago by ending their corporate branding of products. They recognized the difficulty in repurposing branded gear and have only now begun accepting select corporate customers upon expanding their ability to unbrand and repurpose their gear. Most companies do not care to do this because it’s not profitable unless your business model involves being environmentally conscious.Don’t get me wrong; I own swag items that I love dearly or use daily — in fact, I wrote the first draft of this with a pen from a career fair and a club crewneck. But getting swag almost feels like being a lab rat pressing a pellet dispenser again and — sometimes you get a treat, sometimes nothing and sometimes, frankly, a piece of shit that you have to figure out what to do with. In the period in which I was ideating and writing this article, I got two blankets, two hats, two shirts, a medal and a cup as a result of my normal actions. You must agree that this is not a sustainable rate at which to acquire new possessions.Anytime I forget to bring one of my dozen branded tote bags — Citadel, Lululemon, D.E. Shaw and Co., take your pick — to the store and have to use a plastic one, I wonder what this is all for. I think about how I probably use one tote bag twice a week and need to use these N tote bags each over 50 times to make the cost of making them worthwhile. When I get a T-shirt and medal for running a race, I get home and remember that I don’t wear T-shirts and must keep this medal forever because there’s no way to recycle it. I think about the three logoed backpacks I’ve been given that I’ll seldom use because I already have a backpack I bought in high school and will just buy a carbon copy of when it goes kaput. On the one hand, these are items that plenty of people in the world would love to have — for free, no less! On the other hand, no one who didn’t participate in the event wants a bookbag emblazoned with “Visible Thinking: Duke Undergraduate Research Symposium 2022” (and many who did do not need another one).Some might say these imprinted possessions tell a story about my life. I don’t care, though, because, above all, having more stuff than I need just stresses me out. T-shirts and hoodies half a size too small for me with my last name and soccer number and possibly my high school’s questionable Indian mascot — who the heck wants that? I’ve got Duke stuff too — at least I can still wear that out in public — mostly dorm hoodies and the weirdest random small plastic objects. Take a good look in those donation bins at the end of last semester and see how many Wannamaker hoodies and Duke Football jerseys are in there. And the career fairs — oh, the career fairs! We love to get random stuff from the companies we’d make a Faustian bargain to work at — the Bank of America tumbler, the Bloomberg Engineering bucket hat, the J.P. Morgan sunglasses, the SpaceX golf ball, the Duolingo plushie. It feels so good to get these swag items, but then you have to live with having them indefinitely unless you just throw them away.We need not eradicate swag, but we must rethink it. Does the swag item’s utility surpass the cash value to create it? Are the items something people conceivably already own and won’t need to replace with any level of frequency? We should call out organizations for making overly wasteful and useless swag. On the other side, we should normalize refusing swag that we will not use — that is unsustainably produced or packaged — or that we will just throw away. If we use a piece of clothing swag for a while and need to get rid of it, we should first see if any friends would get use out of it before making a decision to play donation roulette — at the very least, don’t throw it away. We see swag as a treat or reward, but other, more satisfactory ways exist to achieve the same or better outcomes. Say, donating the money for mediocre t-shirts towards a neutral humanitarian cause or giving out small e-gift cards to locations of the receiver’s choice. No matter what it feels like, I won’t die if I don’t take a t-shirt I will never wear from a swag giveaway, and neither will you.Heidi Smith is a Trinity senior.

Don't let your hobbies die,Susan Chemmanoor,2023-11-10T12:54:00Z,Nov,10,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/111023-chemmanoor-hobbies-student-work-passion-20231110.html,"Your hobbies are dying, and I know why. You’re in the clutches of chemistry pre-labs, or maybe you’re slaving away at problem sets. Maybe you’ve been sacrificing your sleep for your 8:30 a.m. lab. Whatever it is, your hobbies don’t feel important in comparison. So, you haven’t touched a sketch pad in months, or maybe you haven’t done yoga since you came to Duke. You haven’t sung in weeks, or maybe you can’t remember the last time you wrote a poem. You haven’t been feeling like yourself lately.At Duke, it’s so easy to devalue your non-academic pursuits. In other words, in the chaos of cutthroat academia, it’s easy to forget what it’s like to be a whole person. Maintaining a good GPA isn’t what makes you, you.Instead, your identity hinges on how you spend your time when you think no one’s watching. It’s the horrible movies you and your friends like to laugh at when you feel homesick. It’s the way you wonder if a stray cat is hungry when you see it wander across the quad. It’s the midnight shower ballads that you sing and the authors whose words haunt you at night. Your identity is not school. It is an amalgamation of what you think is interesting, soul-crushing or simply fun. Can’t that be enough? How can we convince ourselves that our little hobbies carry immense value?Well, I can tell you what not to do. Don't intellectualize your hobbies. Some passions don't need awards to prove their worth in your life. In high school, I fell into this trap of wanting to collect awards. I liked writing, so I tried my hand at poetry. I enjoyed it, but to justify this more artistic usage of my time, I said to myself, “Well, I might as well win some awards for it.” Initially, it was innocent, Scholastic Art & Writing awards gave me the creative validation I wanted, but quickly I began to write for the pure incentive to be recognized. And just as quickly, my writing got worse. It became soulless and ingenuine. I had begun to write for the eyes of other people. I wrote what I thought the judges wanted to hear. But, it’s the poems that never got awards that still remain my favorites. The pieces that never saw the light of day. The ones that make me feel like I’m snooping through my own diary. The ones that were intimately vulnerable. Hobbies don’t have to be award-winning. You don’t even have to be particularly good at them; you just have to enjoy them. There’s something liberating about simply doing something for pure enjoyment.Carve out time in your insane schedule to do things that you genuinely love, no matter how “unacademic” they sound. If you like reading, you don’t have to be obsessed with Ernest Hemingway — you can read YA fiction if it's enjoyable to you. Not everything in your life has to be part of some quest for higher understanding. Not everything in your life should be LinkedIn-worthy. Sometimes you just need a break from orgo or whichever awful math class you’re begrudgingly taking this semester. Go be awful at that instrument you haven’t played in months. Go sketch something and remind yourself why you like being creative. Hell, do a crossword for no other reason than because it's fun. As Director of Academic Engagement/cool lemur scientist Lydia Greene said to me, “Go be a person.” You’re doing yourself a disservice by committing to twenty academic pursuits you don’t even like, to reach an impossible standard of success defined by everyone else but you. This article is a call to action. I beg you to re-examine the way you spend your time. Do you genuinely enjoy the clubs you show up for week after week? Is that lab actually interesting, or did you join it because someone told you you needed to? Do you have actual hobbies or just resume-padding?I don’t mean to send you into a spiral- you have plenty of time to figure it out. Just don’t let the things that make you incredibly interesting be blindly replaced by ingenuine pursuits. Go be a whole person rife with embarrassing hobbies and nerdy hyper-fixations.

The 15-minute campus,Aaron Siegle,2023-11-10T12:52:00Z,Nov,10,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/111023-siegle-15-minute-campus-20231110.html,"A mere two decades ago, a little-known railway system whisked riders across the sprawling Duke Hospital complex. A maze of tunnels, bridges and underpasses carried little railcars throughout the cavernous complex. This was the core of Duke’s futuristic Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system — a new mode of mass transit that was poised to redefine the urban landscape. Built in the late 1970s, Duke’s PRT pioneered this flexible mode of transportation and helped elevate Duke Hospital to its world-class status. Despite the PRT’s success, the system was demolished in 2009 to make way for the construction of the Duke Cancer Center and Duke Medical Pavilion.Today, the old PRT route is surrounded by asphalt for as far as the eye can see. Across campus, crowds of students, employees and guests wait impatiently for the next bus to arrive.Reduced bus schedules. Bus crashes. Unreliable bus service. Overcrowding. Missing your exams due to the bus. These are ordinary obstacles that plague the commutes of Duke students. Moreover, these problems are made worse by reduced bus routes and operating hours. As recently as 2019, Duke Transit offered additional bus routes such as the C2, C3, C4, CCX, C1X and C1 weekend service, which most current Duke students have never even heard of. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the C1 ran as late as 4 a.m. Now, bus service ceases just after midnight. As a result, many students simply bypass Duke Transit. “I find biking is actually much faster than taking the C1 because I get to avoid stops and overcrowding,” says sophomore Tate Kahalas. This hassle, combined with overworked and under-compensated bus drivers, makes the current bus situation untenable.Bringing back PRT would solve these issues. A PRT system that services all of campus, not just Duke Hospital, would make Duke a 15-minute campus. With a minimal visual and spatial footprint, elevated PRT eliminates the need for extensive areas set aside for transit while also preserving the scenic character of Duke’s campus. PRT is often ridiculed as a mode of transit that should be relegated to Disney World. But PRT systems are flourishing globally in places like Guadalajara, Mexico, Masdar City, UAE and London. Duke’s dispersed campus layout and dense concentration of residents make it an ideal site for PRT development. With PRT, Duke can turn its transportation nightmare into an industry-defining revolution.One of Duke Transit’s greatest challenges is to handle the rush of students during peak demand. Given that Duke has condensed the period in between classes to a mere 25 minutes, the overburdened bus system must scramble to accommodate the hundreds of students who suddenly appear at the bus stop. In an attempt to handle the surge, Duke Transit added extra buses to the C1 route, but those buses proceed to sit idle (along with their drivers) once the 25-minute window is over. This is an incredible waste of both capital and labor. However, a PRT system composed of small driverless vehicles can anticipate peak demands and have vehicles waiting at high-volume stations. Furthermore, smaller, more flexible vehicles reduce the headways (time in between vehicle arrivals), meaning that a vehicle will almost always be arriving at high-demand stations. Enhanced station coverage would reduce long walks after one exits the transit system.But what about tree loss? Won’t a network of elevated towers destroy Duke’s beautiful forest canopy? Because PRT vehicles are so small, the footprint of support towers would be no more than a lamp post. The system would operate below the canopy of Duke’s majestic trees, blending into the campus ambiance.An additional environmental benefit of PRT is that there are no on-site emissions, improving air quality and reducing Duke’s carbon footprint. While Duke is working to electrify its bus fleet, the university projects it will be using diesel buses until at least 2027. Additionally, an electric bus (charger included) costs the school over a million dollars, a suboptimal investment given it will sit idle for most of its lifetime. Electric buses that have already been purchased can be used on routes that the PRT does not service, such as the Lancaster Shuttle.With average speeds of 20 to 30 mph and the option to bypass intermediate stops, PRT systems maximize efficiency and flexibility. An 18-station system would unite the current pastiche of disjointed bus routes. The riders would be able to preset their destination via an app, allowing the system to meet demand. The hospital, East Campus and West Campus would now be mere minutes away. The network is designed so that any point on campus is no more than a four-minute walk away from a station and no two stations are separated by more than an eight-minute ride. Assuming a wait time of under three minutes, any trip on campus would be no longer than 15 minutes.This seems too good to be true. How can a system simultaneously increase campus coverage while reducing travel times? To answer this question, let’s look at a campus that has been transformed by PRT: West Virginia University. Like Duke, West Virginia’s layout is disjointed and sprawling, with a two-mile gap between campuses. The university used buses to span the distance, but this resulted in extreme gridlock throughout Morgantown. As a result, the university had to schedule a two-hour gap in between class periods to allow students adequate time to commute. To remedy this problem, the school built America’s first PRT system, which opened in 1975.The change was transformational. The commute time was reduced to a speedy 11.5 minutes. Innovative station designs allow vehicles to easily bypass intermediate stops. And the system can keep up with the massive surge of riders after Mountaineer football and basketball games, an impressive feat given Mountaineer Field has a capacity of 60,000 (20,000 more than Wallace Wade). By switching from country roads to country rapid transit, WVU has found a long-term solution to its connectivity quandary.Can Duke do the same? One would think so, given that Duke has a history of PRT and an endowment 13 times larger than that of WVU.It is clear that Duke’s bus system in its current form will continue to detract from the Duke experience. After Duke blocked the Durham-Orange Light Rail, the university can be on the right side of history by building PRT. A 15-minute campus is just one decision away.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity sophomore.

Duke cannot be sustainable without you,Anna Garziera,2023-11-08T05:00:00Z,Nov,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110823-garziera-duke-cannot-be-sustainable-without-you-20231108.html,"Although I am not an expert on environmental issues, there are some things that I can identify as mostly “good” or “bad” for the environment just as easily as the next guy. Namely, the misuse of resources (water, food, energy) is generally bad, and the reduction of waste and recycling is good.Last November, Duke announced its Climate Commitment: “A university-wide, impact-oriented initiative to address the climate crisis by creating sustainable and equitable solutions that place society on the path towards a resilient, flourishing, carbon-neutral world.”As I live surrounded by enormous amounts of waste, this claim — as good-hearted as it sounds — is just hard to believe.At some point, all of us have been faced with the classic Shutterstock image of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. At first glance, the plastic island hardly seems real. Looking closer, however, each colorful inch of the island can be identified: a bottle cap, a Coca-Cola bottle, a single-use grocery store bag, a flip-flop.I would be wrong to claim that Duke University is contributing a larger-than-average amount to the garbage patch, or to any garbage mountain in any landfill out there, compared to institutions of a similar size. However, it is just as questionable for us to claim the label “sustainable” as casually as we do.Though nowadays retaining a moderate position on any issue seems to be difficult, I have always considered myself moderately concerned about the environment. I mostly carry my water bottle with me wherever I go, and if I must purchase a plastic one, I recycle it. I bring a reusable bag to the grocery store, but if I forget it, I re-utilize the single-use ones I take home as trash can liners.Even so, seeing thousands of plastic water bottles being given out, half-drank and thrown away immediately during the tailgate of our first home football game shocked me.I’m aware of how few people care about the waste they generate, but I was not expecting to see such misuse of scarce resources from a school that just the year before advertised how “hundreds of first-year students this year signed up for pre-orientation activities focused on the environment, climate change and sustainability.”Looking back, I should not have been shocked in the first place: What I have seen since then, climate-awareness-wise, has been even more worrying. From free swag given out daily at various campus events (yes, daily — you just must find it) to the thousands of compostable food containers given out at the West Union dining hall daily (and to the lack of a facility to actually compost them) to the tons of food waste coming from the Marketplace dining hall alone — which would probably be enough to feed all of Durham’s hungry — there is so much room for improvement.This morning, I woke up to the sound of running water. Once again, two of Southgate’s bathroom taps had been running all night. Students can’t be blamed for this, either: The seals in some of the faucets are long gone, so it is nearly impossible to close them.With the recent concerns about the quantity of water used in the production of meat products, there has been a push by climate-concerned individuals to shift to veganism. It seems to me that though noble in its vision, this lifestyle change should be preceded by a step much less impactful in students’ lives here at Duke. In other words, we should shut the bathroom faucets at night before we resort to becoming vegan in an effort to save the world.I’m no plumber myself, but the leaking taps seem an easy enough fix — possibly just the seals needing replacement. With lawn reconstructions, work order requests and other plumbing issues, there is no question whether the maintenance team has kept itself busy.Even so, after weeks now, one may wonder why the maintenance team still has not been asked to address this issue.The answer? Prioritization. A faucet running day and night is still not perceived as a great waste. The generosity of resources and the feeling of abundance are two great traits of this grand country. The difficult task lies in drawing the line between comfortable living and useless waste.We are big thinkers at Duke and express rightful concerns about the environment by attempting to address big problems with big ideas. Yet, we are sometimes unable to see little things around us which, when compounded, in themselves cause substantial harm.Reading about the university’s progress from its own perspective, it sounds like everything is going as planned. From celebrating “added resources” to new assistant directors to “student passion” to work that is expected to “expand and intensify,” the New Office of Climate and Sustainability mentioned no faults or shortcomings in its Oct. 13 mission statement.However, in talking to other students, it quickly became apparent that I was not the first to question some of Duke’s achievements, in terms of their sustainability. When I think of the university’s efforts towards good environmental practices, the Bleed Blue, Live Green campaign comes to mind. But, from what I’ve seen on campus, it is a little more than a campaign to encourage students to recycle and switch the lights off as they leave a room. Well, that’s underwhelming. Recycling and energy conservation should be a given by now.Whereas the real effects of the Climate Commitment are not yet apparent, I have to acknowledge that a plan of action is there, ready to be implemented.Duke Dining’s Waste Reduction & Recovery strategy, for instance, offers some great ideas for reducing waste. Some of these, such as educating students on their impact and introducing “a reusable takeout container program” would address the issue nicely. As it turns out, students are just as easily influenced by each other: The bandwagon effect would help this program spread quickly on campus. Additionally, I don’t think it would not be tedious to implement. Incentives such as food-point discounts could even be used to incentivize students to bring their reusable containers.Nevertheless, this program has never seen a true attempt at implementation. Then, it is no wonder that with so many similar programs being outlined and never introduced, students and staff alike are starting to feel skeptical towards the grounds upon which the university gave its promises.In a way, I understand that Duke should be expected to be just as unsustainable as any other private institution: in its defense, Duke is only trying to keep to the standard and sell itself to students and parents out there. If the Duke Climate Commitment achieves this, then it was a good move by the marketing team, but mainly that — a marketing strategy.If Duke hadn’t made a Climate Commitment last year, it would have signed its own death contract. There is no business for unsustainable companies in today’s world, after all.This considered, maybe it was my delusion to expect higher-than-average levels of sustainability in a college campus that is rich, influential and holds modern and liberal values about the climate and environment.Despite my feeling uneasy in front of useless waste, I can still only consider myself a moderately concerned student at Duke and should really look to start this quest towards sustainability in my very own dorm room.In this lies a truth that can be hard to admit: the future of the university’s sustainability truly lies in students’ hands. Not just through the formation of new environmental groups (Duke has 35!) or through hopeful messages printed in bold on presentations of new future projects and ideas, but in the daily efforts of its students.Then, if students and faculty are as concerned about the environment as they seem to be, I ask one thing: let's all start to give our contribution through small, deliberate changes. Let’s return to the basics: let’s recycle plastic containers; let’s re-fill our water bottles; let’s only take what we need from the Marketplace buffet. Oh, and please: Someone come to Southgate and fix those leaking faucets.Anna Garziera is a Trinity first-year. Her column typically runs on alternate Wednesdays."
The art of giving up,Valerie Tan,2023-11-08T05:00:00Z,Nov,8,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110823-tan-art-of-giving-up-20231108.html,"Giving up is not in the vocabulary of most Duke students. We complain about having too much on our plates and bemoan the lack of personal time to do the things we truly enjoy, but adamantly keep one foot in every door. We cling tenaciously to commitments that our freshmen selves took on impulsively, no matter how much we’ve come to dread them. Many of us end up shackled to these responsibilities till graduation, having missed the window of opportunity to call it quits. Why do we struggle so much with quitting? Was college not designed to be a sandbox where we can explore our professional aspirations and personal interests without any strings attached? As college students empowered by newfound autonomy yet still free from adult responsibilities, should we not be savoring this golden period of self-discovery?The thing is, expectations — from ourselves and others — have a way of keeping us fettered to our initial trajectories. Some of us marched into college with ambitious goals and detailed four-year action plans, only to realize that they do not align with our interests. But even with the freedom to switch paths at our fingertips, we hesitate to exercise it, repulsed by the thought of putting all the time and effort we’ve already invested to waste. After all, without any guarantee that the alternative would be any better, we risk making the wrong call and begetting a lifetime of regret. Some of us feel obligated to let our personal enjoyment take a backseat to practical motivations. We persist in academic or professional pursuits that don’t necessarily bring us joy, all in the name of bolstering our portfolio game. Presented with a plethora of opportunities but a scarcity of time, we feel pressured to participate in as many activities as possible to maximize our experiences, even if it means spreading ourselves thin to the point of burnout.The fear of failure is, of course, another major deterrent. At a private college like Duke, where everyone seems to have mastered their own delicate balancing acts, giving up feels akin to admitting defeat. As much as we might casually flirt with the idea of quitting or boldly declare our intentions to throw in the towel, few actually summon the courage to act on that resolve. It is a mark of dishonor for us overachievers, a blemish on our immaculate records that will haunt us for the rest of our lives. It does not help that most of us were accepted to Duke for specific niches that we’ve spent a lifetime carving out, be it athletic prowess, artistic talent or academic flair. These skills have become so integral to our identities that losing them would be tantamount to losing a part of ourselves. Thus, gritting our teeth through the dreary repetition, we devote hours of practice to honing and maintaining them at the expense of time for other pursuits.As a perfectionist, I too struggle with quitting. Mustering the courage to call it quits is difficult enough, but finding the right timing is even more so. Whenever I feel the urge to give up arise within me, I entertain it briefly before brushing it off as temporary disillusionment and reassuring myself that things will get better as long as I persevere long enough. But how long is long enough?After two years of college, I’ve learned that giving up is a skill that comes with a lot of practice and experience. But I’ve also learned to trust my instincts more. There might have been instances when I quit prematurely, failing to hold out long enough to experience personal growth or witness improvements in the circumstances. But more often than not, once the situation regressed to the point where the thought of giving up even occurred to me, quitting turned out to be the right choice. In hindsight, I’ve only regretted not quitting sooner. Living in adamant denial and with baseless optimism kept me unhappily bound to a few too many commitments that I should have abandoned a long time ago. As we go through our annual routine of piling our plates with extracurricular and academic involvements, let us not be bogged down with the weight of previous affiliations and hefty expectations or disheartened by the fear of humiliation and uncertainty. Four years are too short to be spent suffering through experiences that are seemingly beneficial or obligatory, at the expense of those that truly delight us.Valerie Tanis a Pratt junior.

Human rights and campus climate statement on Gaza and Israel,"Robin Kirk, James Chappel, Erika Weinthal, Rebecca Stein, Mona Hassan, Nancy MacLean",2023-11-07T21:32:00Z,Nov,7,Letters To The Editor,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110723-kirk-weinthal-human-rights-israel-gaza-statement-20231107.html,"We join human rights and civil society organizations across the globe in calling for the immediate, safe and sufficient provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the release of all hostages. We mourn all civilians harmed by the war between Israel and Hamas and join others in calling on the Israeli government and Hamas leadership to cease further actions that harm Palestinian and Israeli civilians. International humanitarian law (IHL) forbids the deliberate targeting of civilians, indiscriminate attacks, the use of civilians as human shields and the imposition of collective punishment. IHL also demands the protection of medical personnel and civilian objects, including water installations and electricity — all of which have been targeted in the current war.We join with our human rights partners and civil society organizations in the region and beyond in calling for humanitarian principles to guide all actions and the immediate cessation of all indiscriminate attacks and attacks that target civilians or employ disproportionate lethal force against them. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that our campus remains a safe place for our community to discuss and learn without fear. Universities should be places where hard questions can be posed and debated. Any conflict with such ghastly human cost compels us to educate ourselves about the history, engage in civil discussion, help craft solutions and above all speak out to protect human life. On campus, we must listen to one another with sympathy and respect and speak out on behalf of our fellow human beings.We affirm the right of all people to live safely, free from violence and oppression. We are steadfast in our support, empathy and care for members of our university and local communities who have suffered loss, are fearful or worry that they cannot freely voice their opinions or concerns.

Lest we forget,Luke A. Powery,2023-11-06T05:00:00Z,Nov,6,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110623-powery-lest-we-forget-20231106.html,"This is a season of remembrance in various traditions with days for Día de los Muertos, All Hallows, All Souls and All Saints. It makes sense to me to celebrate memory because it is so essential for our lives. We rely on memory for many things — how to find our way back home, where our offices are, where we parked our cars (this can be a challenging one!), our phone numbers, our birth dates and birthplaces and where we were during historic, tragic or joyful moments.We can take memory for granted because it is so automatic and unconscious for many of us, but if you examine it closely, you’ll notice that there are different kinds of memory: working memory that’s used to store information for short periods; episodic memory to recall past events; semantic memory to remember the meanings of words, facts, faces or objects; prospective memory to remember an appointment, date or event in the future; procedural memory that involves actions you learn and can do automatically, like tying shoelaces; and even musical memory that is often still present for those who otherwise struggle with remembering.I’d like to add one more mode of memory to that list: remembering one another as fellow human beings. I say that both in the sense of remembering the infinite value of the life of another person but also in the sense of repairing broken relationships near and far — that is, “remembering” people and bonds that have been dismembered by violence, hatred or indifference.Some know that I have a kind of memorial to this type of remembering on my office desk in Duke Chapel. Sitting side-by-side, I have a communion cup and plate from Tabgha on the Sea of Galilee to remember Jesus who was crucified, and next to them a can of Arizona Iced Tea and a packet of Skittles to remember Trayvon Martin who was murdered in Sanford, Florida in 2012. When I look at these elements, I hear a faint whisper: “Remember.”This type of memory is at play in my scholarship and teaching on the Spirituals. These are songs — first passed on by memory — that were created by people whose names have been forgotten. I think of the Spirituals as musical memorabilia created on the anvil of misery that was inhumane slavery.Last spring semester, I taught a course on the Spirituals as a resource for preaching in a federal men’s prison. There were 10 Divinity School students and 12 incarcerated students in my class. There were many memorable moments from that class, but one that stands out was when one of the incarcerated students preached a memorial sermon for a former friend and inmate who died during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the class reflection time after the sermon, the student-preacher talked about the importance of remembering, even if it wasn’t for a memorial sermon per se. The irony, I learned, was that this incarcerated student-preacher was suffering from memory loss all semester. The one losing his memory was exhorting us not to lose ours and to remember one another. It might be easy to forget those in prison who are out of sight and perhaps out of mind. But the forgotten ones are the wise ones who remind us — “don’t forget.”As this student talked, I looked across the room and saw something that could have been a coincidence — or a providential message. Against the wall, I noticed that a table with “in remembrance of me” was covered up with mops and yellow caution signs, so you couldn’t read the entirety of this phrase spoken by Jesus. Here in this prison was that same whisper as at my office desk: “Remember.”So, in this fall season of nostalgia and memory, I want to ask you: Who do you remember and who do you forget? And in this time in the world of strife and broken bodies, I want to ask you: Will you remember with me?The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel.

The constant 'renovations' on Abele Quad are counterproductive,Zubin Rekhi,2023-11-03T11:10:00Z,Nov,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110323-rekhi-abele-quad-administration-studentlife-20231103.html,"If you've been asking yourself when construction and maintenance work is going to end on West Campus, it’s completely understandable. In my first two months on campus as a transfer student, I’ve had to learn and then relearn the ways to my classes not once but at least half a dozen times. I’ve become exhausted from attempting to find new foolproof ways to classes, the library, WU and the bus stop. I’ve even gotten lost in the Divinity School while finding a detour for traveling between my statistics class at the Levine Science Research Center and the library because the path I normally take through the breezeway was closed.But my point in this article is not to complain about incessant repairs inconveniencing students. It is, instead, to argue that by prioritizing looks over function to the cost of students, the Duke administration’s repairs are counterproductive to achieving the goal of actually revitalizing Abele Quad as the heart of campus. Students need more places to hang out, not a fresh coat of fenced-off grass in Abele Quad.The administration’s selfishness explains why the university’s vanity project takes precedence over fulfilling basic improvements to student life. It enables us to understand why tearing up a perfectly good plot of grass only to mulch and replant it again is higher up on the university’s priorities than increasing outdoor seating and benches on Abele Quad to actually bring students together. Student interest is irrelevant: here, what matters is optimizing picture frames for more clicks on a Duke website and impressing tour groups.After reading through the list of projects planned for Duke’s Centennial, ]it becomes obvious that most “improvements” aren’t designed to improve student life; they serve purely aesthetic functions and provide no utility to students. And by polishing Abele further, the university makes it more unlikely that students will consider it a warm, communal space where they can spend time with their friends. The long-term projects that the university has invested in fulfilling include replacing bluestone walkways along Abele Quad and limestone steps to the Chapel, repaving the Chapel Drive bus circle, replacing concrete curbs with granite curbs on Chapel Drive, replacing the Chapel’s stained glass, strengthening the limestone arches along the breezeways, and repaving the tennis courts. The university also engages in constant landscape upkeep requiring planting, reseeding and repeatedly mowing plots of grass. One wonders how many other projects directly addressing student needs the university could fulfill with the same funding instead of maintaining a laundry list of aesthetic improvements.One also wonders whether these projects are worth inconveniencing students, faculty members, and campus visitors who just want to get from one point to another with as little trouble as possible. Replacing concrete curbs with granite ones is not at the top of any faculty member’s, visitor’s or student’s concerns. But having dust blown on their faces — from cut limestone and pulverized asphalt — and being late to commitments — from inconsistent access to walkways on West Campus — is surely on their list of irritations.The tragedy is that while Duke’s administration squanders money by chiseling away at the edge of pavements, many small improvements — actually capable of strengthening a sense of community among students and improving student life — go completely overlooked. Lawn chairs, more benches, volleyball nets and hammocks could all bring the West Campus community together cost-effectively. It would be nice to see more students having picnics on Abele Quad and fewer stone walkways and perfectly manicured grass.This is especially true because Abele, with its location at the center of campus, could actually contribute so much to student life. Currently, most students probably spend little time in and around Abele. BC Plaza is where students hang out in an outdoor space and where clubs hold tabling. WU and Pitchforks are where students eat, study, and discuss their days with their friends indoors. Perkins Library is where students hold study sessions. Considering that the administration justifies the repairs by calling Abele Quad the “heart of campus,” I find it ironic that I’d consider the outdoor quad to be one of the most dead places on campus. Turning Abele into the campus’s actual “heart” by installing outdoor seating and creating open spaces for students to picnic and discuss their days with their friends under sunlight would be the best renovation Duke could make to its campus. But clogging up the arteries used to access Abele and scattering fencing, industrial cranes and concrete only makes Abele even more useless to students.I implore Duke’s administration to actually make good on its promise of revitalizing the “heart” of campus not by chiseling away at concrete curbs but by actually adding amenities that students would use on Abele.Zubin Rekhi is a Trinity sophomore.

Naps in Neverland: Three things I’ll miss about Duke in the working world ,Jessica Luan,2023-11-03T11:04:00Z,Nov,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110323-luan-missing-duke-20231103.html,"When I was a freshman, I thought that being a working adult would be paradise. Corporate America would mean the absence of my biggest Duke gripes: midterm exams, big egos and suspiciously soggy $5 cantaloupe. Never again would I spend $10 on 10 grams of salmon or sob over a silly school assignment. I would get paid for opening my laptop. What could be better?Of course, you don’t get paid just to open your laptop. You get paid to work. Certainly, work freed me from exams and presentations. But it also restricted the freedoms I had taken for granted at Duke, which I hope to cherish in my last year here. Office coffees replaced my afternoon naps. Before, I could barely drink tea without getting jittery. By August, three cups wasn’t enough to kill my caffeine migraine.I spent a lot more time indoors than I expected. I didn’t realize I might even miss the glass paneling at WU, which makes my food look a lot more appetizing than fluorescent office lights do. On the flip side, the complete lack of UV exposure during my waking hours had a silver lining: My skin looked fantastic. When my summer ended, I realized I should have cherished my college experience a lot sooner because of its flexibility, its friendships and its fleetingness. I sometimes thought Duke was a dungeon, but I should have realized it is Neverland. At school, we can wear whatever we want. Neither foot-friendly Crocs, nor fashionable Birkenstock clogs, nor questionable “white” sneakers will violate any official or unofficial dress code. Even running errands like grabbing an afternoon snack, picking up packages or doing cardio likely means running into a friendly face. As an adult, I don’t think I’ll ever run into several friends at a coffee shop randomly on a Tuesday. If I must cry, it’ll be over FaceTime instead of face-to-face at a booth in the BC McDonald's. I will have more financial freedom and more mobility, but I’ll also have fewer opportunities to experience the best and worst parts of adulthood with so many people.I do think this romanticizing has gone too far. Even the Farmstead salmon presents in my imagined Gothic Wonderland. But in my defense, microwaving fish or other strong-smelling foods in the office is bad kitchen etiquette. When else do I have the privilege of eating fish for lunch? Similarly, I would much rather eat fresh-cooked food from WU every day than alternate between reheated Trader Joe’s frozen meals and girl dinners, which I did some weeks this summer. To be fair, Duke is not perfect, and all these benefits are far from free. Tuition costs more than $60,000 a year, and salmon and two sides costs more than $17 after tax. Sheesh. But for these four short years, we have freedom to learn about our majors, about other people and ourselves. We can discuss world cinema by day and design algorithms by night. We can walk to our friends’ residences instead of driving or flying to another city during holidays. I’m still not the biggest fan of midterms, late nights or academically stressful times. However, I’m not their biggest hater either. Soon, I won’t even have the opportunity to hate on them. I’m not sure what my 20s will look like, but I do feel certain that my corporate office building won’t look as cool as Rubenstein, and the nap pod (if there is one) won’t feel as comfortable as the Oasis’ yoga mat. With this in mind, I hope to treasure each remaining moment of my Duke experience. Jessica Luan is a Trinity senior. Her column typically runs on alternate Fridays."
The legacy of the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory,Nik Narain,2023-11-03T04:00:00Z,Nov,3,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110323-narain-duke-parapsychology-labratory-legacy-20231103.html,"Most people don’t know that barely a mile off campus, there’s an entire research institute dedicated to parapsychology (PSI) — the study of psychic and paranormal phenomena. Indeed, the Rhine Research Center, often just called “the Rhine,” is an independent, nonprofit center that seeks to explore the frontiers of human consciousness through unexplained experiences, such as clairvoyance, telepathy, psychokinesis and near-death experiences.The Rhine is named after its founder Joseph Banks Rhine, the third most popular J.B. on campus after J.B. Duke and J.B.’s Roast and Chops. J.B. and his wife Louisa Rhine originally studied to become a botanist until 1922, when the two listened to a lecture about psychical research and spiritualism given by none other than the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Four years later, they terminated their botany careers and moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where J.B. began to study under William McDougall, a parapsychology pioneer and notable anti-behaviorist, which was apparently scandalous at the time. McDougall invited Rhine to work with him in his new role as lead psychologist at a recently endowed school called Duke University. The Rhines followed MacDougall, and J.B. was promoted to assistant teaching professor in 1928 before becoming fully tenured in 1937. Rhine would go on to establish himself as the unofficial leader of parapsychology as a psychological science. While studying in Cambridge, he notoriously defamed the popular medium Mina “Margery” Crandon, reporting fraud during one of her seances. At Duke, Rhine and MacDougall founded the Parapsychology Laboratory, the second parapsychology lab in the world and the first-ever psychology lab at Duke. Among several projects, Rhine famously coined the term “extrasensory perception” (ESP) — the paranormal “sixth sense” ability to detect information not perceived by human senses, and developed a novel ESP screening test using Zener cards. These cards, designed by Duke psychologist Karl Zener, featured various shape designs that participants — often Duke students — would have to guess from the other side of the card. Rhine ran millions of trials over the course of his career manipulating various environmental conditions (i.e. having participants stand up to 250 yards away to guess the card) and concluded the presence of ESP in some of his subjects. He published many of his results in the Journal of Parapsychology, which he founded in 1937.In parallel, Louisa Rhine worked to establish the Durham Nursery School, the first nursery created for children of working women, and the Durham chapter of the League of Women Voters, in addition to decades of research analyzing case studies of psychic experiences. Of course, when it’s your life’s work to bring a scientific framework to inherently “nonsensical” phenomena, you’re inevitably going to get some haters. Many critics point to factors other than ESP to account for the significant results in his experiments, such as cheating by the subjects, sloppiness by the experimenters or machine bias. Rhine’s work has never been replicated, and because the nature of PSI phenomena are inherently unreplicable, most brush off parapsychology as mere pseudoscience. Arguably the most shocking retribution Rhine faced was actually in response to Mina Crandon’s defamation as a medium earlier in his career, where Sir Arthur Conan Doyle criticized Rhine for his “colossal impertinence” and simply called him “a monumental ass.” And that’s why you shouldn’t meet your heroes. Nevertheless, the claim of parapsychology as pseudoscience has been paradoxically refuted by meta-analyses. One analysis looked at 309 precognition studies, conducted by 62 experimenters published in the Journal of Parapsychology between 1935 and 1987. The cumulative probability associated with the overall results was p = 10-24 ( equivalent to .000000000000000000000001, where .05 is considered statistically significant). Other analyses support the idea that alleged experimental design errors alone cannot account for the uniqueness of parapsychology experimental results. People stereotype parapsychologists as psychics, bigfoot hunters, ghostbusters or UFO chasers (myself formerly included) when parapsychology is not about any of these things. I think most people (myself currently included) become interested in psychological research because of its prospect of tackling intense emotional experiences with logic and reasoning to not only better understand the fascinating mysteries of the human mind, but potentially validate deeply personal situations often met with derision. One CBS survey from 2002 reported that 57% of respondents believe in psychic phenomena such as ESP or telekinesis, and 16% claim to have had a psychic experience. 10 to 20% of those who go into cardiac arrest will have a near-death experience. And one in five Americans have seen a psychic. While it’s still up in the air as to whether paranormal experiences are more than just science fiction, the persistent attempt to empirically determine its existence and create space for its academic discourse and criticism cannot be dismissed as pseudoscience.Today, parapsychology exists as something of a niche subculture for those dually interested in the intersection between science and spirituality, attracting those with backgrounds in anything from shamanism to statistics to fiction — with Rhine’s work being cited as a major source of inspiration for writers such as John W. Campbell and Shirley Jackson, the creator of The Haunting of Hill House. The Rhine, still today’s leading parapsychology institute, continues to build upon the work of its founder, with Rhine’s daughter Sally Rhine Feather still serving on its Board of Directors. The Rhine additionally offers parapsychology education courses and community engagement opportunities, including an “Ask a Parapsychologist” blog for online myth-busting. Anyone can join the Rhine community or participate in a study if you find yourself particularly psychokinetic these days.

In defense of the pick-me girl,Advikaa Anand,2023-11-02T04:00:00Z,Nov,2,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110223-anand-pick-me-girl-defense-20231102.html,"As we computed the areas of scalene and obtuse triangles, my ninth-grade geometry group was discussing the latest updates in the football recruiting process for our town’s seniors. One boy remarked on the particularly impressive abilities of a graduating senior in the school across town. “Nick Saban and Dabo Swinney are here to see him,” he shared with his friend sitting next to him, furiously shading in the area of a triangle. “You mean the coaches of Alabama and Clemson?” I asked, looking up from my work. “Wow, that’s huge.”Both boys stared back at me, their mouths agape. Surely, their athletically challenged, school-loving classmate knew nothing about football. But it was their response that was even more jarring.“Wow, Advikaa,” one said, still bewildered. “I respect you so much more now.”The implication of his extremely problematic statement was clear: I was only worthy of his respect if I displayed qualities that were contrary to a typical feminine identity; instead, I was more admirable if I was unexpectedly masculine — an emblem of the “not like other girls” trope so popularized in media today. A new TikTok trend strives to capture exactly this frustration, mocking those girls who try to monopolize masculine attention by distinguishing themselves from other girls through a disdain for “girly” activities, such as wearing make-up, dressing up in flattering clothing or even consuming “feminine” foods — like a salad — instead of devouring a more greasy pizza — nicknamed the “pick-me” girl. At first glance, this trend may seem like a defense of women and their display of “traditionally” feminine characteristics. With a closer look, however, it is clear that it is underpinned by the same internalized misogyny that characterizes the pick-me girl. Of course, the pick-me is problematic — while pointing out how they are unique and therefore desirable, such girls often diminish other women and their self-worth. But nor is the anti-pick-me the feminist undoing of this archetype. Instead, this attempt to deconstruct a byproduct of patriarchal societal values has created its own Frankenstein monster, enabling facile criticisms of women for any behavior seen as excessive – being too annoying, too attention-seeking, just too much. As Dr. Christina Riley, professor of critical race theory, gender, and critical race studies at American University, explains, the ubiquitous presence of these skits on TV enables “everyone to add something to the list of grievances pitted against this figure, to the point where literally anything could qualify someone as a Pick-Me girl.” Ultimately, this trend further perpetuates the sexism it so vehemently strives to decry, “broaden[ing] the terms for women-bashing.”Moreover, the anti-pick-me’s further exacerbate the gender binary that feminist activism has tried so hard to eradicate. Their overarching message is clear: Women can either be the feminine good or the masculine evil. Any girl who veers towards shedding her femininity by participating excessively in traditionally “male” activities does so on purpose and only for attention.Yet, such an assumption completely fails to recognize that most women — and most humans — display a combination of traits that, collectively, are androgynous — neither typically feminine nor masculine. The trend reiterates the long-discredited fact that some activities are only for men and others only for women. It automatically assumes that any girl indulging in the former must be doing so for attention because clearly, a woman has no business more pressing than winning the attention, and ultimately, the affection of a man. As Madeleine Webster, an avid social media consumer, puts it, “I’m always suspicious of a trend that blames women for sexism.”While calling out pick-me behavior, we must acknowledge its predication on patriarchal expectations of female behavior, instead of overindulging in the systematic embarrassment and insult of those who display these tendencies. Often, such behavior results from an intrinsic need to feel better about one’s self and “to survive bullying, high school and cultural expectations.”Although this behavior is harmful, it is equally harmful — not to mention reductive — to ascribe all female behavior that stands out as an attempt to win male attention. After all, how ironic is it that these self-proclaimed anti-pick-mes are themselves functioning on the same assumption that they see as so flawed within their pick-me counterparts?Instead, as women, we must endeavor to genuinely have each other’s back, not criticizing other girls for being too outwardly “masculine” or “feminine” but instead encouraging them to be themselves — whatever androgynous shape that might assume. Human behavior is fluid and a product of circumstances, sometimes taking the form of extremes on the gender binary. And that’s okay. It’s natural. It’s real. Assuming an attention-seeking motive behind female behavior diminishes women’s humanity and the gravity of experiences that converge to make us who we are. Maybe that girl who you think wears the flashy blue football jersey to fit in with the guys actually dons it as a reminder of her father, who lives hundreds of miles away and sees her only once a year. Maybe that girl who wears bright red lipstick every time you see her does so as a token of her late mother, who loved red roses. Women — like all humans — have stories, and the vast variations of their behavior cannot be confined by a singular, linear narrative.Women already excessively apologize because they fear they are too much — too needy, too imposing, too woman. They don’t need to also say sorry because another woman doesn’t think they are woman enough.To the anti-pick-mes: Woman up.Advikaa Anand is a Trinity sophomore.

History’s role in race-based affirmative action,Sonia Green,2023-11-01T04:00:00Z,Nov,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/103123-green-history-affirmative-action-20231101.html,"With the striking down of affirmative action over the summer, I had assumed the debate was over. Conservatives won, and Black students — as we often are — were left to grapple with what this new legislation would mean. We came back to Duke and many students moved on with their lives as if nothing had happened. I was hesitant, however. I didn’t know what this meant for my community and as I navigated campus, I constantly wondered who was on “our side."" It turns out that this debate on affirmative action is bigger than I could have ever imagined even though the concept is quite simple. Affirmative action policies aim to achieve and maintain racial diversity in higher education and give opportunities to a diverse group of people. What exactly is wrong with that? The era of segregation was not that long ago, and barring Black Americans from schools like Duke did not depend on class but race.I must preface by stating that while affirmative action policies serve Black, Latinx and Native American students, I will be focusing on their impact on the Black community, as that is the one I am a part of. The affirmative action debate boils down to the question: Is it ethical to give some marginalized communities an advantage even if it seemingly disadvantages other groups? I argue yes. To understand why, it’s important to look at history. The United States was built by Black people who were provided little to no compensation for their labor. Even after slavery and segregation were legally overturned, Black Americans were still not provided the same access to the institutions their labor had built. This is at the heart of the affirmative action issue. While Black Americans were subjected to de facto segregated schools with lower-quality resources and almost no access to college or higher education — especially at elite institutions like Duke — white Americans went to better schools and colleges. They built wealth and gained knowledge which they passed to their offspring. In order to really understand affirmative action, one must understand the communities it serves to uplift. Students of color coming from lower-income and under resourced communities are more likely to fare worse on metrics that colleges use to evaluate applicants. These resources vary greatly among racial lines, especially considering that the poverty rate for Black Americans — at 17.1% — is double the the poverty rate for Asian and white Americans, the latter at 8.6%. Income alone cannot replace race in admissions criteria as long as this racial wealth gap — caused and upheld by a history of structural racism — exists. I’d like to point out real-life examples of instances in which affirmative action has “worked”. Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr., historian and professor at Harvard University, states that without affirmative action, he would not have gone to Yale University, his alma mater. This was clearly not due to a lack of academic ability; Dr. Gates is now a revered figure in academia and the documentary world. He said this because without affirmative action he would have never had the opportunity.Even Clarence Thomas, one of the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn affirmative action, is also believed to have benefitted from this practice. These two figures have, regardless of their politics, gone on to create successful careers that they simply may not have had access to without these affirmative action policies in the 1960s and 1970s. These same policies are still relevant today, only a few decades later.Now, people argue that race-based affirmative action is no longer necessary because adding value to race sets us back. I wholeheartedly disagree and argue that this thinking comes from a point of privilege. Elite colleges and universities have a history of race-based exclusion, and this legacy can still be seen today. Take Duke as an example: White and Asian students make up over half of the population on campus while Black students only make up about 7%. Whenever I walk around campus, it is easy to spot a student who is white or Asian, but I am struck by how many times I have been places and struggled to see another Black peer. This has happened on the C1, in classes, in WU and in many other spaces. Additionally, many white students and Asian students are familiar and/or comfortable with interacting with each other in a way that they are not with Black students. There is no reason why students should be scared of me when I ask them to respect quiet hours while in a common area or act uncomfortable when they are told they cannot use the occupied Black Student Alliance (BSA) office to join a private Zoom meeting. Black students are constantly seen as a group to be feared or a spectacle to be carefully observed on campus because for many Duke students, this is their first real interaction with Black people. How should we feel?To those who are still not convinced that we need race-based affirmative action, I challenge you to think about how many people in your family attended Duke or a similar institution. What about your high school? What about your community? I have often noticed that the students who are most upset by race-based affirmative action already have a lot of exposure to elite institutions. Race-based affirmative action is the only remedy to a historically inequitable system. Arguing that race-based affirmative action is no longer needed is like arguing that we can right the wrongs of an entire racist system in just a few generations. It’s naive at best and that is not something we can afford to be.Sonia Green is a Trinity junior. Her column typically runs on alternate Tuesdays. "
The philosopher-therapist is in and they will see you now,Jess Jiang,2023-11-01T04:00:00Z,Nov,1,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/110123-jiang-philosopher-therapist-20231101.html,"The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, in his great work ""Philosophical Investigations,"" describes himself as doing therapeutic work and views philosophy itself as a form of therapy. I know — it sounds whack. Can you imagine stepping into a therapy room for a first meeting and finding a philosopher instead:“I’ve been feeling sad for a while now, and I had a really bad argument with my friend yesterday.” “Well, how do you know your friend exists as another person independent of your mind? Exactly. You don’t. And for that matter, how do you know you’re feeling sad? What exactly, conscious or unconscious, causes sadness?”Thankfully, what Wittgenstein means by the statement “philosophy is therapy” is not this kind of interaction. Instead, Wittgenstein’s point is that philosophy often tries to abstract and generalize ideas, when instead philosophers should point out the logical fallacies and pitfalls that we make when constructing universal philosophical theories. Philosophers, Wittgenstein criticizes, like a true gadfly of the 2,600-year-long behemoth of Western philosophy, are using language wrong.Philosophers have traditionally thought of words — “love,” “truth,” “sandwiches” — as having one abstract, ultimate meaning. But Wittgenstein argues that such a universal definition for a word doesn’t make sense in the majority of cases where we’re concerned about meaning. A word’s meaning isn’t understood through an abstract definition. Instead, we understand a word’s meaning by using it — in conversations, emails, and other communication. Words are tools. Just like a tool is defined by what it is used for, words are defined by their observed effect on other people and resulting changes from these people in the environment. That is, words don’t have to mean anything in and of themselves: They don’t have to conjure up a mental picture or reduce to some essential definition. Instead, we use words much like how we use game pieces, in a sort of language game we learn by observation.Why is this distinction of language such a big deal to Wittgenstein? Wittgenstein’s argument is that traditional philosophy is, like the sciences, interested in finding universal, conceptual truths. However, philosophy, unlike the sciences, doesn’t concern itself much with experiments: experiments aren’t well-suited for answering conceptual questions. Conceptual truths are rarely as simple as numerical relationships, nor do they fit into universal theories the way that scientific truths about the physical world do. Philosophy, unlike science, is not empirical, because it deals with conceptual matters. Our concepts — about justice or beauty, for example — developed in order to help us interact with our particular environment and milieu. They are not easily collapsible into one meaning. Instead, their meanings vary from person to person and situation to situation. The danger in philosophy, according to Wittgenstein, is to assume that each word has one and only one meaning. Because of this tendency, philosophy is prone to overgeneralizing, overextending analogies, and dismissing uncommon but significant exceptions to the rule. The way we define and understand language is important because it leads us to think we can generalize philosophical conclusions, like in science, when actually we can’t.The right philosophical approach, according to Wittgenstein, is not to construct theories but rather to simply describe what is going on. Instead of assuming a hidden, universal and thus erroneous truth about a concept, philosophers should limit themselves to describing what is known without extrapolation and identifying mistaken assumptions in existing theories.And upon first reading about Wittgenstein’s dismissive view of philosophy, I found myself agreeing. I’ve often thought that philosophy has a lot in common with science fiction. Both ask “what if?” and then elaborate on the consequences of their first assumptions. But unlike science fiction, philosophy is meant to describe the world as it is. I dislike reading philosophy where the basic premises seem so unscientific that I struggle to take the argument seriously.But I don’t mean to imply that Wittgenstein’s philosophy is faultless. In fact, I think he’s frustrating in his own way too: his view of philosophy includes no explanation, no right answer — only description. Just as a therapist doesn’t usually ask what exactly, conscious or unconscious, caused a patient to feel sad or delve into hypotheticals irrelevant to the current situation, Wittgenstein doesn’t concern himself with asking why or what if. It seems as if he can’t be bothered to look for answers to philosophical questions, as imperfect as these answers may be.This is frustrating, I’ll bet, to anyone who is even a little curious. In general, I like knowing the right answer. I like knowing the right way to cheer up someone who’s feeling down, knowing the right way to solve a homework problem and knowing the right way to live my life. But, despite what philosophical faults Wittgenstein’s theory raises, I’m grudgingly realizing that his emphasis on individual experiences instead of abstract, universal truths does have some merit in my own life. In fact, so much of human relationships depend on experience: concepts like happiness, sadness, love and grief gain a new dimension of meaning when you experience them for the first time. This is where science falls flat, and where art — in its experiential peculiarity — shines.For example, I have found what I consider the perfect way to cheer someone up not through analysis of human psychology, but by living abroad for a semester, talking to people face-to-face after COVID-19, and waiting for grief for a family member to lessen. It’s not that I’ve gained much strategic knowledge about how to talk people through their woes, though that certainly is needed. Instead, I feel more comfortable asking questions and being myself. What is this, if not the result of lived experience?The meaning of life, too, seems to depend on lived experience. The meaning of life, for me, is inseparable from the idea of a legacy, and my idea of legacy, for better or worse, is likewise inseparable from the Broadway musical Hamilton. “What is a legacy?” asks the titular Alexander Hamilton. “It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.”But maybe a legacy doesn’t have to be a grand new creation. Perhaps a legacy is watering seeds into trees over the course of a life, or introducing another to the joys of gardening. Perhaps a legacy is not one impressive accomplishment, but the ordinary things that are easy to overlook—like humor, walking someone who’s lost to their destination, or picking up litter where no one else does.Maybe once I’m out of school, past the stress of graduate school applications and job interviews, I’ll stop worrying entirely about the perfect responses to test questions and what I think other people think my goal in life should be. I’d like to read more poetry, make some sort of positive contribution to my community and succeed at least once in composing a song that actually sounds good. Perhaps I’ll even get around to reading Wittgenstein’s “Philosophical Investigations.”In the meantime, I’ll water my succulents. Does that count as therapy? I’d say yes, but that’s just my definition.Jess Jiang is a Trinity senior. Their column typically runs on alternate Wednesdays."
Your classes suck. It’s tenure’s fault,Aaron Price,2023-10-31T04:00:00Z,Oct,31,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/103123-price-tenure-20231031.html,"As it happens with every computer science recitation section during class bookbagging, the focus of the meeting shifted from the assigned worksheet to course recommendations for the next semester. Eager underclassmen peppered the TAs and seniors with questions as they searched for courses that would be valuable for them — “valuable” being defined as either fascinating, pre-professionally helpful or easy. One student started, “I’m really into artificial intelligence. What are your thoughts on those classes?”The TA responded, “Outdated.”Another sophomore jumped in, “What about this class? I’ve heard it’s helpful for internships?”A senior butted in, “Good class but the professor is a jerk.”This went on and on until I finally quipped in with the advice, “If you really want to prep for industry, don’t take any computer science classes and just work on your own side projects instead.”Wow. Duke charges $60,000 a year for tuition and that’s the advice I gave to underclassmen? How did we get here and why isn’t undergraduate teaching being valued?Here’s the thing: this is not the fault of the individual professors as much as a systemic issue with incentives in higher education, specifically with tenure. Academic tenure is one of the most coveted promotions in academia. Originally conceived as a means to safeguard academic freedom, its true main perk is becoming almost unfireable. As such, for most professors, this job security is a highly attractive goal.Tenure, according to the Duke Faculty Handbook, ""should be reserved for those who have clearly demonstrated excellence in scholarship, and whose work has been widely perceived among their peers as outstanding.”Ok. “Work” could mean teaching.It continues: “Good teaching/mentoring and university/professional service should be expected but cannot in and of themselves be sufficient grounds for tenure. Sustained scholarly output is required for tenure.”After chatting with Duke administrators and professors striving for tenure, I learned that the expectation of “good teaching” is barely — if at all — considered compared to research output. If professors earn promotions and recognition based on their research, their neglect for teaching starts to make sense.One professor told me just a few days ago that she doesn’t meet with students to chat about her class or their academic goals. Why would she? Teaching doesn’t matter.Or the computer science classes only teaching concepts from the 1980’s? Why update them? It doesn’t matter.Now, I don’t think professors hate teaching or aren’t trying to serve their students. When I relay the “professor refusing to meet with me” story to other Duke educators, they give a sour face. But, after chatting with a computer science professor about lecture creation, I began to understand the main reason for professor’s widespread prioritization of research over their undergraduate classes. He told me it’s common knowledge in academia that one hour of lecture takes eight hours to put together. So, he says, most professors write their curriculum once and never change it. Because if they did, over the course of a 15-week semester, a professor lecturing twice a week for an hour and 15 minutes would spend 300 hours building a new curriculum. That’s a lot of hours that could be spent on research instead.And this is putting faculty in a tough spot. One professor in the humanities said he is thinking about leaving Duke because the administration keeps pushing him to publish but he wants to focus on teaching. He’s an incredibly loved professor by students but he needs tenure in order to feel like he can safely be there for his family. His focus on teaching is threatening his ability to support his children.So here’s my idea: What if we gave professors a tenure-like perk for outstanding teaching? Incentives would be flipped for professors who love to teach and suddenly there would be a much higher emphasis on relevant and outstanding undergraduate classes.Let’s recognize as a university and in the broader higher education sector that undergraduates should be deriving value from their classes. We are asked to pay $60,000 a year for it. At the very least, Duke should incentivize professors to care.Aaron Price is a Trinity senior. His column typically runs on alternate Tuesdays. "
QuadEx may not be a bad idea,Angikar Ghosal,2023-10-30T04:00:00Z,Oct,30,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/103023-ghosal-quadex-not-a-bad-idea-20231030.html,"Readers of The Chronicle know that one of the shibboleth passwords for easier entry to the echo chamber of Duke’s campus culture is the phrase ""QuadEx is terrible."" Hence, I attempt to assail the ramparts of prevailing sentiment with the contrarian call that QuadEx may not be a bad idea. On their own, all symbols — whether they are elaborate emblems, letters of the Greek alphabet, initiation rituals or Latin mottos — are social constructs, lacking any intrinsic authenticity. Yet these vestiges of affiliation — be they of a business fraternity, a social fraternity or Duke as a whole — are valuable to the members. The symbols are significant to individuals precisely because of their association with the communal entities. As a postmodernist would say, “Chants are not chanted in a group because they are holy; they become holy because they are chanted in a group.” Hence, the administrators at Duke have decided: There is no reason accessibility to symbolism is restrictive!Two prospective trajectories unfold from here. In the first scenario, high school graduates in the year 2041 write their ""Why Duke"" essays, expounding upon the hackneyed observation that the “distinctive character of the collegiate-style accommodations nurtures a sense of camaraderie and exudes the ethos ‘work hard, play hard.’” In this scenario, each quad shall have invariably acquired an aura of a distinct adjective, although the exact matching of these particular qualities to these quads is still to be determined. Did you not know that, “___ quad is where the gym bros live,” and, “____ quad is where people are always studying,” and, “____ quad never sleeps”? This is, frankly, the ideal, optimistic scenario. The other scenario is that QuadEx stays an enduring fixture of campus life, albeit without students heavily identifying with their quads. I assert that even this prospect is splendid! In that case, QuadEx within the realm of residential life would assume an analogous role to that of Shooters within the sphere of revelry — a rather pedestrian establishment, indeed, but one that extends an invitation (unlike the exclusive themed parties hosted by fraternities) even to those who have not memorized the names of five brothers’ pet dogs or those guys who are not that tall or dashing. QuadEx does not claim to supplant existing social circles; rather, its intended purpose is to provide solace to those students who are atypically reserved, reticent or encounter financial constraints preventing them from indulging in a vibrant social life. It grants them access to rudimentary social gatherings — even if it is just a modest watch party — and also assigns a faculty member the role of a guardian. We claim to be concerned about low-income students, but a curious reversal occurs when Duke University assimilates them into an opt-out social circle, bestows substantial financial support upon the Quad Council and tells these economically disadvantaged students, ""Hey, we also have tailgate parties with snacks, courtesy of your very own Quad Council."" Suddenly, the same detractors vociferously decry, ""Fun is a privilege reserved solely for insular cliques!"" Let us now turn our attention to the biggest critique leveled against QuadEx: “But we cannot room with friends.” To be candid, I have never viewed this as an issue. Every year, I have elected to be assigned random roommates, not even attempting to form a housing block, and on each occasion, I have cultivated a fresh circle of friends. My roommates over the years have spanned three different ethnicities, attended high school in four different countries, studied three different majors, been both richer and poorer than me and have had different sexual orientations. They have all enriched my college experience in their own way. QuadEx does not preclude the possibility of grouping with friends; rather, it confines such groupings to approximately one-seventh of Duke's undergraduate populace, mirroring the number of quads. Duke has not ordered students to become best friends with their roommates. The contention that one cannot locate a compatible roommate among the one-seventh slice of Duke's student body appears incredulous. Students are not coerced into living with wholly arbitrary individuals; rather, their roommate pool remains a subset of Duke students. While it is true that Duke has some who have unsavory habits or exhibit suboptimal personal hygiene, it remains the case that the average Duke student maintains a robust, functional existence and possesses intellectual acumen surpassing that of the majority of Americans. Furthermore, the housing reassignment portal remains available, permitting individuals to seek alternative living arrangements if they find themselves incompatible with their initial roommates. One remains at liberty to spend the majority of their time with friends in other quads and continue forming acquaintances through participation in clubs, professional organizations and classes. Duke has not been partitioned into seven discrete nations requiring visas to travel in between; rather, it has introduced an additional label to every student, much like one's affiliation as a “Broncos supporter"" or a ""Drake fan."" The stratification of social life along the lines of class or race within Duke will never be eradicated. Indeed, individuals who choose to reside off-campus or in Hollows during their senior year tend to have roommates who share affinities in terms of social standing, fraternity affiliations, akin career aspirations or even racial identity. That is fine; I do not claim that it is malevolent to associate with those whose backgrounds bear resemblance to one's own.However, regrettably, a considerable portion of the population does not appreciate the prospect of forging relationships and fostering camaraderie with individuals whose life experiences diverge markedly from one's own, even if these connections prove short-lived. I, for instance, wholeheartedly endorse Duke's mandatory “three-year residence” policy. One of the reasons the undergraduate years are so special is because college truly is the last time that one can have their residence, food, friends, work and the library all a three-minute walk from each other.

Ghosts of Halloweens past,Barbara Cardenas,2023-10-30T04:00:00Z,Oct,30,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/103023-cardenas-halloween-20231030.html,"The hypnotic allure of Halloween resonates far beyond the tales of haunted mansions or restless spirits. For me, the true enchantment lies in the transformational journey this holiday has offered throughout my life. The blend of nostalgia, anticipation and the raw thrill of metamorphosis has made Halloween a profound marker of personal evolution. And there, tucked away yet ever-present, is a worn-out box — a tangible testament to this journey, each costume a page from a vivid life chapter.Growing up, my childhood home was more than just a house; for one night each year, it became the epicenter of Halloween festivities. My parents, perhaps unknowingly, staged an annual spectacle for adults, demonstrating that the essence of Halloween knew no age boundaries. Their parties were grand, elaborate affairs that effortlessly blended the traditional and the avant-garde. And for a young observer, these events weren't just parties; they were mesmerizing previews into a world of adult camaraderie, creativity and unabashed celebration.An essential rite of passage for each attendee was the scare maze. It wasn’t just about the jump-scares or the sudden appearances of actors, but the adrenaline, the laughter that followed and the collective relief. But once past the maze, the realm that unfurled was even more captivating. It was a tableau of human expression and spontaneity, a myriad of characters, stories and energies converging in one space.Being a spectator of this spectacle with my brothers and cousins, I felt a delightful paradox. The thrills of the scare maze made us feel brave and adventurous, while the allure of the adult party beckoned to our future selves. It was a glimpse into a future where I could be part of such captivating celebrations. Those nights planted in me a yearning and an aspiration: to grow up, to revel in my own Halloween parties and perhaps, someday, host my own legendary gatherings.Parallel to these grand events ran my own personal Halloween journey. Every year, the anticipation of selecting just the right costume became an event unto itself. My preferences evolved, mirroring my own growth and shifts in interests. There was the year of the rockstar, reflecting my dream of commanding vast audiences with electrifying performances. The Mad Hatter phase was an ode to the countless nights spent journeying through Wonderland. The numerous princess avatars, the wandering zombie, the peace-sign flashing hippie and the adventurous pirate — each costume was a symbol, a manifestation of dreams, phases and sometimes, just whims.The beauty of Halloween lies in its universal appeal. My parents’ parties were a testament to that, showing that the joy of transformation isn’t limited by age. College brought with it new terrains and contexts. Gone were the familiar settings of hometown celebrations, replaced with dorm parties, themed campus events and impromptu gatherings. And while I wish the essence remained untouched, that hasn’t been the case.Amidst Duke's buzzing nightlife, it always perplexes me that Halloween doesn't shine more luminously. The off-campus houses and venues, echoing with tales of raucous parties and social gatherings, seem the perfect venues for grand Halloween bashes. A university known for its spirit, both in sports arenas and social gatherings, Duke’s off-campus scene would be the ideal canvas for the brilliant shades of Halloween revelry. Yet, the holiday often feels like an understated note in an otherwise resounding symphony of Duke's social life.Perhaps it's the daunting academic challenges that arise during midterm season or the myriad of other events competing for attention, but Halloween seems to miss the spotlight it truly deserves. The sheer joy that Halloween embodies feel right at home amidst Duke's diverse student body. Freshmen and newcomers, seeking their first Duke social experiences, I believe, should be ushered into the magic of Halloween just as fervently as any basketball game or campus tradition.Navigating the space between the vibrant nostalgia of yesteryears and the unfolding promises of university life can be both exhilarating and bewildering. The dichotomy of these two worlds often reminds me of the contrast between the scare maze's unpredictable thrills and the celebratory atmosphere of the adult parties. Just as Halloween night transitions from eerie moonlight to the dawn of a new day, my journey at Duke has been about transitioning from the familiar to the unknown, from the comfort of old traditions to the excitement of creating new ones.Duke has given me numerous moments of camaraderie, growth and learning. And yet, as Halloween approaches each year, I find myself yearning for the expansive celebrations of my childhood. Not just for the costumes and the festivities, but for the sense of community, the shared experiences and the collective effervescence that the holiday symbolizes. It's a reminder that while we move forward, embracing the new and adapting to change, it's equally essential to carry forward the traditions and memories that have shaped us.My old box of costumes has grown heavier over the years, both in weight and significance. It's a tangible chronicle, brimming with fabrics, colors and memories. Some pieces evoke laughter, some nostalgia and some, contemplation. They serve as reminders of fleeting phases, persistent dreams and the ever-changing canvas of identity.Halloween is more than just a holiday for me — it’s a time capsule. It’s a blend of traditions inherited, experiences lived and aspirations for the future. It's about acknowledging the past, reveling in the present and dreaming of the years to come. As the pages of this chronicle continue to unfold, the box will expand, costumes will be added and the legacy of a lifetime of Halloweens will flourish. Through the shifting landscapes of time and age, the spirit of Halloween remains eternal, echoing the joy of transformation, tradition and timeless celebration.Barbara Cardenas is a Trinity junior.

Redefining success: Embracing alternative assessments in higher education,Maria Kunath,2023-10-30T04:00:00Z,Oct,30,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/103023-kunath-exams-higher-education-20231030.html,"In her OP-Ed “Exams are at risk of extinction,” Chronicle opinion columnist and first-year Anna Garziera examines the current trends of American higher education shifting away from exams — think blue book midterms and the SAT and ACT you had to take for admissions — as the gold standards for success. She claims that exams provide valuable benchmarks for success and that we’re losing something precious by removing ourselves from exam culture. Furthermore, Garziera argues that the stressful nature of formal examinations actually builds resiliency, so that students can maximize their potential.But do these exams actually help students retain information long-term? Are they helping learners learn?First, a quick bit about me: I work as a learning experience designer for Duke Learning Innovation, a group that partners with faculty to teach and support quality, student-centered education at Duke. While I help design online courses, other members of my department consult with faculty on teaching and technology and conduct research on education and assessment.Now to answer our questions.Educational psychology suggests that high-stakes examinations — either in admissions tests like the SAT or the traditional midterm/finals format— work counter to the psychological processes of human memory. Dr. Sanjay Sarma, the head of open learning at MIT, wrote that high-stakes examinations are actually a detriment to the long-term retention of information. Students who cram — a process familiar to most university students — earned better results on test day. But compared to students who spaced their learning over an extended period — five hours over five days instead of five hours the night before an exam — they retain less information over time. Crammers forget much of what they studied as they move into the next semester or course. Although professors aren’t counseling their students to study in this manner, the culture surrounding high-stakes examinations perpetuates this approach. When good marks on high-stakes exams are imperative to the ‘next step,’ such as the job or the graduate program of choice, students will cram. There’s a concept in the psychology of memory called cognitive load. There’s a gap between the information you already know and the information you are learning. Ideally, one could fit as much information as possible into this gap, à la an all-you-can-eat buffet. But you’re limited here by your cognitive load — the idea that there is a limited amount of information a human brain can take in at any given time. You can break the cognitive load of any learning experience — whether changing a tire or analyzing data from a particle accelerator — into three parts: the intrinsic, extraneous and germane loads. The intrinsic load — how innately difficult is the information? — can’t really be changed. However, the extraneous load — ways the instructional materials simplify or hinder direct instruction of the topic — and the germane load — the effort needed to process the information being learned — can be refined to maximize learners’ innate capabilities for long-term memory. Exams create enormous amounts of anxieties that overburden the extraneous and germane aspects of cognitive load. In the pressure cooker environment of studying for and taking a high-stakes exam, working memory becomes less efficient at converting information to long-term memory.But Garziera also argues a more subtle point: The stress of high-stakes exam culture builds resiliency. She claims that, besides the fact that good grades on these exams are needed for good opportunities, the resiliency that comes from exam stress will lead to future success. The dad in “Calvin and Hobbes” is famous for saying “It builds character” about anything from a bad school day to biking in a blizzard. Although I always identified more with Calvin, I see the wisdom in Garziera’s argument. Stress leads to peak performance, and then the expertise achieved after the stressor can lead to continued success … but it all depends on what kind of stress we’re talking about. Good stress is doable stress. It happens when there is a gap between the known and the unknowable. Good stress happens when the target is still slightly out of reach, but you can get there with support. Garziera’s anecdote about her first overnight class trip in kindergarten is a great example of an educator leveraging good stress into a great learning experience. While the kids’ first night away from their families was always going to be a scary experience, Garziera’s teacher helped little Anna adapt by dancing with her. Here we see how the teacher bridged the gap between the known — the positive relationship between student and teacher — and the unknown of a night away from family, by highlighting a familiar, joyous relationship. The teacher didn’t tell the children to power through, or be grateful for the rigorous educational experience that they were embarking on. Rather, she supported her students by helping them bridge an experiential gap. High-stakes exam culture does not leave room for this kind of support. Rather, learners are forced solo across this gap, and some don’t make it.What is being done at Duke in response to our improved understanding of the psychology of learning? What kinds of assessments are taking the place of high-stakes exams? Exams don’t necessarily equal the practice of complex skills and information that has been in long-term memory, and my department works with faculty and students to help bring pedagogically — that is, things related to teaching — best practices in all learning spaces at Duke. For example, best practice in the pedagogy of assessment involves opportunities to do project-based assessments, and there have been a number of Duke professors we’ve worked with — such as Dr. Len White in neuroscience — who put this into action in their teaching. I’d love to know more about the experiences of navigating the student side of this shift in our educational ecosystem. My colleagues periodically survey Duke students to gain a better understanding of what their learner experience has been so we can continue to improve the Duke educational experience.But all our work and discussion around high-stakes exam culture is nested inside American university culture as a whole. How do the pedagogical changes that Duke students see in the classroom impact our wider Duke ecosystem? How do they reflect changes in the ecosystem of American universities as a whole?How do we know we’ve been successful if we haven’t gone through multiple barriers of entry, like high-stakes examinations, to get to our goal? I imagine students at Duke think about this frequently. Many of you probably picked Duke because of its selectivity, and what that implied about the quality of education. Garziera’s questions of success, what it means to be successful at Duke and after Duke, alongside her questions about what value, if any, we should place on high-stakes examinations, or even how to psychologically cope with our rapidly changing world, are all philosophical questions. I firmly believe that anyone who works in and for the Duke education system should become a philosopher — that is, a lover of wisdom and knowledge. As we embrace digital tools and platforms for education, we are going to see society shift its understanding of what universities do. I’m excited to make Duke a multifaceted place where the love of wisdom, academic exploration and intellectual development can coexist alongside knowledge-based skills training.Maria Kunath is a learning experience designer for Duke Learning Innovation.

What's the big deal about New York?,Heidi Smith,2023-10-30T04:00:00Z,Oct,30,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/103023-smith-big-deal-about-new-york-20231030.html,"Where do you want to live after graduation, and why did you answer New York City? Now, I’m generalizing here, but you can’t deny the pull of the city, whether you grew up in the middle of nowhere and see it as a beacon of having made it big or in New Jersey and list it as your Metropolitan Area on your LinkedIn page. All I’m saying is that I’ve never heard someone say, “I got this great job, but, ugh, it’s in New York City.”This New York centricity isn’t just a hunch — according to Duke Alumni, NYC is currently the second most populated region for Duke grads, second only to the Triangle. Growing up in rural Ohio, I dreamed of escaping to somewhere where there were, at the very least, more Democrats than cows — no offense to cows. When I wanted to be a fashion designer, New York held all the potential in the world. A writer: London and Paris; a software engineer: San Francisco. As I was rather disappointed or felt ambivalent by those latter three, I knew not to get my hopes up for NYC, which I’d often heard Ohioan describe pejoratively.Much to the surprise of my Duke peers, I had never visited New York City until fall break of this year — it was a great fun fact that I don’t know think I can ever top. As much as I wanted to hate it — or love it, as it lacks much middle ground — I thought it was fine. Perhaps that is the most controversial way to feel about it. New York’s not the worst city I’ve ever been to, but it’s certainly not my favorite. It made me think about what subconscious urge drew me to make it a focus of my job search in the same league as places I’d visited and knew I liked.The first such reason recursively goes back to the question at hand: I, like everyone, want to go to New York City because everyone else wants to go to New York City. It seems a sensical urge as a student in a place where many friendships are made out of convenience or circumstance and cease to exist when the winds change. You won’t be forced into testing the staying power of your friendships if you move to the same place and retain the same general sense of convenience. Beyond that, if you already know a handful of classmates in your new city post-grad, you won’t be forced to start from scratch, friendship-wise — in a much less forgiving environment than freshman year, no less.I must qualify that I speak of this from the lens of someone who spends most of their time with peers going into tech, finance, business or perhaps something humanities-adjacent. I get the sense that for politics and policy students, DC may hold a broader appeal. For those attending graduate and professional programs, it’s wherever the heck they can get a good scholarship. All I can say is that for the nontrivially large subgroups of our student population who place importance on NYC, it’s a tangible pressure. It’s especially fascinating to see this shift in tech: the transition from glamorizing Silicon Valley to Silicon Alley. As young, privileged students, we often have the ability to choose to live in the places that continue to thrive and can leave those that aren’t. Fads come and go, for cities as all other things; New York is New York.While there are certainly tangible benefits to living in the Big Apple writ large, the more nebulous idea of the image associated with it is even more enticing. It no longer matters what the city as a city is like, but instead, the importance exists because we are so infatuated with the desire that is New York. Frankly, we like the idea of saying we will be living in NYC because we know our peers will be pleased to join us or jealous that they can’t. The fantasy of the city gives us enough hope to gloss over any less desirable parts, whether that be the cost of living, a less-than-perfect first job or how crowded it is.It initially seemed quite odd that the power of New York weighed so heavily in the minds of my peers. The root of the issue, I think, lies in our immense desire to have the very best of everything. It’s not only a desire, though; we genuinely believe we deserve it and act as such. Thus, it becomes simple and logical to choose the city that holds the most cultural capital in the country and see it as a need instead of a want.Is it possible that so many Duke students genuinely want to go to NYC qua NYC? I’ll speak for myself; I don’t, really. It seems fine for a few years, but there are other places I’d rather live. I’m mostly worried that it will be hard to make friends post-college, especially in our world that is — irresponsibly — moving towards remote work as a norm, and NYC seems to be one of the few places that has bounced back from COVID socially and an easier-than-most place to be an independent woman. But I mean, when it comes down to it, it’s just a place. If you’re depressed in New York, you’re still depressed (but you’re in New York!).I won’t minimize that a lot of people do genuinely want to go to New York for compelling reasons, but I’d contend that this is not everyone. Fewer than a third of Americans aged 18-29 expressed a wish to live in an urban area post-COVID, and for Americans at large, it’s fewer than 20%. No, perhaps the average Duke student is not the average American, but I imagine that there is a large percentage of us who are not super keen on living in a city. Frankly, I feel I’ll be left behind professionally and socially, if I do not move somewhere urban.I would love to live in a politically purple small town with plenty of nature and a few good friends nearby. Unfortunately, in our time of geographically-based political separation, this is a pipe dream. The gap between liberal urbanites and conservative rural folk is only made worse by elite college students — the very archetypes Trump uses to garner the support of low-income whites — idealizing and choosing cities like NYC as the center of their own personal universes. When everyone around us seems to want the same things in the same places, it’s a lot harder to be sympathetic to people who have and want vastly different lifestyles.New York City is an exceptional place in that — in its role as a melting pot — we forget how unrepresentative of the country at large it is. New York allows people like us to play at being the underdog while living out dreams and dealing with problems that are often minimal in nature. As future engineers, policymakers, doctors, anything, we must remember that while NYC is an epicenter of culture for our country, it is not the end all be all and should not be treated as such.Heidi Smith is a Trinity senior.

HRL embraces inner troll in Halloween festivities,Monday Monday,2023-10-30T04:00:00Z,Oct,30,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/103023-monday-monday-hrl-halloween-20231030.html,"The most frightful time of the year is upon us, and everyone is feeling the Spooky Season chills. With the construction on West setting the mood (and the scent), Housing and Residence Life is upping its programming this year with a swath of Halloween-related festivities. In the spirit of the medieval aesthetic of Duke, RAs have finally been granted battering rams to knock down doors of residents who are being deemed overly rowdy and “disrupting the great peace of the halls of academia,” according to a memo published by HRL. As dorms switch to Quad Access Only at midnight, RAs will patrol the turrets of West in knight costumes and rain arrows down upon freshmen who missed the last C1. On-call phones have been disabled. Instead, students seeking late-night assistance must seance with their RA-on-call through an intricate ritual of meditation and battery-powered tea lights (remember: open flames are not allowed in dorms). Those unlucky enough to be locked out of their dorms this Halloweekend were met with an unpleasant surprise. The Dean on Call was spotted crouching on the McClendon Tower bridge, halting all who passed.“If to your dorm you’d like the key, you must first answer these riddles three!” cackled the Dean when approached. Students who refused to indulge the troll were tossed off of the bridge to the abyss of Keohane below. In an email to Monday Monday, HRL explained that this was actually not part of any Halloween special event and rather just implementation of their new customer service optimizations. The email also confirmed that the McClendon Tower elevator was purposefully shut off to terrify students into getting off their asses to go down a flight of stairs.HRL is also sponsoring a seance on the steps of the Chapel to communicate with the ghost of Washington Duke. They warn students of color to caution attendance, lest they spook the University’s namesake into a tirade on how the South deserved to win the Civil War.Halloween comes to a close with the HRL-sponsored costume competition on Halloween night.

The climate costs of conference realignment,Aaron Siegle,2023-10-27T04:00:00Z,Oct,27,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102723-siegle-climate-costs-conference-realignment-20231027.html,"On Sept. 1, the ACC unofficially became the All Coast Conference after its additions of Stanford, Cal and SMU. Like a vulture feeding on a rotting carcass, the ACC capitalized off the surprisingly swift decline of the Pac-12 (the most prominent college athletic conference in the Western US) to expand its national appeal. While ACC executives framed the move as necessary for survival in the anarchic world of college sports, it is apparent that the primary motivation for this move was TV revenues. The ACC is posed to gain over $600 million from its contract with ESPN as a result — and that doesn’t include revenue earned from other multimedia companies.The shocking gambit evoked plenty of punditry from the sports world — mostly reminiscing about the tragedy surrounding the downfall of the ‘Conference of Champions.’ But the real tragedy lies off the field. Conference realignment entails thousands of miles of transcontinental travel on a weekly basis. That travel will emit billions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, despite many universities identifying climate change as an institutional priority. However, these concerns get drowned by trivial discussions of a potential Stanford-Duke rivalry or what the new divisions of an 18-school ACC will look like. Only when conference realignment eventually runs into the realities of climate change will the foolishness of universities be exposed.Just a mere 20 years ago, the ACC contained eight teams (three of which were in the Triangle), with the longest trip a visiting team would have to make being 732 miles from Florida State to the University of Maryland. The other power five conferences also were geographically compact, limiting the need for long flights or travel across time zones. But this harmonious balance of power was quickly upended when in the early 2010s conferences began to poach other schools — including the notable moves of Missouri and Texas A&M from the Big-12 to the SEC and Maryland from the ACC to the Big Ten. With the advent of cable TV, conferences realized adding more TV markets to their portfolio would supersize earnings, spurring the realignment revolution. These changes — though minor — awakened conference commissioners to the power that they possessed. Hardly constrained by insufficient state and federal regulations or the toothless NCAA, conferences realized schools were willing to enter a Faustian bargain with the highest bidder.As the SEC and Big Ten gained sports hegemony with their additions of flagship institutions such as Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Iowa, Maryland and Rutgers, the remaining 3 power five conferences felt they needed to play the acquisition game to survive. Still reeling from the loss of its two biggest members, Texas and Oklahoma, the Big-12 responded decisively, snagging four Pac-12 schools. Not to be left behind, the ACC sounded the death knell of the Pac-12 by adding Cal and Stanford. Never mind that Palo Alto is 2,380 miles away from Durham.In the old days when conferences followed the rules of geography, most away games could be reached by bus, which is far more environmentally friendly than air travel for short trips. But, given that it is infeasible for a visiting team to drive across the country, a larger share of away games will now require flights. A single round trip (economy class) from RDU to San Fransisco emits 1.04 metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. While that may not seem like much, remember that the average traveling party for a football team is around 100 members including players, coaches and support staff. Moreover, this does not include the thousands of die-hard fans who religiously travel to all the away games. Furthermore, this mass migration must now occur five or six times per season. Unfortunately, these metrics only account for one team in a now 18-member conference.Based on these assumptions (which definitely can be further refined), the emissions from air travel alone for a single team and its fanbase for one season would be around 47,000 CO2 metric tons of emissions. In other words, emissions from this travel would cause just over 26 football fields of polar ice caps to melt. This does not account for the realities of radiative forcing, where sources of emissions at high altitudes (think airplanes) have a greater impact on global warming. And this only accounts for one football team, not the plethora of other sports that will now have to make this arduous cross-country trek.While severe, the climate impacts must not overshadow the human impacts of conference realignment. Athletes will have to miss more classes, recover from jetlag and navigate long stints away from home. Family and friends who want to watch their athlete play in person will now have fewer opportunities to do so. Coaches will have less time to devote to recruiting and game preparation. These concerns — which were raised by Professor Donald Taylor at a recent academic council meeting — have profound implications for an academically rigorous school like Duke.The irony of the debacle is that the people who are most negatively impacted by realignment, athletes, do not receive any additional compensation for the increased burden. It is unlikely that scholarship amounts or Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) deals are dependent on how many teams the ACC has. While conference realignment was clearly driven by the revenue earning sports (football and basketball), the ramifications apply to all sports. Many Olympic sports, such as baseball and softball, have far more games than the football team, meaning that they will bear an even greater travel burden.If these sports aren’t the reason for conference realignment, then why should they have to suffer from it? To protect both climate and athlete health, Division I schools should return to their old conferences for all sports except for football and basketball. While it would be ideal if all sports played teams in their region, I acknowledge that no amount of climate science will ever convince university administrators to forgo millions of dollars of TV revenue. But, universities could still have their pots of gold and some climate impacts could be mitigated if conferences varied based on sports. In fact, the athletics departments would actually save money by not sending their Wrestling or Field Hockey teams on transcontinental flights.Already, some athletic programs have found success with this model. Johns Hopkins University competes in Division III’s Centennial Conference while its premier sport, lacrosse, participates in the Big Ten. Similarly, Division I hockey has unique conferences which closely align with geographic regions. These successes should be replicated across all of Division I sports.Conference realignment isn’t only a tragedy because of the death of classic rivalries but of the planet itself. However, separating conferences based on sport can bolster athletic revenues while keeping significant amounts of CO2 out of the atmosphere. In this way, we can salvage both athlete health and environmental sustainability from the dumpster fire of conference realignment. Let’s take this sensible action so that college sports will still be around a century from now.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity sophomore. His column typically runs on alternate Fridays."
Winter is coming. Get outside now!,Anna Sorensen,2023-10-27T04:00:00Z,Oct,27,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102723-sorensen-winter-is-coming-get-outside-now-20231027.html,"I have an announcement: It’s officially been seven weeks of classes, and I have yet to spend a single minute of my time doing work in Perkins. No, it’s not because I haven’t had work or haven’t needed to “lock in.” I’m a normal student, come on. I will admit — I have gone to Vondy (or Perk Cafe as some call it), and I’ve been to the Link once or twice. Still, I have managed to survive half a semester without shutting myself inside a library. Where, you may ask, have I been? Well, as Johnny Cash once said, “I’ve been everywhere, man.” Specifically, I’ve been everywhere outside … man. I wrote my paper on the Watergate scandal seated on the swinging benches at BC Plaza, and I read the entirety of Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye in the Duke Gardens. I have made outline after outline on the bridge to McClendon Tower. I have even strolled to the Al Buehler trail once or twice to complete an assignment. There’s apparently a rooftop garden in E-Quad that I have my eye on for next week. I work outside for many reasons. For one, it’s still a perfect temperature outside, and I am trying to take as much advantage of it as possible before winter and darkness descends on Durham. When giving tours to prospective Duke students, I always make sure to emphasize the climate here because I honestly believe it’s part of what makes the student experience so great. So much of campus is structured in a way that allows us to be out in nature, and it is certainly intentional. Spending time outside not only makes me grateful for nature, but it also makes me grateful for Duke. This brings me to my second point. Duke is a gorgeous campus, and we don’t always take the time to look around and appreciate it. When we hurry from building to building every day, we miss the beauty that surrounds us. Last year, especially during the harder times of the year, I trudged between classes with my head down and headphones on. It took a toll on my mental health. This year, looking up and looking around has helped me through plenty of moments of stress and anxiety. Paying attention to where I am grounds me and forces me to get out of my own head for a second. There have been times when I have been so caught up on a piece of work only to pause, get up, take a breath of fresh air and realize I actually know how to approach the problem. Working outside actually makes doing work more enjoyable too. Consequently, when I am in a happier state of mind, the work I produce reflects that. I have had some pretty astounding moments of inspiration sitting outside with my books and computer. More than that, I am beginning to reassociate what it means and how it feels to do work in college. I think we often adopt a mindset of “grinding” or just “getting through” our work here at Duke. Some of us complain constantly about it and others procrastinate endlessly to avoid it altogether. I believe a lot of this comes from the experience of doing work and the environment we create for ourselves when we sit down and churn it out.What if we tried to set ourselves up to be a little happier when we do our work? I am not going to try to suggest here that every P-Set or every discussion post is going to be a life-changing experience of joy. I understand that there are times when some people need to eliminate all distractions and focus intensely to finish a piece of work. I do, however, believe that this does not need to be the default. I think it’s reasonable to imagine a schedule that balances being outside and working outside with blocks of sharp focus. Making time to be outside is scientifically proven to promote mental health, wellbeing, and analytical abilities. A UC Davis study based on the National Library of Medicine’s research discovered that being outside boosts creativity and problem-solving skills. It also relieves tension in our muscles, lowers blood pressure and heart rates and helps boost our Vitamin D supply. Need more convincing? Spending time outside also helps you sleep more easily and consistently. I don’t think I need to convince you of how important that is. So, as the days grow shorter and the clouds begin to emerge, take advantage of our campus climate and venture outside. You may discover a new place of solitude nestled somewhere in our eight-thousand-acre campus. Or you may see a place you’ve passed hundreds of times in a new light. Bring some work, settle in and enjoy a moment of peace to get that genius brain of yours churning. Anna Sorensen is a Trinity sophomore. Her column typically runs on alternate Tuesdays."
Time to drop the foreign language requirement,Jean DuBois,2023-10-27T04:00:00Z,Oct,27,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102723-dubois-drop-foreign-language-requirement-20231027.html,"However well intended, Trinity's three-semester foreign language requirement is unnecessary, and there are much better ways to achieve its stated purpose of fostering “global understanding,” as Trinity’s website describes. The requirement should be dropped or modified substantially for many reasons.First, three courses is a significant amount of a student’s curriculum. That's almost a semester of courses in itself. You can get a minor or certificate in many things by taking three courses.Second, let’s face it, even with three semesters, you won’t be fluent in any language. Fluency most often requires living in a place (or household) that speaks the language. Third, it’s crazy expensive to take three courses of a language, which together constitute almost a full semester of course work. If the the goal is to learn a language, one can do so on line quicker for a few hundred dollars. That's worth repeating: students — and their families — are spending about $30,000 (if they pay full tuition) at Duke to take three course to gain minimal fluency in a language. Talk about elitist. Fourth, if it’s so important, why doesn’t Pratt require it of its students?Fifth, speaking a foreign language is actually less necessary than ever. English has been adopted globally as the universal language. When I was a college student, if you travelled to Europe and tried to speak English, natives would refuse (even if they knew English). But today, it’s the opposite. Travel the world and if you try to speak the local tongue, natives will often respond in English and tell you they want you to speak English so they can practice and improve their English.But most important, even if the goal is some vague “global understanding,” then being forced to take three semesters of language doesn’t achieve it. Not even close. If that’s the goal — so we are less ethnocentric — then swap language classes for history, political, philosophy and sociology classes of foreign cultures. That is way more likely to create “global understanding” than forcing three semesters of a foreign language on students.In sum, assuming it was ever useful — or pedagogically worthwhile — the language requirement has outlived its utility. It only maintains because of inertia, wokeness or because of departmental politics (i.e. full employment act for language departments). I suppose one would run afoul of the DEI deities if one had the audacity to question it. But that's all the more reason to lean in and do so now.If we analyze this dispassionately, it’s long past time the requirement is abandoned. At a minimum — same as at almost all other schools like Northwestern or UNC Chapel Hill — students should be able to test out of it or satisfy it in alternative ways. For instance, taking one semester of Spanish and then taking a semester abroad in Bolivia will leave a student a better Spanish speaker with deeper cultural understanding than taking three semesters of Spanish in Durham. Likewise, taking history and political science classes of foreign cultures will leave a student better versed in the culture than learning a language they may never use.All said, there's a reason Duke is an outlier in requiring three semesters of a language, and it's not because Duke is a leader or ahead of the curve.Jean DuBois is a Trinity alum from the Class of 1990."
Children of immigrants: On guilt and drive,Susan Chemmanoor,2023-10-27T04:00:00Z,Oct,27,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102723-chemmanoor-immigrant-dreams-burdens-20231027.html,"I am a child of immigrants. My parents immigrated from India to the U.S. in the late 90’s. I live to make them proud, but I’m okay with that. This need to repay immigrant parents for their sacrifices is branded as “immigrant guilt”. It’s a feeling of emotional debt that is simply a part of the second-generation immigrant experience. You see, I was indebted to my parents before I even existed. They were making sacrifices for me to live a better life – the American life – before I was conscious. And it’s not something I take lightly. It’s what drives me. When I study for a test, I am not simply being a good student: I’m making good on a promise, a promise that I won’t let the sacrifices of the people who came before me go to waste. A vow to not let the loneliness and bravery of moving to a new country be futile. An oath that being thousands of miles away from their own parents won’t be for an ungrateful daughter. They gave me the chance at a better future, and now I have to make it a reality. I know it sounds dramatic, but it’s real. Now, don’t get me wrong, I want to be great for myself and my own values, but I’m mainly driven by a need to recompense my parents.So, I carry that expectation to be great with me everywhere. I carry the sacrifice of my mother and my father. I carry the toil of my grandparents — the ones in Bangalore apartments that read this column every other week and compliment the big words I like to use (hi appappa and ammamma). I lift the honor of my homeland with my heart so I don’t risk buckling under the weight.All that baggage fatigues me. There’s no room for rest when you’re convinced you need to pay back an eternal debt. Immigrant guilt forces me to never be complacent but simultaneously makes leisure feel like a crime. The guilt is insidious rather than blatant. It sits disapprovingly in the corner of my mind as I watch TV. It scoffs at the idea of a fun weekend out. It glorifies burnout and justifies sleepless study nights. It completely warps my perception of productivity. Through the lens of immigrant guilt, to be productive means to toil, to suffer and to drown in Google Calendar appointments.However, it doesn’t have to be that way. I don’t have to suffer to be a grateful daughter. So, recently, I’ve been trying to re-frame how I look at leisure. I’ve been trying to convince myself that rest can also be the foundation for future greatness. As writer Audre Lorde said, “Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.” Self-care is an epic step in the saga of success. It’s something radical and deeply necessary. It could be the sustenance my body needs to keep pushing — to keep making good on my promise. After all, I can’t save the world if I don’t get enough sleep. I can’t become a doctor without some Gilmore Girls in my life.Maybe one day my debt will be “paid” off. Maybe one day the immigrant guilt will leave me to watch movies in peace. Until that day, I will continue to wear that guilt like a badge of honor. It signifies something larger than myself. It represents generations of my family who worked to secure a better life for their kin. It captures the heartbreak, the chaos and the courage of moving to a new country. It reminds me of why I’m able to be here at Duke and who I’m trying to make proud.Susan Chemmanoor is a Trinity first-year. Her column typically runs on alternate Fridays."
An ode to the women’s bathroom,Umang Dhingra,2023-10-27T04:00:00Z,Oct,27,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102723-dhingra-ode-to-the-womens-bathroom-20231027.html,"For every line I wait in to buy a ticket to a concert, a play or a sporting event, I wait in a line profoundly longer when I am actually there to use the washrooms. There is massive inequity in the way men’s and the way women’s bathrooms are constructed, which is why women often experience significantly longer wait times in public places than men do. And while that is an incredibly important conversation to have, that is not the focus of this article. The focus of this article is how women’s restrooms are places where we, unabashedly and without inhibition, uplift each other.In a world that actively positions and thrives off of women hating each other, the restroom is where we break the mold. Because in the washroom, the cultural fallacy of how all female friendships need to be toxic changes into, “I love your top!”, and, “Where did you get your incredible leggings from?”. The myth of how we are all competing for the male gaze turns into AirDrop-ing the link to the cute dress I got at Target because the stranger I just met would look gorgeous in it. The idiosyncrasy of, “I refuse to be friends with women because they are too much drama,” becomes, “I didn’t know you before tonight, but I’ll hold your hair up if you need to vomit.”This phenomenon is beyond simple conversations that involve compliments about skirts and bedazzled shoes. To those who might have never experienced (and might never experience) what a women’s bathroom feels like, they exemplify the principles that make us incredibly human — the unapologetic support we extend to each other, the confrontations we make with love and the kindness we offer expecting nothing in return. It’s the way we help dab the tears away of people we barely know because, intuitively, it just feels like the right thing to do. We knock on doors to make sure strangers are okay. Hugs are offered and compliments are given because every single woman in these rooms knows what it feels like to be trodden down, so much so that we refuse to let others like us feel that way.I don’t mean to argue that all women are perfect, that we all love and care for each other and that we all march to the drum of an undying sisterhood. As with any relationship, female friendships can turn toxic. There are women among us who struggle with them, those who are convinced that they are ‘not like other girls.’ I have been that woman, and I am so tremendously apologetic about it. I have found so much meaning, so much forgiveness and so much kindness in my friendships with other women — it breaks my heart that I was once somebody who actively chose to pull them down when together we could have been lifting each other up all along. The problem isn’t in admitting that we are flawed; the problem is in when we refuse to do better. The problem is when we refuse to give flowers to those who deserve them. The problem is when we stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us, but shun those who come after.This is me trying, at the very least, to fix my own problem. This is me trying to give credit where credit is due.To the girl whose stall door I held close at Shooters because it had no locks, I will love you forever. To the girl who left her phone in the communal washrooms, didn’t realize it until 30 minutes after and made us walk around the dorm looking for it, thank you for letting me call you my best friend. To the girl who sat with me on the washroom floor and talked about everything from books to bands to boys, I will always be so grateful to know you. To the girl whose name I do not know but hugged me at a party between vomit and tears and told me she loved my makeup, I hope you are doing okay.So much of womanhood, especially in this political climate, is agony and anger and grief. The women’s washroom — as momentary as it may be — is knowing that your nameless and faceless sisterhood is real. Briefly, it is a sense of how, in a world that refuses to give us what we are worthy of, we hold each other up. For a second, a stranger becomes a friend. There is so much that needs to be done to build a more equitable world (and a feminist movement) for everyone everywhere, so much so that it might feel overwhelming, like we will never cross the ever moving finish line. But for a moment, when a stranger in the public women’s restroom asks if you’ll teach her how to do winged eyeliner, it feels like it’ll all be okay.Umang Dhingra is a Trinity sophomore.

Duke alumni: How Duke should address its lack of economic diversity,Maryellen Fullerton,2023-10-26T04:00:00Z,Oct,26,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102623-fullerton-alumni-economic-diversity-letter-20231026.html,"In our previous recently published letter, we wrote as alumni of Duke University to urge the leadership to set goals that lead to fair and equitable employment practices, sustainable environmental policy and responsible investment strategies. We also indicated that we would address the lack of economic diversity at Duke in a separate letter. This is that letter.Over the last few decades, America's elite, private universities have become gatekeepers and guardians of our nation's steadily widening economic divide. As an entrenched member of that group, Duke University has embraced these roles. History, culture and administrative decisions have led Duke to ignore economic diversity — as documented in a recent, well-publicized New York Times article — while fueling regional class and racial disparities.Many are now aware of Duke's extraordinarily poor record of promoting economic diversity in its student body. Some may feel slightly encouraged by President Vincent Price's assurances that things are getting better. Many others remain deeply troubled that Duke has created a two-tiered campus outside the classroom, where access to social life and even food choices are largely dictated by family income. Without a thorough reimagining of social opportunities — free of elitist assumptions of how the world works — the school will continue to reinforce the cultural aspects of class inequality that increasingly infect and hobble American life. Many of us are men and women who arrived on campus in the 1960s and 1970s. The values we learned in the classroom and the larger Durham community shaped our lives and led to decades of political and social activism. While we marvel at the accomplishments of the university since our time there, we believe that Duke's current direction is at odds with the best of its history and the needs of our community and nation.The Duke of today retains an important similarity with the Duke of 1968 — a university striving for greatness while reluctant to confront at an institutional level the basic issues of its time and place. Yet just as in 1968, when more than a thousand Duke students camped out on the main quadrangle in a Silent Vigil in support of a collective bargaining agreement with striking non-academic workers, most of whom were African Americans working for minimum wage, we know that real change is possible. What will Duke be like in the 2020s? We believe that the University should take decisive steps to address the lack of economic diversity within the student body.Duke should offer free tuition to all undergraduate students (not just those from North Carolina and South Carolina) whose family earnings are under $150,000. Duke should pay housing, meals, course materials and other critical costs for all students whose family income is under $65,000.To encourage enrollment from the Carolinas, Duke should enter into agreements with North Carolina and South Carolina community colleges that robustly promote transfers to the University.Duke should establish a group, with majority student representation, to determine the costs of full participation in campus life.Duke should establish ongoing efforts to promote student engagement to address community inequalities in class, race and gender.Duke should end legacy admissions as one step toward democratizing higher education.The time has come for change. Duke leadership needs to set goals and take concrete actions to make the resources of Duke University accessible to a much more economically diverse student body. The time is always right to fight for equality and justice. While we cannot know where each step will lead, each step matters. In 1968, it was impossible to know that the Silent Vigil would lead to major changes. Yet within two years, African-American students changed the shape of the university, a union Local 77 began to represent Duke workers and a new president was installed. An undergraduate quoted in that infamous New York Times article asserted, ""The essence of Duke is wanting to bring change not only for yourself but for others.”Let's start now.

It is not too late to plant a tree,Anna Garziera,2023-10-25T04:00:00Z,Oct,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102523-garziera-not-late-plant-tree-20231025.html,"Stranded on campus during Fall Break, I decided to finally take a stroll in the Sarah P. Duke Gardens. For the first time in a while, I had time to spare. This got me thinking: Already half way through the semester, I had not achieved half of the things I had set out to achieve. In today’s world, it can be difficult to help but feel like time is always running out. As when water is escaping a strainer, we desperately try to plug the little holes that are seconds, minutes, hours, but time still finds a way to pass through, leaving us exhausted and unsatisfied. Although this feeling is greatly emphasized by today’s hyperactive, hyper-efficient, hyper-everything society, men throughout the ages have felt a similar remorse with the passing of time. Ever since the earliest civilizations — Ancient Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia — there has been a universal need to believe in life after death. In other words, our one life on Earth has never been enough for most people. Although we may feel superior to these ancient civilizations, the stark reality is that even after thousands of years we think and act just about the same. On a smaller scale, consider this: Few feelings are worse for a child than counting the remaining days of summer break on the calendar that hangs in the kitchen and seeing that the once abundant squares now amount to a meager handful. Yet, what’s worse, reflecting back, is realizing that yet another long summer was squandered in idleness.Even worse, however, is having that feeling perpetuated by acknowledging the years that have passed in one's adult life — accepting one’s inevitable aging is an even more burdensome task. This truth is one that ties us all more closely than we might realize. It is ingrained in our culture. I see it in the jars of anti-wrinkle creams sold in stores, in our fascination at the trunk of a 400-year-old tree, in our belief in heaven (or a concept equivalent to it), in teenagers’ preaching of #YOLO as they enter dangerous situations because life is too short, go live it, it’ll be over before you know it. However, this leads to a problem: We find ourselves torn between wanting to maximize both our current enjoyment and our future output, yet we feel as though we don’t have time for it all.I’ll present to you, then, a solution. What if, instead, we lived a life that in its brevity was fulfilling and left us satisfied? This solution denies our tendency to take everything to the extreme as we attempt to conserve the past, squander the present and prepare for the future, all at the same time.For us students, this consideration applies in this way: the potential self-growth of today should not be diminished by our grieving the time that has already passed or neglected as we fear that the time we have left will pass before we know it. I’ll tell you something you’ve heard before: The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now. While this quote could be misinterpreted as an accusation of sorts, in reality, it offers us a sense of hope: In 20 years, we’ll surely reap the fruits of today’s labor. This mindset is an essential one for college students — it has us shift into a sort of craving to invest in ourselves for our future selves’ sake. As Duke students, one of the most productive investments we can partake in is some sacrifice of leisure to be channeled into our learning, our interests and our relationships. This is because self-growth initiatives quickly become beneficial to us in the long run. Whether one is learning a new language, fulfilling fitness goals or learning to be an adult without the training wheels, these skills — as seeds, if planted early — can be elemental in this long-term success. Then, the offering of “seeds” in this relatively short life is comparatively massive — we should be constantly learning. The extent of our knowledge should feel quite small — the gaps even more evident — as college freshmen. But, the sad reality is that students tend to think of themselves as only that — students. After fulfilling their duties by going to class and maybe completing the homework assignment, that is where the learning stops. (If only students monitored their daily intake of knowledge as strictly as they do their intake of protein, what a different world we would live in!)I had never understood the “Hungry for More?” prompts on my high school textbooks. Now, I understand. As my garden of knowledge widens and deepens, the young and fruitful soil begs for more seeds to nourish. Interests, similarly, should be cultivated with eagerness. We, as Duke students, will likely never again be in a situation that offers us this much variety and access to a near infinite range of opportunity. We could be doing anything: you name it. From research in neuroscience, to volunteering with local food banks, to picking fresh basil at the Duke Farm, there is something for everyone — and if there isn’t, something new can be created.Even with this variety of choice, I would bet that most freshmen have stretched their search far and wide (to the Club Fair and maybe a couple of organizations that put stands outside of Marketplace) and have floated through this first half of the semester content with having joined a club or two. While I can’t speak better for myself, I can recognize the fault in this: We will regret this shortcoming in a few years. People, as seeds, also have to be cared for and relationships nurtured. As we roll into routine this second half of the fall semester, we must not let ourselves simply be satisfied with the group of friends we’ve made so far, the professors we’ve met up with, the number of smiles we’ve shared with strangers as we pass them on the sidewalk. We should want more. If this theory is not extrapolated to the point of social exhaustion, then it can lead to more opportunities, more connections, more support. Then, this ideology gives us a clear course of action: We must hunt for our new year’s resolutions from last January, and even the one before that, and take action today. With two months left in the year, we have to act with conviction that it is not too late. Planting a seed today might get us at least a sprout by December. As we trail off into the second half of the semester, let us not lose ourselves and our purpose. It is not too late to change your grade for that class. It is not too late to join a student organization, to start waking up early, drinking more water or appreciating the sunset once in a while.Here we stand, then, in the center of our garden, with a bag full of seeds. Our job — the tough part — is to go and plant them. Our work is not in vain. We will soon reap the fruits of our labor.Anna Garziera is a Trinity first-year.

Effective altriusm,Valerie Tan,2023-10-25T04:00:00Z,Oct,25,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102523-tan-effective-altruism-20231025.html,"“I spent two months teaching English to North Korean refugees and economic immigrants.”Such was the refrain I recited throughout the summer to anyone who inquired about my time in South Korea. Looks of admiration or nods of approval would almost certainly ensue, if not effusive displays of praise. I played the part, sporting a tight smile, while my insides churned with discomfort at the excessive compliments and embellished perceptions. When I applied to DukeEngage, I was not unaware of the prevalent criticism of the program, at least within the Duke community, for being a vehicle for “voluntourism."" Nor can I wholeheartedly deny that my desire to participate stemmed, at least in part, from the allure of immersing myself in Seoul’s culinary delights, vibrant culture, scenic beauty — and, of course, the bustling metropolis’ linguistic landscape. The prospect of living in an environment where I would have plentiful opportunities to practice a language I had been learning since I was twelve was indubitably enticing.Needless to say, the program’s motivations struck a chord with me. I empathized with the struggles of linguistic discrimination and cultural exclusion that I had witnessed or experienced personally. But it seemed disingenuous to be passionate about a cause I barely understood, having only scratched the surface of its history and context through a couple of pre-departure meetings back then. I felt disconnected and wondered if I would truly be of any help to the students. The transient nature of our intervention, split across several schools at that, only stoked my skepticism.These doubts lingered even after I arrived in Seoul and listened to the school leaders’ elaborate welcome addresses, in which they illuminated various social and legal issues surrounding the education of students from multicultural families, including that of North Korean refugees and their children. The more I learned about the students’ backgrounds, the more I struggled to wrap my head around the significance of the contributions that we, as privileged Duke students who knew next to nothing about them, could make in such a short period of time. Were we really doing them any good by intruding into their lives and forcing them to learn a language with little immediate relevance to their circumstances — especially while they were still struggling to attain proficiency in Korean? Despite the repeated emphasis from our professors and the vice principal that teaching English was not the primary focus but a platform for connecting with the students, I couldn’t shake off my reservations.Alas, throughout the short week spent with each group of children, their disinterest in our lessons could not be more apparent. Even with all their smart devices stowed away safely in their teacher’s custody, we constantly competed for their attention with comics, sketchbooks, water guns, slime, Rubik’s cubes and the like. Apart from the handful who participated actively, albeit begrudgingly, in class activities, most would muster lackadaisical responses only when called upon before retreating into a state of slumber or reverie. Only during the ten-minute breaks between periods was the classroom enlivened by boisterous chatter and resounding laughter, as the children savored the brief respite from the dreariness of our lessons. As much as imparting English was supposed to be a means to a greater end, forging meaningful relationships with them in such a setting seemed impossible. The listless faces and limp attitudes that resurfaced as soon as the chime of the dreaded school bell summoned them back to their seats begged me to question the effectiveness of our methods. Interestingly, however, the end of each week always marked a transition point in our relationship with the children, as we bid each class farewell and moved on to the next group. Once they no longer perceived us as figures of authority, whose primary responsibility was to instruct them in a sterile, academic setting, we were showered with generous displays of affection during every little encounter we had with them.The first and second graders eagerly waited for us to arrive every morning and sought great amusement in playing round after round of hide and seek in the nooks and crannies of the computer room. The third and fourth graders pulled no punches with their loving embraces, sweet professions and incessant requests for us to draw their favorite cartoon characters. On the other hand, the fifth and sixth graders often ambushed us warmly with sneak water gun attacks, their mischievous howls of laughter ricocheting through the hallways as they hastily fled the scene. Lunchtime in the cafeteria was a chaotic affair, as various groups of children fervently beseeched us to join them at their tables, and continued clamoring for our attention even as we sat down to eat with them.Despite our growing rapport with the children, we were careful not to broach the subject of their families, having deduced from contextual cues that this might be a sensitive topic for many of them. But they had a way of opening up at the most unexpected times and bringing tears to our eyes with unprompted, heartbreaking disclosures about their living situations. What struck me the most was the indifferent, matter-of-fact tones in which they related their experiences. It was hard to tell if these stemmed from sheer naivety or desensitization, but either way, their stories instigated me to perceive them in a different light. I began to understand the importance of making each child feel valued, loved and cared for to fill the void left by a lack of parental attention. It was this feeling that endeared us to them, in spite of our clumsy communication skills and pathetic knowledge of cultural references — not to mention the boring English classes we put them through.The eight weeks I spent in South Korea certainly weren’t long enough for me to get to know each and every student, let alone drastically improve the lives of their communities. But the program facilitated the establishment of unprecedented networks of connections, by acquainting me with people and places I probably never would have encountered on my own. It laid the groundwork for potential future engagements, should I choose to continue pursuing this passion. I was heartened to see that the children still vividly recalled and spoke fondly of DukeEngage teachers from previous years. It was a reassuring sign that my work would be carried forward by future cohorts of Duke students, a glimmer of hope that the collective culmination of all our contributions would create a lasting impact over time.On a final note, I would like to reiterate that the work I did last summer was far from volunteering. I consciously steer clear of the term when describing my experience to other people, especially to the children I worked with. It feels condescending and pretentious to imply that I was doing charity work by teaching and befriending them; that simply wasn’t the case. In fact, I was duly compensated for my skills, time and effort. The airfare coverage, free accommodation and decent stipend I received were certainly incongruent with the selfless and unpaid sacrifices typically associated with volunteerism.But does social work always have to stem from altruistic motivations? Is it selfish not to be selfless? Should I be condemned for confessing that these financial benefits, coupled with the linguistic exposure and cultural experience, were pivotal in solidifying my choice to participate in DukeEngage over a summer engineering internship or research stint? As much as we like to cling to the idea of humanitarian work as pure-hearted and selfless, such a lofty ideal would seriously restrict participation in social causes to an affluent minority, leading to the exclusion of many, like myself, who rely on compensation to afford such opportunities.The next time someone criticizes DukeEngage for promoting “voluntourism,"" let us take a moment to reassess the nature of the program and reevaluate the standards we impose upon it. DukeEngage, at its heart, is not a volunteering initiative. For all its limitations and imperfections, there is one thing the program deserves due credit for. It succeeds in fostering effective altruism by increasing the financial accessibility and practical appeal of social work to Duke students.Valerie Tanis a Pratt junior.

"Erasing Black history happens everywhere, even at Duke",Bella Naspinski,2023-10-24T18:11:00Z,Oct,24,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102423-naspinski-black-history-20231024.html,"Hidden deep in the tarnished cement engravings of Abele Quad lies a remarkable, often overlooked piece of Duke’s history. And it’s one you need to know.It was my move-in day at Duke, and my family had accompanied me to West Campus to bid our final goodbyes. As I stepped onto Abele Quad for only the second time in my life, my eyes grazed across the scene surrounding me: tall trees, lush greenery and gothic architecture that nearly convinced me Hogwarts was real. I glanced down toward my feet, recognizing that my status had changed since my last time standing here — from a Duke hopeful to an official student. This campus was my new home. Amid my personal epiphany, my attention was diverted toward an engraving in the sidewalk. It said, “Abele Quad [is] named for Julian F. Abele, the African-American architect who, between 1924 and 1950, designed all the surrounding buildings. ‘If you seek his monument, look around.’” Astounded by my ignorance about this crucial piece of Black history at Duke, I was rendered speechless as I read the engraving again. Directly across from the minuscule cement-engraved recognition of Julian F. Abele lies the statue of James B. Duke, the founder of Duke University and son of a slave owner. So, the next time you’re walking to class, I urge you to stop at Julian Abele’s plaque and acknowledge this: Every beautiful building Duke attributes its notability to was built by a Black man, yet he wasn’t the one immortalized by a statue. Even further, remember that by going to this university, we get to enjoy the fruits of Abele’s labor that he never was able to reap himself due to the era’s deeply segregating Jim Crow laws.So, why does any of this matter?As Duke students, we have a moral obligation to recognize and uplift the minority groups that constitute a crucial part of our history and continue to make indispensable contributions to the university today. We are incredibly privileged to attend Duke, and acknowledging that privilege begins with uplifting Black history. As people of America, it is our responsibility to not allow our history of violence against and oppression of Black communities to be swept under the rug. However, the vestiges of Black history and injustice extend far beyond the confines of West Campus. Duke continues to afflict Black communities, whether it be by minimally recognizing Julian Abele or gentrifying Durham and displacing many of the Black residents who predominantly reside in its lower-income areas.Here’s the even bigger problem with Duke’s surface-level recognition of Julian Abele’s work: this is not the first time Black history has been hardly recognized or erased, and it is certainly not the last. If people are barely aware of the Black history at Duke — an educational institution that was quite literally designed by an African-American man and is located in a city with a substantive Black population — what does that say about the general awareness of this issue throughout the rest of America?Did you know that the murder of Black people was considered the norm from 1877 to 1950 in the South? Let me put this into perspective for you: More than 4,000 racial terror lynchings occurred in Southern states within the given time period — the same time Julian Abele was designing Duke. These were heinous, barbaric murders of Black people — mostly by white mobs — where just about anything warranted murder. Interracial sex, accusation of a crime, casual social interactions, walking into a room with white women, not calling a white man by his correct title — lynching occurred for just about any reason and was used as a fear tactic to oppress Black people. While lynching itself wasn’t legal, its unwritten laws allowed the white murderers of 150 Black people in a courthouse to face no legal repercussions. Similarly, anti-lynching legislation was consistently shut down at the federal level because lynching disproportionately impacted Black people, so passing laws to end the cruel murder of these individuals would be condemned as “racial favoritism” by white policymakers. Let me reiterate: Preventing the heinous murder of thousands of Black Americans was considered “favoritism.”So, why are these crucial events in America’s past hardly mentioned in school? Why is the extensive history of lynchings in America reduced to one lesson on Emmett Till? The answer lies in one recurring issue. Whether it be in the minimal recognition of Julian Abele’s work or America’s indelible history of lynching, Black history is consistently undervalued or stripped from education entirely. This is an incredibly dangerous reality. How are we to create equitable policies, dismantle white supremacy-infiltrated systems and prevent historic recurrence when our common understanding of Black history is superficial, based only on the cursory teachings of the K-12 education system?As much as I believe that the rectification of this issue is long overdue, the erasure of Black history still lingers in modern society, clouding our collective understanding of America’s past. In an appalling, discriminatory trend, eighteen states have implemented “anti-Critical Race Theory” laws that hinder lessons on race and racism in the United States. In a similar Black history-erasing fashion, the word “diversity” is banned in Georgia public schools and the course AP African American Studies is banned in Florida. These modern examples of history erasure deprive students of crucial knowledge about Black history while simultaneously refusing to recognize the invaluable contributions of Black individuals to society. Above all, violence against and oppression of Black communities did not end with lynchings in the 50s. It continues to manifest today as unjustified acts of police brutality against unarmed Black persons, the mass incarceration of Black people and the gentrification of predominantly Black neighborhoods. Black people quite literally must fight for the value of their lives to be recognized by our society through movements like Black Lives Matter, demonstrating that Black history awareness is more critical than ever.Writing this from the perspective of a white person, I recognize that my skin color grants me a certain privilege that limits my ability to fully understand the experiences of people of color. However, I will not allow my privileged position to foster indifference. Instead, I would like it to serve as a catalyst for advocacy. Black children often receive lessons on the history of slavery and the necessity of caution in the presence of law enforcement by their parents. For this reason, I write about Black history awareness, because if people of color aren’t afforded the luxury of ignoring history, then white people should not be either.To ensure that the truth of Black history does not continue on its current path of censorship and erasure, we must resurrect forgotten narratives and histories. By advocating for Black history-inclusive curricula, celebrating Black History Month proudly, expanding our breadth of knowledge on Black history and voting for diversity-supporting legislators, we can fight the cycle of suppression and whitewashed history. The next time you go to the polls, recognize the devastating impacts of voting for legislators who expunge history. When you take a walk through Abele Quad, remember who designed the ground you’re standing on. And most importantly, educate yourself on Black history because the K-12 education system certainly didn’t do it for you.Bella Naspinski is a Trinity first-year.

A contextualized understanding of the recent attacks in Israel and Palestine,Duke Students for Justice in Palestine,2023-10-23T04:01:00Z,Oct,23,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102323-sjp-israel-palestine-contextualized-understanding-20231023.html,"At the time of writing this article (Oct. 22), the death toll from recent devastation in Palestine has increased to 4,651 — including 1,750 children. Following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack and the intensification of Israel’s military campaign against Palestine, President Price — like countless other institutional leaders — condemned Hamas and expressed unequivocal support of Israel, never uttering the word Palestine. Without any acknowledgment of Israel’s actions in the last week — siege, bombardment campaigns, settler violence and forced displacement — Price’s second statement continued to attribute sole responsibility for civilian death to Hamas. He reiterates, “It has now been more than a week since the horrific Hamas terror attacks in Israel.” He then continues, “In that time, thousands of innocent Israeli and Palestinian people have lost their lives.” Price fails to describe how Palestinian lives were lost as if their deaths weren’t caused by Israeli airstrikes, which have now destroyed the third oldest church in the world. Widespread public response to recent events has erased the 75-year history of the Israeli occupation of Palestine. As such, in this article, we provide heavily-sourced and well-evidenced historical, political and humanitarian context that should preclude any understanding of the current turmoil. The so-called Israel-Palestine 'conflict' The narrative often painted of Israel and Palestine is one of a “two-sided conflict.” However, history illustrates a military superpower illegally occupying and perpetuating violence on an indigenous Palestinian people, with the unwavering support of Western powers. In 1947, in opposition to the native Palestinians, the United Nations General Assembly partitioned Palestine into two independent states, one Palestinian-Arab and the other Jewish. A year later, the new Israeli state violently expelled more than 750,000 Palestinians, ethnically cleansing approximately 530 communities. This would be referred to as Al Nakba, “catastrophe” in Arabic. In 1967, Israel, backed by the United States, defeated Egypt, Jordan and Syria in the June War. Israel consequently expelled 300,000 Palestinians and seized East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza. In resolutions 242 and 338, the United Nations recognized Israel’s presence in these territories as an illegal occupation of Palestinian land. Although the U.N. has repeatedly called for the withdrawal of Israel, the state continues to expand its illegal settlements by demolishing and raiding Palestinian homes and encouraging its citizens to settle in internationally recognized Palestinian land. Since 2004, the Israeli government has demolished 7,802 structures, leaving 23,618 Palestinians homeless. The state often justifies this by claiming that “the structures lacked building permits — permits which the Israeli army systematically refuses to grant to Palestinians.” The Israeli occupying state has sought to control every aspect of Palestinian life, inflicting deep “silent harm and psychological trauma… resulting from the erosion of economic, social, and cultural rights,” and leading to severe short and long-term consequences. In the West Bank, Israel has illegally built hundreds of military closures, such as checkpoints, roadblocks and Jewish-only roads, intentionally making “simple daily tasks for Palestinians who are trying to get to work, school or hospital a constant struggle.” In occupied land, Israel has unjustly detained, imprisoned and tortured Palestinians, with over 800,000 arrests and detainments since 1967. They are often “presumed guilty without evidence” and “brutalized in Israeli custody.” Israel’s occupation has also prevented Palestine from establishing any formal army. Israel is ranked as the fourth strongest military in the world, behind only the U.S., China, and Russia. The settler state receives roughly $3.8 billion every year from the U.S., the majority of which is for military assistance. Meanwhile, the U.S. sends Palestinians $500 million, almost all of which goes directly to humanitarian organizations, such as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). The power imbalance is most grimly reflected in the disproportionate death tolls of Palestinian and Israeli civilians. Between 2008 and September of this year, Palestinians suffered 6,407 fatalities and 152,560 injuries in comparison to Israel’s 308 and 6,307, respectively. The dehumanization of the Palestinian people makes their deaths a normal function of occupation. Israeli death is the exception.In a 280-page report, Amnesty International assessed these conditions and concluded, “The totality of the regime of laws, policies and practices described in this report demonstrates that Israel has established and maintained an institutionalized regime of oppression and domination of the Palestinian population for the benefit of Jewish Israelis — a system of apartheid — wherever it has exercised control over Palestinians’ lives since 1948.” To be clear, apartheid is a legal and technical term in international criminal law, as outlined by the U.N. Apartheid Convention. It is perpetrated when “inhumane acts are committed within the context of a systematic attack directed at a civilian population with the intention of creating a system of domination by one racial group over any other.”Human Rights Watch, B’Tselem, and other organizations have reached the same conclusion in their investigations. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories called it “apartheid by default.” Israel-Palestine as a hyphenated notion fails to recognize the severe power imbalance that is a settler-colonial state occupying stolen land and imposing a system of violent apartheid. A growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza The history of violence against Gaza traces back many years, to a time before Hamas even existed. Leading up to 2005, 8,500 Israeli settlers illegally lived in the Gaza Strip, which is internationally recognized as Palestinian land. In 2005, Israel pulled its settlers from Gaza. During the ensuing 16-year blockade, Israel has maintained direct control over Gaza's territorial waters, airspace and six of Gaza's seven land crossings. Israel regulates the flow of imports and exports from Gaza—which at times they have frozen altogether—and controls the water supply, electricity, telecommunications, sewage networks and other utilities. UNICEF's report illustrates the 15-year consequences of Israel’s control:The blockade controls movement and work; the number of allowed exits of people per month from Gaza to Israel went from about 500,000 to below 10,000. Almost 50% of the population is unemployed. Israel only allows 64% of patients access to necessary specialized medical treatments. The Gaza Power Plant only meets about 50% of the electricity demand. 31% of households don’t have the financial resources to access essential education needs.62% of Palestinians in Gaza require food assistance. 78% of piped water is unfit for human consumption. The blockade has decimated Gaza’s economy, with an estimated loss of $16.7 billion between 2007 and 2018. For the 16 years leading up to Oct. 7, these were the conditions imposed upon the people of Gaza, conditions that the Human Rights Watch defines as “systemic oppression” and the U.N. as the largest “open-air prison” in the world. Blockade aside, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are no strangers to Israeli airstrikes and attacks. In 2000, 2008, 2012, 2014, 2018 and 2021, Israel repeatedly met Palestinian resistance, peaceful or not, with disproportionate and large-scale bombardment and military offensive campaigns that targeted civilians:In 2000, after Palestinians protested the Israeli storming of the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, Israel bombed and destroyed Gaza International Airport. In 2008 and 2012, Israel launched major military offensives bombarding Gaza for 22 and for eight days, respectively. In total, these bombardments killed 1,437 Palestinians. 19 Israelis were killed. In 2014, after three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed in the West Bank, Israel launched a seven-week military operation killing 2,251 Palestinians. 73 Israelis were killed. In 2018, Palestinians peacefully protested occupation in the Great March of Return, and in response, Israeli forces used tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition against the crowds. 214 Palestinians were killed, and 36,100 were injured. One Israeli soldier died, and seven were injured. In 2021, Palestinians in East Jerusalem protested against planned evictions and the frequent storming of the al-Aqsa mosque by settlers and soldiers. After Hamas’ demands to quell these provocations were ignored, they fired rockets into Israel. Consequent Israeli airstrikes killed 260 Palestinians. 12 Israelis died. In the five days following Oct. 7, Israel dropped over 6,000 bombs on the densely inhabited territory — more bombs than during its 50-day bombardment of Gaza in the 2014 massacre. Airstrikes have targeted residential buildings, houses of worship, education facilities and even refugee camps. The Palestine Red Crescent has issued a warning about a ""humanitarian catastrophe unfolding before the world’s eyes with the international community seemingly indifferent to the suffering and plight of the two million civilians in Gaza."" The United Nations has labeled Israel’s battering of Gaza as ethnic cleansing. Moreover, the Israeli government forced more than one million Palestinians from their homes and is administering a complete and total siege of Gaza, cutting off all food, water, power and electricity. Human rights organizations like Amnesty International have asserted that the ""collective punishment"" of civilians constitutes a war crime. Aid was meant to enter Gaza through the Rafah Crossing on the Egyptian border. However, Israel targeted the crossing with airstrikes and rendered it inoperable. Even with civilian Palestinian casualties in the thousands, aid has yet to enter Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned, “It’s only the beginning.” The origin of violenceIn the wake of the recent attacks, politicians have pledged billions of dollars to sanction Israel’s untempered retaliation on Gaza and systematically dehumanized Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, made clear the brutality of what is to come saying, “We are fighting human animals, and we will act accordingly.” U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham told an interviewer, “Level the place.” “Right now, one goal: Nakba! A Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of 48,” Israeli member of Knesset Ariel Kallner declared. You’ll recall Nakba refers to the expulsion of over 750,000 Palestinians in 1948. “I don’t think Israel can be expected to co-exist or find some diplomatic offramp with these savages…They have to be eradicated,” U.S. Senator Marco Rubio argued in response to a question about how Israel should avoid massive casualties of innocent civilians and the roughly one million children in the Gaza Strip. Media and politicians have constructed a rhetorical climate that justifies Palestinian genocide and blatantly fails to contextualize Hamas’ attacks within a broader historical and humanitarian assessment. The narrative that these attacks came “unprovoked” ignores 75 years of well-documented violence and oppression against Palestinians on behalf of the Israeli occupation. There is no excuse for violence against innocent civilians: Just as there is no excuse for the Israeli government’s relentless and indiscriminate bombing of more than 4,200 civilians in Gaza (at the time of writing this) since Oct. 7.Just as there is no excuse for keeping a population of two million people under siege within a confined 25 by six-mile enclave and cutting off their supply of food, water, fuel and electricity. Just as there is no excuse for the numerous, brutal Israeli military campaigns, killing 6,407 Palestinians between 2004 and 2023. Just as there is no excuse for enacting apartheid. Just as there is no excuse for the repeated killings of Palestinian journalists, such as Shireen Abu Akleh in May of 2022 while she was wearing a press vest and reporting on a raid in the West Bank. Just as there is no excuse for the Israeli occupation of internationally recognized Palestinian land and the continued expansion of settlements through the demolition of Palestinian structures and expulsion of its people.Just as many have rightly condemned the violence towards Israeli civilians, we call on them to also condemn the violence towards Palestinian civilians and stop sanctioning their continued battering. Any condemnation of violence against civilians that does not in the same breath condemn Israeli occupation, colonization, settler violence, indiscriminate airstrikes, apartheid and the murder of Palestinian civilians remains hypocritical. The events on Saturday, Oct. 7 were a deadly reaction to millions of Palestinians being killed and placed under indefinite persecution, apartheid and occupation — all of which are legal terms that the U.N. and several human rights organizations have conclusively used to define life under Israel. A people cannot experience this for decades and be expected to never resist or retaliate, and the U.N. protects this right. On the Palestinian people, U.N. Resolution 45/130 “reaffirms the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples for independence, territorial integrity, national unity and liberation from colonial domination, apartheid and foreign occupation by all available means, including armed struggle,” within the bounds of international law. Over the past 75 years, Palestinians have attempted every means of resisting their oppression, including peaceful protests, political lobbying, and financial boycotting (BDS). Every means of protest is met with mass violence and a tightening of apartheid — under a narrative that paints Israel as the victim having the “right to defend itself.” The goal of eradicating Hamas under the veil of “defending itself” does not give Israel a free excuse to carpet bomb Gaza into oblivion. Their history of oppression shows that even when Hamas is not in the picture, case in point the West Bank, Israel continues to kill innocent Palestinian civilians, such as the more than 1,000 Palestinians killed in the West Bank since 2008. Violence begets violence, and as Jewish Voices for Peace explains, the root cause of violence is Israel’s systemic oppression of the Palestinian people. Conclusion Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti proclaimed, “If you want to dispossess a people, the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with, ‘secondly.’” Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie extrapolates, “Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans, and not with the arrival of the British, and you have an entirely different story. Start the story with the failure of the African state and not with the colonial creation of the African state, and you have an entirely different story.”Start with Hamas’ attack and not with Israel’s systemic violence against Palestinians since 1948 and you have an entirely different story. An authentic commitment to peace requires understanding the origins of systemic violence. By providing context, we hope to uncomplicate the so-called “conflict” — internationally recognized as occupation and apartheid against the Palestinian people — and bring the Palestinian story and Palestinian humanity out of the margins."
You are worthy,Luke A. Powery,2023-10-23T04:00:00Z,Oct,23,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102323-powery-you-are-worthy-20231023.html,"I begin with how Dr. Thema Bryant, president of the American Psychological Association, ended her public conversation with me at the 2023 William Preston Few Lecture earlier this month in Duke Chapel. Her final message to the audience that evening was: “You are worthy. You are worthy of care. You are worthy of respect. You are worthy of safety. You are worthy of joy.”This is an absolutely essential message as the world endures the vicious cycle of violence again. These three words — ""you are worthy"" — can be a balm for our souls no matter what bombs explode in our lives. You have worth and value as a human being therefore you should be honored, respected, trusted and included (see Duke’s values). Any act or word of violence is the denial of another person, but to say “you are worthy” is a statement of affirmation.Poet Warsan Shire describes holding a world atlas map on her lap and running her fingers across the whole world. She whispered the question to the world, “Where does it hurt?” and the world answered, “everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.” There is hurt everywhere. But what if we walked around campus and rather than saying “hello” to others, our greeting was “You are worthy”? Rather than hurt, this might offer needed healing.What might that new greeting do to our psyche, our mood, our relationships, our behavior? Perhaps every encounter would become a rendezvous of love rather than one tainted with fear or suspicion of the other. A triple-graduate of Duke, Dr. Bryant researches interpersonal trauma and societal trauma of oppression through the Culture and Trauma Research Lab at Pepperdine University, where she is a professor of psychology. She’s fully aware of the damage done to people through relationships, wars, religions and politics. Trauma can terrorize individuals for their entire lives, so much so that they never seem to triumph over it.Knowing that “you are worthy” might give you the impetus to overcome it. It’s not linguistic magic by any means, but — when one considers the mental health challenges of our time — Bryant said: “The truth is many of us can feel unseen,” she said. “You can walk across campus and feel invisible ... And so the hunger and longing to be known, accepted, appreciated, valued, even missed if you are not present is something that many people, including young people, are missing.” In other words, to tell someone, “You are worthy” could make a difference in that person’s life regardless of who they are or what they’ve done. Saying those words can make someone feel seen and accepted.An important theme for Dr. Bryant, who is a minister in addition to being a professor and clinical psychologist, is homecoming. It is a theme that is beautifully expressed in a famous story (or parable) that Jesus tells in the Bible.There was a man who had two sons. The younger one told his father that he wanted to receive his inheritance early while he was still living. Once he received his share of his family’s wealth, this son traveled to a distant region and squandered all his money. A severe famine took place in that region, so he had to find a job just to eat. He hired himself out to someone who sent him to his field to feed pigs. He was so hungry and desperate that he was willing to eat the pods the pigs were eating. Finally, when he came to his senses, he decided that he would return to his father and say to his father, “I am no longer worthy to be called your son” (Luke 15:19). So, he set off for his home to see his father. “But while he was still far off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him” (Luke 15:20). Instead of condemning his wayward son, the father found the best robe, a ring and sandals to put on his son. And, he requested a fatted calf to eat. The father threw his son a party! Through his extravagant gestures, he showed his son that he was worthy no matter what.Know that you are worthy. So come on home.The Rev. Dr. Luke A. Powery is Dean of Duke University Chapel.

From Barbie to trash bag: Unmasking the horrors of Halloween costumes,Morgan Foster,2023-10-20T04:00:00Z,Oct,20,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102023-foster-halloween-costume-horror-20231020.html,"If you haven't found your Halloween costume yet, don’t panic! I was just at Target the other day, and I think I saw a few Barbie costumes left.I am not a fan of Halloween. I don’t have a Scrooge-like distaste for the holiday; it just doesn’t excite me anymore. I hate shopping for clothes, so why would I find any joy in picking out an outfit for one very specific occasion? I also have no appetite for chemical-laden candy bars filled with ingredients that I can’t even pronounce.(In case you are wondering: Yes, I am fun at parties.)The most recent memory I have of dressing up for Halloween must have been during the early 2010s, when other girls my age were just leaning into their sexuality and arriving at the age where scary and elaborate costumes were no longer “cool.” I, on the other hand, was dressing up as trash. I wish I was lying when I said that I took a trash bag, hot-glue-gunned old food wrappers to the outside, looked in the mirror and gave myself a nod of approval. How my mother let me walk out the door looking like that is a whole other story.Nowadays, I find that my conflict with Halloween has taken on a different meaning. Whenever I stare at blue-collar uniforms that have been over-sexualized by bombshell blonds, all I can think about is waste. Somebody is going to buy that costume, wear it for a handful of hours and then either throw it away or shove it into the depths of their closet, only to see the light of day, years later, when it will then be thrown away.One study estimated that the UK produced about 2000 tonnes (equivalent to 83 million plastic water bottles) worth of waste from Halloween costumes in 2019. Now apply that to the rest of the world every year.I am already a casual crusader of fast fashion, which means I seek to reject the conventional fashion model that relies on low-prices, cheaply constructed clothing and quick-turn-around times. I do this by being intentional when making a new clothing purchase and by shopping second-hand or locally. I do not let myself fall prey to the whims of the fashion trend-buy-repeat cycle. So, for me, Halloween is just fast fashion on steroids — and even that feels like an understatement.Most of those pre-packaged, scratchy costumes are designed to end up in a landfill. They're poorly made, ill-fitted and plain uncomfortable. So yeah, who would want to wear that again? Not to mention the fact that these types of costumes will run you about $60, as reflected by the costs of most of Spirit Halloween's popular costumes. But why does such a sad excuse for clothing cost so much when the make of the garment feels like it should cost a quarter of the price?Unfortunately, it’s not because the makers of that costume are being paid fairly. The disconnect hinges on the fact that the entire commodification of Halloween (and any holiday for that matter) is subject to a short selling season. Retailers like Spirit Halloween and Party City have to squeeze a lot out of those six-ish weeks leading up to Halloween. Any product that doesn’t get sold becomes worthless in a span of 24 hours, resulting in heavily discounted items, thrown-away costumes or packing leftover inventory away for the next season.Because of this, you can see why the cost of Halloween costumes is not proportional to their quality; for the company, the numbers have to make sense. Contrary to regular clothing, companies do not place a purchase order of certain costume styles with the assurance that they can sell through at least most of the stock they order. Seasonal clothing is a gamble subject to the volatility of consumer demand for that costume style. So if, for example, Spirit Halloween doesn’t sell through all their stock of Barbie costumes, at least they had a pretty good profit margin on the ones they did sell.I hope that this Halloween, one less costume is purchased because of this column. I am not saying to not dress up, however; I want to encourage creativity and self-expression. There are plenty of ways to be festive without relying on Target or Sprit Halloween to fill that gap. Although you probably haven’t used Pinterest since 2016, it does have some good inspiration for making your own costumes. In Durham, check out The Scrap Exchange and Scrap Thrift to find good used clothing and decorations.Although the convenience of store-bought costumes may be tempting for a time-crunched college student, this Halloween, do your part to make it a little less scary for the environment.Morgan Foster is a first-year master's student at the Nicholas School for the Environment.

It's okay to feel like you're drowning in headlines,Zubin Rekhi,2023-10-20T04:00:00Z,Oct,20,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102023-rekhi-drowning-headlines-20231020.html,"In light of the Israel-Gaza war, I wanted to digress from my typical discussion of Duke-specific social issues to focus on how we can take care of ourselves in light of the constant barrage of headlines keeping our minds on edge.If, like me, you are addicted to searching for the latest update on your phone, this war can feel overwhelming and tiring. We have dealt with war in Ukraine last year, and we have a Presidential election looming next year. And especially if you have family impacted by the war, it can feel like an obligation to remain well-apprised of every new event taking place. If you are generally politically active or just have strong views about this war, you might also feel obligated to read every article or peruse every politically oriented social media post. Amidst accusations of fake news and deep-seated political biases, it can be exhausting to constantly think about the war. Yet, at the same time, it is impossible not to.I’m here to tell you that it’s fine to not watch news footage or read another New York Times article about the war.Stepping back is taking care of yourself. Making a false tradeoff between neglecting your mental health and somehow neglecting war victims — even if they are close family members — by choosing not to read the latest headline is unsustainable.Some people will say that my advice amounts to sticking your head in the sand because ignorance is bliss. They might think that it plays into the evil narrative and misinformation serving as the original intent behind the attacks and detracts from justice. That’s why, they suggest, it’s important for even children to see gut-wrenching photos: to know the scale of depravity that occurred and say never again instead of repeating the mistakes of their predecessors.I agree that eventually, we should all process what has just happened because too often our memories have lapsed at critical junctures and we have repeated the same mistakes time and again in history. But it’s okay to digest this war at your own pace and to do so when you are ready, not when a pushy news commentator says so.And if you are feeling stressed out by this war — even if friends and family are safe — you are not alone. Your stress is legitimate.Breaking news-fueled stress is relatively commonplace in America. The American Psychological Association defines “headline stress” as negative news coverage harming one’s mental and physical health through “intrusive thoughts about news articles or current events throughout the day” and “persistent anger, resentment, or anxiety generated by reading news articles.” At the core of “headline stress” lies an individual’s powerlessness about the distressing situation that affects them but that they cannot control.You probably feel stressed knowing that you have no power over the actions of Hamas or the Israeli government. It’s the feeling that all you can do is sit back and watch and hear horror stories that gets you addicted to the news apps and platforms on your phone.But putting down your phone helps. The American Psychological Association also points out that turning off news notifications on your phone or setting a timer to limit upsetting social media content helps. If you feel powerless, channeling your time and effort away from your news feed and into a positive action — such as donating or raising money for a cause you care about adjacent to the war — can help.Being able to say “I can’t” when you scroll through family group chats full of clickbait or news platforms is not only okay but also good for you. Moving at your own pace is your right. Moving at someone else’s is not an obligation worth stress about fulfilling.Zubin Rekhi is a Trinity sophomore. His column typically runs on alternate Fridays."
My future is not for sale,Marie-Hélène Tomé,2023-10-20T04:00:00Z,Oct,20,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/102023-tome-duke-divestment-climate-20231020.html,"It is July, a month once filled with those perfect, seemingly endless midsummer days. But today the sky is an orange haze. Within seconds of stepping outside, the smoky air burns your throat, and the fine particles clog your lungs. No, I am not pitching a post-apocalyptic Netflix show, although reading the headlines — wildfires in Hawaii, massive rains flooding the NYC transportation network leading to physical altercations for room on overcrowded subways, temperatures over 110 degrees Fahrenheit in Arizona — makes it sound like we are living in one. I am describing scenes from daily life in the Northeast this summer as smoke from the Canadian wildfires made the outside air unbreathable. This is our new reality, and it only gets worse from here. The good news is that we all have the power to change the script, so let’s pitch a new ending. I am claiming the right to clean air. I am claiming the right to government policy addressing climate change. I am claiming the right to a future, and you should too.It may seem like the antagonists in this show are the likes of Chevron, BP, ExxonMobil and Shell — companies which are spending $200 million a year lobbying government to deprive us of these rights. And yes, these companies have a history of obfuscating their role in the climate crisis, accelerating climate change by increasing CO2 emissions and using the profits they earn at our collective expense to actively block viable policy solutions to the climate emergency and double down on their investment in fossil fuels. But Duke also plays a significant role. By selling its institutional clout to the fossil fuel industry in the form of investing in fossil fuels and accepting donations from and publishing research funded by fossil fuel companies and climate denial foundations, Duke is giving legitimacy to their false claims of equity and sustainability and growing their political and economic clout.In 2022, Chevron and ExxonMobil were sponsors of Duke’s Energy Conference during Energy Week. ExxonMobil recently executed a $59.6 billion dollar acquisition that will more than double its current oil production operations in Texas. These companies are betting that fossil fuels are the future. By allowing them to be a part of our campus, we are providing them a with platform for sanitizing their image and spreading greenwashing disinformation. In failing to speak out, we are giving our tacit consent to growing their power. If we continue to remain silent, we are complicit. If we fail to take individual and collective action, we have no one to blame for the climate crisis except ourselves.We don’t have the time to let Duke stall. We don’t have time to admire the problem in seminar series discussing Duke’s obligation to invest morally. We need climate action. And that begins with dissociation. Duke cannot make a climate commitment and at the same time fail to do its part to address the systemic issues blocking climate policy. Duke must hold these companies accountable for their role in accelerating climate change and strip them of institutional backing.Dissociation is not a silver bullet. It’s a prerequisite to climate action. Other issues will arise because of making these changes. For instance, how should scientists at Duke University find alternative funding if they are no longer allowed to accept funding from fossil fuel corporations? But these challenges are not arguments for maintaining the status quo. Change is always difficult, yet it presents us an opportunity to develop innovative policy solutions to increase the sustainability of our campus and to make our university a place we are proud to call home. Climate change is a complicated issue, and there are no quick fixes. There is just a lot of hard work, and that’s where we come in.Dissociation from fossil fuel companies may seem “granola” or like something you’d agree might be beneficial but wouldn’t actively fight for. Maybe you think it’s hopeless to strive for broad institutional change. The recent success of the student-led Sunrise Movement in getting New York University to divest, however, shows that grassroots student activism can lead to institutional change. This story can have a more hopeful ending than the headlines currently suggest. Young people around the world are coming together to save our planet. Here on campus, the Duke Climate Coalition is leading a Fossil Free Research Day of action on Oct. 27.Unless they fundamentally change their business model, fossil fuel corporations have no place in a sustainable future, and they should have no place on our campus. Maybe you think your time is better invested doing something else. Let me ask you this: Is your future worth fighting for?Marie-Hélène Tomé is a Trinity junior and a member of the Duke Climate Coalition."
Mirror mirror on the wall,Advikaa Anand,2023-10-19T04:00:00Z,Oct,19,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101923-anand-mirror-mirror-on-the-wall-20231019.html,"Do you remember the first time you were struck by your own reflection staring back at you in the mirror?I do.My first mirror hung by the shelves that held my toys. It was purple and speckled with glitter and shaped like an oval with tiara-like spikes at its crown. When I gazed into its glass, it seemed as though the crown sat regally upon my own head. I often wondered about the girl staring back at me in this mirror. Was she an alternate version of me in another reality? Was the bed behind her and the ceiling above her as real as the ones in my room?As I grew older, my odd relationship with mirrors persisted. Although I now knew that mirrors were not portals to alternate realities, I could not shake off my fascination. I can recall an awkward situation during a visit to a family friend’s house, where a mirror was hanging right before me and the sight of my own reflection stupefied me. Who was this person?The friends perceived my tendency as indicative of an odd hubris — a Greek term for pride. But what they failed to understand was that a mirror presents a rare opportunity for us to actually see ourselves. Although we know ourselves better than anyone else, we have seen ourselves only through pictures and cameras and mirrors. We are fascinated by this person because we want to know them, to understand them and most importantly, evaluate them. How, then, do we decide the worthiness of the person in the mirror — do we hinge our value upon what we have accomplished? Or who we are?I have tussled with this dilemma for a long time: my sense of self-worth often fluctuates with the ups and downs of my daily life, especially at a highly competitive school like Duke University, which places immense emphasis on the accomplishments inscribed in our resume. Did I get a good grade on that hard exam that I studied weeks for? Did I bag that coveted internship? What prestigious clubs am I a part of?Yet, I forget that these lenses are often liars. Pictures and cameras and mirrors are no objective reporters of the truth, capturing all details we could wish to know about ourselves. Instead, they reflect back versions of ourselves that are often distorted by human perceptions of what we should value: accomplishments, appearances and other quantifiable assets. If others have told us that our talent for writing beautiful poetry is inspiring, then we gaze at our hands, marveling at the magic they have manufactured. If others have told us instead that our poetic abilities are a waste, providing us with no useful skills in the real world, then we fixate upon our hands, wishing they are more adept at coding or solving economic derivatives. If others have told us that the crooked shape of our teeth makes our smile more charming, then we gaze at our smile, gratified. If others have told us instead that our crooked teeth make us appear menacing, then we fixate upon our smile, contemplating a decision to invest in Invisalign or braces. How we respond to these thoughts when we look into the mirror, however, is more telling of ourselves than others. Do we have high self-confidence? Low self-confidence? High self-esteem? Low self-esteem? Do we possess an internal locus of self-worth, where our trust and value in ourselves reigns supreme? Or is our self-image contingent upon an external locus of self-worth — how much we trust and value how others view us.I have often found myself lurking in the second category. And my external locus of self-worth has a gaping flaw: it plummets when things don’t go well.And often, they don’t. What do I do then?Our world has made us wary of excessive hubris — and for good reason. Arrogance is associated with a dangerous host of other behaviors, including violence, carelessness and a general sense of cruelty. But taking pride in our best qualities – traits that cannot be traced to any tangible outcome, such as our kindness, our humor and our compassion — is not a bad thing; our inherent value is not contingent on some sense of human “capital.”It’s reductive to presume that our value is linked only to what we can create or produce. Instead, we ought to prioritize our daily impact on the people around us — how do we make them feel? How did we react when our friend was helpless and in pain? Did we conduct ourselves with grace and dignity when we were in a position of power?So look into the mirror as you embark upon the treacherous journey of discovering who you really are — after all, this is the only way you can really see yourself. Only be wary of the voices singing in your head when you do and what they say to you.Listen, instead, to the quiet beat of your heart within — the one that brings joy to those who cannot live without you. Because we are all beautiful when we see ourselves through the eyes of those who love us.Advikaa Anand in a Trinity sophomore. Her columns typically run on alternating Thursdays."
How to rethink your friendships,Jess Jiang,2023-10-18T04:00:00Z,Oct,18,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101823-jiang-rethinking-friendships-20231018.html,"This just in: You’ve been doing friendship wrong, whatever your friendship style. The fact that you have friends at all? My condolences. Instead of categorizing all the friends you have, today’s article is all about making you uncomfortable. Today, we categorize you by the number of friends you have and the type of relationship you have with your friends and find you wanting. Here are eight types of friendship styles that may apply to you:The COVID-19 wannabeYou took that Bumble BFF poster that was up at the beginning of the semester in West Union dining hall — about how 17,000 people are arriving on campus and how you’re bound to find some friends within them — a little too seriously. Instead of realizing the poster meant that you’d find a few friends out of 17,000, you somehow thought it was a good idea to infect all 17,000-odd people at Duke with your cheerful presence. No one escapes you, except those of us who live in the library, common rooms or dorms and come out once every fifteen years like periodical cicadas. 2. The Pre-ProfessionalYou’ve got your life figured out, and by life, you mean career. The first time you stepped on campus as a first-year, you were heading to the Career Center to check over your resume (yes, it’s a thing!). You don’t have friends, you have a portfolio of strategic investments in individuals. You set up your LinkedIn account in kindergarten and this is what you use, instead of Snapchat or messages, to ask your strategic investments to lunch conferences at WU.Which is great! Ideally, you enjoy the company of your carbon-based strategic investments and make time regularly to be a real person in addition to a high-achieving, future-focused pre-professional. But it’s always good to take advantage of resources if you’re able to and have the time to, especially if they may benefit you in the future. If you’re interested in learning about undergraduate student resources and how first-years last year used campus resources and amenities, check out the Center for Documentary Studies’ list of undergraduate student resources and this Chronicle article on how well Duke’s campus resources and amenities are known and used by the Class of 2025.3. The Friend Group Person Defined as someone with a group of friends who all know each other. That’s awful! I mean, not only do you have friends, but your friends are friends with each other? That’s so many kinds of wrong.4. The 10,000 Friends on Social Media PersonNot everyone who uses social media falls into this category, but you know you’re here when you start to tell yourself with increasing desperation that you definitely don’t base your self-worth on the number of likes your posts get and that you definitely feel fulfilled by socializing primarily through little text bubbles and pictures.Social media is not unilaterally bad: It can be a good way to find community and stay connected to friends. I don’t have Instagram, I wouldn’t know. One of my Fairly Reliable, Interdependent Entities with whom I Non-competitively Debate on a daily to monthly basis does. They say that it’s a good way to learn what events are happening on campus and to be vaguely reminded that friends, acquaintances and famous people exist. But if you suspect that social media is detracting from your composite digital and non-digital experience of the virtual reality we call life, consider turning notifications off of your social media apps for a day. I dare you, it’s not impossible. Side effects do exist, however, and may include being jump-scared by how blue the sky is and feeling like you have time-traveled back to 15th-century rural peasant life. If you can believe it, some people actually live without checking their phones every five minutes and have survived to tell the tale.5. The Unfortunate OneYou make friends everywhere you go. Going to class? New friends. Hanging out anywhere? New friends. Leaving your room to go to the bathroom down the hall? New friends. You’re becoming concerned. Something’s not quite right. No one believes you when you say you have too many friends. Someone make it stop already. 6. The GardenerPeople are basically plants, right? You make sure they get enough sun, water them regularly, and give them pep talks when they’re looking a little droopy — that’s all there is to it.You’ve been doing this regularly and have strangely not been able to harvest any fruits or vegetables from your friends. Instead, your friends bring you conversation and support and have extended all over your carefully scheduled calendar. Real plants are better than humans: Ditch those friends and check out Duke Farm.7. The TherapistYou don’t have friends, you have therapy clients who don’t pay you. Your friend just bombed their midterm? Someone’s pet guppy just died? The drying machines in Few Quad caught fire again? Yep, your phone just started ringing.If I were you, I would start charging for services. But if you actually enjoy counseling people, consider doing so as part of an organization, such as becoming a peer support operator at a Duke-specific line or at a more general support line. Direct your friends to CAPS. Or direct yourself to CAPS — it may be hard to reach out, but it’s okay to not be okay, even for seemingly trivial little things. It’s difficult to help others when your needs aren’t being addressed.8. The Friend-Free PersonIf you’re not lonely and quite happy with your life, then congratulations: You’re perhaps the only person who’s doing this friendship thing right. Friends? Who needs those? Thankfully, you are a superior life form not dependent on base physical needs, like the presence of another human being, to maintain your happiness and efficiency. But sometimes it happens that there’s simply nobody that you click with, no matter how hard you’ve looked.You may prefer to have one close friend than many acquaintances. It may be that you don’t make any friends in college — and that’s okay, unless it bothers you. Though friends do affect your well-being, you can be happy without friends. You can be busy, talk to people, lean into other support systems and succeed at what you do. On the other hand, not all of us have the willpower to control our baser urges for friendship. If you’d like to make friends, feel lonely, or haven’t been very social, then consider rescuing Number 5 above (the Unfortunate One). They’re at Abele Quad in front of the Duke Chapel trying to get into the C1 bus, currently trapped at the very bottom of a pile of people and shouting for help. They could use a hand and a partner to share the burden of having so many friends.If you are feeling lonely, it can be good to make casual conversation with people you don’t know well. Even small gestures, like smiling at someone during a brief interaction, are meaningful. Sometimes it may help to look in different places: I have met all but one of my Duke friends through a club. What clubs, events and groups could you join? If you’re not that social, that’s fine. I do think that having a few friends you spend time with is fun, and meeting new people is fun, but if you’ve realized that you’re more of a hermit, then good for you! And if you simply are going through it right now, I truly hope it gets better. Unless you’re truly a superior life form, though, you will unfortunately likely end up having at least one friend. There’s no helping it, I suppose: You’re only human.Jess Jiang is a Trinity senior who wrote this satirical piece to make Duke students even more anxious about their social lives.

Pro-Palestine student groups need to condemn Hamas' atrocities,Kraz Greinetz,2023-10-17T04:00:00Z,Oct,17,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101723-greinetz-palestine-student-groups-condemn-need-20231017.html,"Over the last week, pro-Palestine groups on college campuses have missed the mark badly. Groups at a variety of schools released statements on the ongoing violence between Hamas and Israel. While these statements vary, most hit on a couple key points. Almost all lay the blame for the fighting solely at the feet of Israel and point to the suffering Palestinians have had to endure as the cause of the violence. But these arguments are nothing more than a shameful deflection that misses the point. Since Oct. 7, Hamas has:Massacred over 250 young people attending a music festival. Murdered 112 residents of Be’eri Kibbutz — over 10% of its population.Filmed its execution of an elderly woman in her apartment and uploaded the footage to social media.This is far from an exhaustive list. In total, Hamas killed over 1,200 people. In the vast majority of cases, these deaths were the result of planned, deliberate massacres by Hamas in towns far away from Israeli military bases. Hamas fighters often rampage door to door looking for victims to kidnap, rape and kill. Who is to blame for the broader conflict is irrelevant. No matter the answer, groups should condemn these atrocities. Even if Israel shoulders all of the blame, and even if armed Palestinian resistance is justified, neither of those things mean that Hamas needs to engage in a campaign of mass murder against civilians who don’t live near any legitimate military targets. No campaign of liberation, no matter how righteous, needs the blood of sick and elderly civilians as fuel. But pro-Palestine campus groups have ignored this broader context. Instead, they often list Israel’s supposed sins, making no mention at all of Hamas’ actions. Some even explicitly praise last weekend’s events as an act of justified “resistance.” Of course, none directly defend the atrocities, but the message is still clear. By speaking only about Israel’s wrongdoing, or using the violence as a chance to endorse the general idea of armed resistance, activist groups treat everything that happened, atrocities included, as a justified part of the Palestinian struggle for liberation. A necessary evil Israel brought on itself. But no matter how much these groups pretend otherwise, Hamas killed civilians because it wantedto. These murders served no military purpose. Hamas killed civilians because it thought they deserved to die. So even if pro-Palestine campus groups are right about the conflict, it still wouldn’t excuse what happened. And their refusal to condemn even the most grotesque of atrocities shows that they’re not interested in actually building a political movement that can end the conflict. And some statements go beyond just “missing the point.” For example, multipleschools’ Students for Justice in Palestine chapters praised Hamas for seizing Israeli “settlements.” The cities attacked by Hamas, however, are within Israel’s pre-1967 borders, borders that even Hamas accepts as permanent parts of Israel. Some of these statements then went on to claim that every resident of a settlement “is a soldier.” The implication is obvious – Hamas didn’t kill civilians because there’s no such thing as an Israeli civilian. Combined with calls to liberate Palestine “from the river to the sea,” by force if necessary, it’s hard not to see these statements as declaring all six million Israeli Jews military targets. This should have been easy for campus activist groups. Hamas makes no secret about its desire to carry out a Middle East re-enactment of the Holocaust. Its leaders have repeatedly called the European Holocaust a “lie invented by Zionists.” And it has also called for a renewed Holocaust against Jews. Its founding document states, “Our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious ... The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews).” One Hamas lawmaker said that “the Holocaust is still to come upon the Jews.” Even if these campus groups are correct, for example, that Gaza is an open-air prison and that Israel’s occupation has fueled Hamas’ rise to power, that doesn’t mean that these groups, made up of college students based in the United States, have to voice support for every action Hamas takes. Yes, politics is messy, and advocacy groups often have to work with people they disagree with. But by refusing to ever condemn Hamas’ actions, pro-Palestine groups don’t show solidarity; they show a lack of ability to see nuance or complexity. But why does this matter? After all, statements from student groups aren’t usually groundbreaking political events. It matters because the pro-Palestine movement, more than other movements, relies on young people, especially on campuses, to be the bulwark of its activism. Anti-Israel views are concentrated among Americans under the age of 30. And during the recent violence, the main groups to express support for the Palestinian cause have either been campus-based groups or the Democratic Socialists of America — both of which are made up of mostly (or entirely) young people.So these statements aren’t just wrong — they reveal a deeper truth about why pro-Palestine activists have struggled to change U.S. policy towards Israel. It shouldn’t be hard to condemn a group of Holocaust deniers that films themselves executing civilians. And condemning Hamas’ massacres doesn’t contradict these groups’ position that Israel is an apartheid state perpetuating the conflict. Nor would it preclude them from condemning future Israeli actions. But almost none even mentioned the dead Israeli civilians. As long as pro-Palestine groups on campuses continue to treat civilian massacres as an inevitable part of the fight for liberation, Israelis and most American Jews will continue to view its cause as a fundamental threat to the lives of all six million Jews living in Israel. And until these groups change how they talk about events like this, Jews in both countries will continue to view it as a movement interested in violence, not peace.

A simple future Trinity curriculum,Angikar Ghosal,2023-10-16T03:55:00Z,Oct,16,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101623-ghosal-future-trinity-cirriculum-20231016.html,"The Academic Council is currently formulating a new pedagogical framework for Trinity College, complete with freshly designed requisites for general education that will replace the existing Curriculum 2000 benchmarks. Such pedagogical transformations frequently necessitate a back-and-forth, where conflicting perspectives about Duke students among various departments must eventually reach a compromise. Let me present my view — one which I believe to be impartial in its applicability across diverse departments and efficacious in how it addresses present-day needs.I appreciate the current Areas of Knowledge requisites, and I extend my gratitude to the Research and Writing Modes of Inquiry. However, I am inclined to say that certain other Modes of Inquiry do a disservice to the student body. Presently, owing to the capacity of a solitary course to fulfill the criteria of multiple Modes of Inquiry, students are incentivized to go on a treasure hunt in the course catalog for classes that amalgamate in one course a ‘gen-ed code’ of Cross-Cultural Inquiry (CCI) and Ethical Inquiry (EI) within the areas of Social Sciences (SS) or Arts, Literature, Performance (ALP). This means students are less likely to choose courses purely driven by their personal intellectual interests. Astonishingly, a lot of esteemed professors, usually older, have yet to optimize their course nomenclature to encompass a greater number of these holy grails known as Trinity codes. I believe that if they were to ornament their courses with these Trinity codes, the enrollment figures for their courses would experience a substantial increase. The current setup tends to lead to a proliferation of certain interdisciplinary course offerings cross-listed in several departments. This leads to students getting disincentivized to take courses in one single department that suffer the penury of merely one Area of Knowledge.Additionally, the structure of the Areas of Knowledge framework fails to encapsulate the multifarious breadth of academia. A student who satisfies their Social Sciences credits by just taking two courses in Economics is scarcely afforded a sufficiently panoramic perspective of the various social sciences and their methodologies. Similarly, a student who exclusively enrolls in Biology courses to satisfy Natural Sciences credits will get to experience very little of the extent of natural sciences; what about classical mechanics?I propose the implementation of a more lucid system that reveals the full expanse of academic offerings at Duke University and thereby mitigates the aforementioned inadequacies.In my proposal, each student must enroll in at least one course within each of the following departmental combinations, including cross-listed courses. Note that no single course may concurrently satisfy the requirements of more than one departmental combination. Several departments appear multiple times, allowing one to take multiple courses in that department to fulfill the requisites of the corresponding sets. The exact demarcation of the sets is merely illustrative and may be reshuffled at Duke’s discretion.Set 1: History, AAAS, Religion, Classics. Examining the significance of our historical continuum and cultural heritage serves as the crux of this set.Set 2: Art & Art History, Dance, Music, Theater Studies, VMS, English. The focus of this set is to look at the myriad of human artistic expressions. Set 3: English, Literature, Classics, Philosophy. Delving into the written word as an instrument of profound significance in the realm of liberal arts is the theme of this set.Set 4: Slavic & Eurasian Studies, Romance Studies, German Studies, ICS, AMES: Acquainting oneself with the intricacies of a specific culture is the overarching objective here.Set 5: Economics, Political Science, Philosophy, Public Policy: Scrutinizing society through the lens of individual preferences, ideologies and utilitarian calculus stands as the focal point of this set.Set 6: Psychology, Sociology, Cultural Anthropology, GSF, Linguistics. Examining societal dynamics from a vantage point that encompasses broader, structural and systemic trends constitutes this set.Set 7: Computer Science, Statistics. Students acquire proficiency in analyzing the world through the lens of numerical data, thereby attaining computational fluency to a certain degree.Set 8: Physics, Mathematics, any Engineering. The pure quantitative sciences, where mathematical rigor and scientific inquiry merge.Set 9: Chemistry, Physics, Biology. The foundational bedrock of the natural sciences involving empirical investigation.Set 10: Biology, Neuroscience, Evolutionary Anthropology, Earth & Climate Science, Environmental Science. The biological sciences serve as the focal point of this set, studying the complexities of life, evolution and the environment.Sets 5 and 6 are a good replacement for existing Social Sciences requirements, sets 7 and 8 are a good replacement for existing Quantitative Sciences requirements and sets 9 and 10 are a good replacement for existing Natural Sciences requirements. Furthermore, Set 10 means every student takes one class that is related to biodiversity and climate change without an explicit climate change coursework requirement.The current paradigm necessitates two courses for each of the Areas of Knowledge, meaning students must take a minimum of 10 courses to satisfy the current general education requirement, and the minimum number of courses needed does not change under this system. Consequently, this new system would not increase the requirements for achieving a comprehensive breadth of education. It also ensures that students get to explore as many departments as possible.I also propose abolishing Modes of Inquiry requirements. While it is true that cross-cultural inquiry and ethical inquiry are important, cross-cultural inquiry is implicit when you take a class in Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and ethical introspection is implicit when you take a political science class. Modes of Inquiry engender some classes more equal than others — it makes a class on techno-humanities likely to engender more interest than a class on Faulkner, and makes a class on societal applications of data science more lucrative to take than a class on theoretical foundations of statistics. Classes in AAAS already make students study the after-effects of racism and slavery; hence it is already obvious that a class in AAAS makes students think critically — it does not need a Dukehub tag separately certifying critical thinking.I do agree that the Writing and the Seminar/Independent Study requirements are valuable, and I will keep those requirements unchanged. Note that with the plethora of seminars offered in every department and the extent to which Duke undergraduates tend to do research of their own choice, these requirements are nowhere near burdensome. A well-designed liberal arts curriculum should be one where liberal arts students enjoying and exploring liberal arts naturally finish them, without even checking the ‘Degree Progress’ tab on Dukehub.We have observed that the campus community has bifurcated, with STEM students exhibiting a disdainful attitude toward the humanities, and humanities students feeling alienated on a predominantly pre-professional, STEM-centric campus.A rudimentary measure to ameliorate this schism comes if students gain a holistic appreciation for the expansive realm of liberal arts and sciences, wherein the intrinsic value of each academic department's contribution to the corpus of human cognition is acknowledged.Additionally, the hope is that students shall cultivate a more healthy disposition toward their course selections, exploring a particular subject to determine which subtopic is of most interest rather than unilaterally prioritizing courses with three or more codes.Of course, I do not consider this proposal infallible, and further comments are welcome.Angikar Ghosal is a trinity senior.

Tribute to Angela Risi: 'I thought we were going to be friends for a long time',Brooks Emanuel,2023-10-15T11:18:00Z,Oct,15,Letters To The Editor,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101523-emanuel-angela-risi-tribute-20231015.html,"Angela was a good friend, both in that I considered her a close friend and in that she was good at being a friend. She cared about friendship and community. Part of why we connected was that, I think, we were both very extroverted and thrived on connection. Being in my second year and in the depths of my thesis work while she was in her first year, I didn’t get to see her as much as I wanted to. I remember her saying she felt isolated because people had so little time to spend together. I deeply related to that sentiment, feeling that our current culture is often deeply isolating. One thing I loved most about Angela is that, in opposition to this, she was constantly cultivating community. Very quickly after getting to Durham, she knew a lot of people. Rather than staying in a grad school bubble, she had friends from all over the Durham community. We ended up with local friends in common, strengthening my feeling that we were kin.And when we did spend time together, it was wonderful, and I felt embraced and free. We danced together at parties, showing out with a crowd gathering around us. At an art opening where she was performing, she got me onto the floor with her for an impromptu improv. I often get shy when people try to get me to dance on demand, but I didn’t with her. It just always felt good. And I never hesitated. It just flowed. Maybe it’s because she seemed to be so fully, unselfconsciously and unabashedly herself that she inspired me to be too. I’m not sure there’s a better measure of friendship than helping us be more truly ourselves. Angela did that for me.Things feel a bit of a blur now, but Angela was a good friend — someone who I just really, really liked and loved to be around. I thought we were going to be friends for a long time. She affirmed me personally, and through the way she carried herself in the world — the politics and ethics of her being — she affirmed the humanity of everyone she came across.

Letter from alumni: Duke leadership needs new direction,Jim Kruidenier,2023-10-13T04:30:00Z,Oct,13,Opinion,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101323-kruidenier-alumni-letter-duke-leadership-20231013.html,"We write as alumni of Duke University to urge the leadership to set goals that lead to fair and equitable employment practices, sustainable environmental policy and responsible investment strategies. Many of us are women and men who arrived on campus in the 1960s and 1970s. During that tumultuous period, we learned values in the classroom and the larger Durham community that shaped our lives and led to decades of social and political activism.This letter was stimulated in part by theNew York Times Magazine article about the important issue of the lack of economic diversity at Duke, an issue we will address in a separate letter.Today we marvel at the accomplishments of the university, and we credit it with important developments that have changed the lives of hundreds of thousands. Nonetheless, we believe that Duke's current direction is at odds with the best of its history and the needs of our community and nation. The time has come for change.Duke needs leadership to embrace goals that improve all levels of university life at Duke, including fair employee relations, sustainable campus environmental policies and investment strategies that are sensitive to the perils of global warming and climate change. Fair employment practicesDuke has long reinforced community and regional inequality and division through its enduring hostility to labor unions. Campus workers now represented by AFSCME Local 77 originally achieved representation through their own courage and the university-wide shutdown caused by the Vigil of 1968. They faced near-intractable opposition to collective bargaining from University trustees with ties to the textile and tobacco industries. Local 77’s victory is an enduring monument to the achievement of social justice through collaborations across class, race and gender. Despite this triumph, Duke has continued to act in ways that differ little from other union-busting conservative and right-wing businesses. In 1992, for example, the school entered negotiations with its bus drivers and transportation staff (ATU, Local 1328) only when compelled to do so by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Afterward, Duke reluctantly recognized the University Press Workers and the Graduate Student Union only after the NLRB again took action. At Duke Hospital — despite organizing efforts beginning as far back as 1970 — no group of employees has gained recognition as a bargaining unit in the face of management's implacable opposition. In comparison, unions are strong at other premier teaching and research hospitals, such as the Massachusetts General/Brigham system (Boston) and the Yale New Haven Hospital (Connecticut). Duke's enduring hostility to organized labor has undermined efforts to achieve economic equality and fair treatment of working people. Environmental policiesThe current Duke administration's approach to environmental issues reflects a similar reluctance to promote real change and grapple with issues of social justice. Duke is home to a world-renowned school of environmental policy, where scholars frequently describe the dire effects of a corporate order based on the hyper-exploitation of resources and environmental destruction. Yet Duke has embraced a financial structure that underwrites these very catastrophes.The very foundations of Duke were at odds with responsible approaches to the environment and pollution. The University was built in part with income from the company now known as Duke Energy, which today is one of the largest polluters and producers of planet-warming gases in the country. The administration refuses to state how much income the school now receives from Duke Energy through its endowment, and Duke Energy's financial statements only include financial investment funds in its lists of large shareholders. This lack of transparency raises serious questions about the degree to which Duke University is intertwined with a corporation that consistently sees short-term financial gain as more important than the communities it serves. Global warming and damaging pollution are sustained, in part, by institutional investors who look the other way. We are unable to tell whether Duke is one of them. This lack of candor from Duke occurs while Harvard, Princeton, Columbia, Georgetown, USC and dozens of other major universities have divested from or are committed to divesting from fossil fuel corporations. Duke’s commitment to achieving a carbon-neutral campus this decade sounds good, but much of the plan to achieve this goal remains too opaque to evaluate. Even at its best, the carbon-neutral initiative does not excuse Duke's abrupt refusal to continue its support of the Durham-Orange Light Rail Project in 2019. After years of cooperation with this effort to lessen automobile traffic between Durham and Chapel Hill, Duke raised a series of objections. It even proposed running the rail line through the historically African-American Crest Street neighborhood. It then refused to enter a mediated negotiation of these issues. This show of bad faith ended the project and significantly undermined the city's efforts to combat climate change at the local level and build more affordable housing.Again, the time has come for change. The Duke University Board of Trustees and Administration should take concrete steps to create a more equitable, just and sustainable community.Duke University should cease its opposition to other unionization efforts by Duke's workers, including the unionization of Duke Hospital and Medical Center workers, recognizing the improvements in productivity and quality of life that its workers and the entire University community will gain.Duke should promptly negotiate in good faith and sign a contract with the Duke Graduate Student Union (DGSU) that includes a year-round stipend in the very reasonable amount called for by the DGSU.Duke should provide specific metrics by which the progress of the carbon-neutral initiative can be monitored and assessed.Duke should engage with the Durham community to promote efforts to fight global warming and environmental injustices. Duke should report the income its endowment receives from Duke Energy.Duke should develop a strategy to divest itself in the near future of all investments in fossil fuels and should report its strategy to the university and Durham communities.Each journey begins with a series of individual steps. We look forward to hearing from Duke about the steps that it will take to improve the lives of university workers, its relations with the Durham community and its impact on the global climate crisis.Signed on behalf of concerned alumni at Duke University,Jim Kruidenier '71 Additional Signatories Below:Ninian Beall '68Andy Berlin ‘72David Birkhead '69 (former editor-in-chief of The Chronicle)John Charles Boger '68Bill Boyarsky '69BJ Spinelli Boyarsky '68Gail Boyarsky '73Rose Boyarsky '68Sam Boyarsky '01Harry Boyte '67Julia Borbely-Brown '70Sallie Brown '71Ann Bushyhead '73Tom Campbell '70 (former editor-in-chief of The Chronicle)Candace Carraway '72Jean M.

Tribute to Angela Risi: 'We were together for nine years',Marissa Arriaga,2023-10-13T04:15:00Z,Oct,13,Letters To The Editor,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101323-arriaga-angela-risi-tribute-20231013.html,"I was married to Angela Risi for a short time; we were together for nine years. I met her in San Diego and moved to Chicago with her where we started a wholesome and loving life together. We moved to Durham last year and unfortunately separated shortly after, but she was always on my mind.She was such a kind soul with a passion for movement and music. She changed me in so many positive ways, and my family doesn’t let me forget it. I miss her laugh, her silly jokes and her dancing and twirling around the house. She was such an important part of my family, and the emptiness will be felt for the rest of our lives. She brought so much joy, brightness and warmth into my life. It is difficult to imagine this world without Angela shining like she did so well. I left Durham with a hole in my heart, and it has grown since her passing. I know she was loved by many, which makes me happy to know she had a supportive community of friends and chosen family in Durham. All of our friends and family in Chicago, San Diego and beyond loved her so much and were devastated by the news on Oct. 2.Angela deserved to live a long life. I will cherish the years of memories we have together and try to emulate her brightness in my everyday life. Angela will be missed forever, and I will never stop loving her. I hope that Duke University and the city of Durham can work together do more to bring safety to communities and prevent gun violence. I hope that this tragedy can bring change in some way. Ang would have wanted that. I love and miss you, Angela.Marissa Arriaga is a student at the Tamarind Institute at the University of New Mexico."
Seeking quiet in an age of information,Susan Chemmanoor,2023-10-13T04:00:00Z,Oct,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101323-chemmanoor-seeking-quiet-information-age-20231013.html,"I have nothing against information, but we simply get too much of it. We’re constantly getting answers to questions we’ve never asked. I don’t lay awake at night wondering which plastic surgery trend is the hottest, but my phone thinks I do. Every minute, I’m being fed neverending spam emails, coverage on Twitter fan wars, ads for the newest weight-loss drug and memes about Kylie Jenner and Timothee Chalamet. The sea of absolute irrelevancy is harmful. I’ve gotten so used to consuming mammoth amounts of shallow information, I can’t even discern what information is important or accurate anymore. And that’s by design.As soon as the telegraph was invented, information had to be boiled down to its most eye-catching and valuable parts. It birthed a communication system that values efficiency over necessary context. Information became oversimplified in a quest for swiftness of delivery. Think about print newspapers and their fear-mongering political headlines, all information that didn’t make your heart drop lost its value. A plethora of flashy headlines deprived of necessary context became a norm still existing today. Short-form content takes this oversimplification to a new level. The modern exchange of information values quantity, not quality. Information is a commodity, and we are buying it in bulk. But that was supposed to be a good thing. The whole point of improved information exchange was to make us more informed. The weird part is that the current constant barrage of information isn’t even working. Being inundated with knowledge should’ve made us smarter, but it didn’t. It only created a system that hinges on promoting the illusion of being informed while actually knowing very little. It’s a sort of “jack of all trades” mindset. Why should we be thoroughly informed on one issue when we could feel like experts on every issue? It’s what allows us to feel informed about the world when we use a buzzword that we learned on TikTok from a serious-seeming guy in front of a 4K camera. So, we know a little bit about everything. Beyond oversimplification, why is that bad? I don’t have a concrete answer, but I believe it has something to do with how an excess of information can deprive us of our capacity to act. After I read my 40th article or watch my 70th TikTok about a certain world issue, what am I supposed to do with that? How do I take action while feeling overwhelmed? How can I act when I’m so tired of trying to figure out which person I should listen to? An infinite library of resources can easily paralyze us in a constant state of being afraid to have an opinion and thus never actually fixing any issues.That’s the more “academic” side of this argument. Let’s talk about the personal.An overabundance of stimulation can creep into the very fabric of our value system by simply being enjoyable. It’s entertaining to constantly be stimulated. Anything that’s “boring” immediately loses its value. And since we have such easy access to entertainment all the time, we expect it all the time. From the moment we wake up, to the time we close our eyes, we want to be entertained.So, we settle for no less than 24/7 media consumption. Just look at my typical morning routine.I watch my funny little videos on my phone while I brush my teeth. I check Instagram while I get ready for the day. I watch Netflix while responding to texts. I read the news too. I read articles about how the world is burning nestled between online ads about Chick-fil-A’s new pimento cheese sandwich. Then I carry on with my day. Because how am I supposed to form any serious critical thoughts about the world when an H&M pop-up ad just informed me that they’re having a 2-for-1 sale this Friday? On the bus, I put on my headphones and blast music so I can ignore those pesky feelings of overstimulation — don’t worry, I see the irony. Then I eat, sleep and repeat.In that entire routine, I don’t give myself the time to think. To understand how I feel. To understand how I’m going to approach the day. I’m so focused on connecting with the world that the value of understanding myself vanishes in the noise. And it’s so comfortable. Never having to confront any uncomfortable emotions is easy. Being able to log into Netflix any time a negative thought even has the semblance of forming is an emotional crutch. It’s a ruse to keep us functioning at an insane pace. It reminds me of Outkast’s “Hey Ya” lyric that says “Y’all don’t wanna hear me, you just wanna dance.” André 3000 was right. Why be sad when you can watch YouTube? Why hold yourself accountable when you can listen to music? We live in an age of distraction and it’s creating a generation that is losing sight of themselves.Now, let’s pause the pity party. How do we do better? How do we begin to value the stillness — the quietness — of daily life again?It’s going to look different for everyone, but for me, it means going outside more without my headphones. It means hearing birds sing and seeing kids play in the quad. It means giving myself more time to just exist with the people I love away from my phone. It means deliberately checking in with myself weekly. It means petting more dogs. It means not letting my hobbies die. It means more mid-afternoon naps.It means stopping our dependence on distractions to make our lives feel full. Life is going to be boring sometimes. It’s going to be slow and frustrating and painful. And sometimes life is not going to have music blasting in the background. But some things are meant to be savored without distraction.Susan Chemmanoor is a Trinity first-year.

Let’s put a red light on Duke’s purchase of Blue Light,Aaron Siegle,2023-10-13T04:00:00Z,Oct,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101323-siegle-red-light-on-dukes-blue-light-purchase-20231013.html,"Like an amoeba engulfing a helpless paramecium, Duke has yet again set its gaze on another piece of Durham real estate: Blue Light Apartments.As Duke struggles with its chronic housing shortage, Blue Light’s proximity to campus, high percentage of student tenants and modern renovations make it a logical choice for campus expansion. The expected return of the hundreds of third-years who are currently studying abroad only adds heightened urgency to the issue.But that doesn't mean the university should merely buy the property and take the easy way out.Duke’s previous forays into the Durham real estate market have shown that quick fixes to short-term housing capacity issues quickly turn into permanent features of Duke’s campus. The university’s purchases of Swift Apartments and Lancaster Commons unearthed the unintended consequences of acquiring off-campus housing. Instead of continually applying the duct tape of real estate acquisitions to the gushing pipe of the student housing shortage, Duke needs to address the root cause of the problem: the university’s residential model.Ever since the university closed the Central Campus Apartments in 2019, students have faced a chronic on-campus housing shortage. Come every August, it seems as if there is always a hectic scramble to find enough beds for both Duke and DKU undergrads. Meant as temporary stopgap housing to shelter students displaced by construction in Crowell and Craven Quads, the university bought Swift Apartments in 2016. Initially, the addition of Swift seemed like a win-win scenario. Duke bought the complex for a reasonable $50 million, and students got to live in luxury apartments that were now ""on-campus."" However, it wasn’t long before Swift began to reveal its dark side.Students began to realize that transitioning a private apartment complex into college dorms isn’t as painless as it may seem. Despite only being constructed in 2014, Swift residents noticed a litany of maintenance issues. Perhaps the most prominent were the saggy floors and unsafe balconies, which led Duke to cap the maximum number of people in an apartment at ten in 2021. While Duke administrators promised that the days of Swift were numbered, it is apparent that the facility is now an integral part of on-campus housing.In a similar fashion, Duke has been using the Lancaster Commons apartments to house graduate students, who had virtually no on campus housing options after the demolition of Central Campus. In many ways, the story of Lancaster mirrors Swift’s trajectory. The university first began using the complex as a temporary quarantine location for Covid positive students during the pandemic. But the utility of having a private developer shoulder the construction costs for student housing makes the location a convenient solution to the lack of grad student housing. This ignores the fact that Lancaster is on the side of a highway far away from campus and other amenities, which makes car ownership a de facto requirement for residents.Duke’s lust for Blue Light reinforces an eerie feeling of déjà vu when analyzing the university’s property acquisitions. Like Lancaster, students were temporarily housed in Blue Light to accommodate for social distancing during the pandemic. Like both Swift and Lancaster, Blue Light is a relatively new construction, popular with students living off campus, right next to a major freeway and in an area unfriendly to pedestrians. In other words, Blue Light today is in the same stage of the acquisition cycle as Swift was in 2015While purchasing Blue Light may be a straightforward fix to Duke’s housing shortage, looking at the acquisition through this narrow lens fails to consider the wider impacts of this action. The Triangle is one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United States, rapidly outpacing new housing. This has precipitated an affordable housing crisis in Durham, as an influx of students, tech workers and medical professionals outprice longtime low-income residents from the market. If the university purchases Blue Light, current residents will be forced to look elsewhere for housing, adding more demand to a supply-constrained market.Furthermore, acquiring Blue Light would reinforce an already worrying path dependency of the university purchasing off-campus to alleviate the housing shortfall. If Swift and Lancaster couldn’t solve the problem, is there anything special about Blue Light that would? Next time Duke is in a housing pickle, the university can always just buy another apartment complex near campus. There’s nothing stopping University Hill, Station Nine, Erwin Mill and The Lofts at Lakeview Apartments from being a part of campus soon.While the developers of these complexes would cash in, apartment residents would be forced to search for a new place to live. After the purchase of Swift, residents were only given a short notice from Durham Realty Incorporated, the company through which Duke acquires real estate, before they would have to move out.As Duke found out the hard way with Swift, luxury apartments not designed to cope with raucous parties can’t just be magically converted into college dorms. Blue Light has many upscale amenities, such as a rooftop pool and restaurant. Is Duke prepared to maintain these deluxe perks and if so, at what cost to residents?To tackle the problem of the on-campus housing shortage, Duke needs to address its root cause: the undergraduate residential program. All Duke undergrads are required to live on campus for their first three years. In theory, this sounds like a great way to build community and foster diverse social connections. However, in practice, students will be strewn across random apartment complexes in Durham to accommodate rising enrollment — a poor recipe for building community.Additionally, absorbing new housing complexes will undermine the already convoluted QuadEx residential system. Like Hollows and Swift, Blue Light will be another addition to the misfits quad, undergraduate housing that has no East-West quad connection. If a sizable portion of the undergraduate population does not live in the quad covered by QuadEx, then the sense of community and belonging will be undercut. The university needs to either fully commit to QuadEx by ensuring that most students live in residence halls covered by the system or acknowledge QuadEx’s shortcomings and move on.The future of residential life at Duke hinges on the Blue Light decision. Duke can either stick to the playbook by expanding into Blue Light for financial gain or choose to further invest in the property it owns. Redeveloping Central Campus, expanding current quads and eliminating the undergraduate housing requirements are critical steps that will sustainably manage Duke’s housing. Students will benefit by living in a walkable community and forming unique relationships. Durham residents will benefit from lower housing costs and an alleviation of the fear of being kicked out of their apartment. Avoiding the temptation of Blue Light, while difficult in the short run, is the first step toward building a thriving campus community in future decades.Aaron Siegle is a Trinity sophomore.

Call your mom back,Umang Dhingra,2023-10-13T04:00:00Z,Oct,13,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/dhingra-101323-call-your-mom-back-20231013.html,"Before Duke, I had never lived alone. The longest I had been away from my family was a few weeks at a journalism camp, as a high school freshman, and I called my mom thrice every day. And then, after what felt like two straight years of repeated lockdowns, I was boarding a flight to a different continent. From seeing them every waking minute to committing to seeing my family for less than two months a year, I decided that my ambition and the Duke name on my resume was worth missing everyone and everything.I’m comfortable with the decision I made. Duke has given me everything I could have dreamed of and more. I have received more love than I ever deemed myself worthy of, I have learned more than I could have possibly imagined and I have pushed myself more than I can sometimes believe. I have nothing but gratitude. Except maybe, the smallest bit of regret.Every time I go back home, I see a city and its people that are changing unbelievably fast, becoming almost unrecognizable. There are more skyscrapers than I remember. They’ve reconstructed the pavements I scraped my knees on. The traces of my childhood scattered in late-night storybooks are now replaced with my sister’s annotations on the pages. My younger brother has reached unprecedented new heights, metaphorically and literally. My grandfather’s voice is feebler. My mom and dad have grown a few more white hairs over the years. Every time I go back home, it feels like the city and the people I thought I had outgrown, have begun to outgrow me.I used to envy my American friends (especially those whose families live on the East Coast) when they would have the option to go home for birthdays and for long weekends and sometimes just because. In contrast, I had a rather expensive 18-hour intercontinental flight to catch, and I could only do that twice a year. But in some ways, I think I am better off because when I catch my long, uncomfortable flight, I make a mental shift. In some ways, I pause my life back in Delhi and press play on my life in Durham. I can’t imagine the conflict of living at Duke knowing another, completely separate life exists a 5-hour drive away.While little research exists across college years about homesickness, for first-year students at the very least, numbers range anywhere from 60% of people feeling homesick to as high as 94%. But I think eventually it stops being just about homesickness, and in some ways, evolves into being just the good old fear of missing out. The pain of missing out on the lives of the people you love moving on without you. People you have seen in relation to you so far (as your parents, your siblings), are now beginning to chart their own paths without you in the picture.This is not an article to convince you that the opportunity cost is not worth it. There is a reason that after finishing this article, I won’t be looking up flights back home but instead setting an alarm for my 8:30 tomorrow morning — I can’t even convince myself.All I am trying to convince you of, is that maybe it does not have to be this way. I can never live a dual life back in Delhi and here in Durham at the same time. But all I can do is check in, to make the effort to call my cousins at college and edit my sister's poems and occasionally gossip with my grandma. Is it enough? Probably not. But that is all I have for now.I recognize that to grow up in a loving, caring family is something unfortunately not everyone gets. Words cannot express how grateful I am that I did. If you didn’t, as we grow up, I hope you find that love and care in your chosen families and the families you build. You are so immensely worthy of it.The nurturing and affection of my family has made me everything that I am. Watching my dad cry for the first time in my life as he waved goodbye at the airport and how my mom went from being my parent to my friend, I recognize these as such unapologetic forms of love. I’ve spent my entire life demanding, receiving this love from them. It has been one of the great discoveries and joys of my adult life to stop seeing my mom and my dad as just my parents, but also as their own people with their own hopes and ambitions and flaws.If you’re fortunate enough to have a parent who calls you to check on you, call them back. Tell them about how you may have flunked your midterm. Ask them about that presentation at work they were stressed about. Let them yell at you because you have not done laundry in weeks. Ultimately, we are all missing out on each other's lives; for better or for worse, outgrowing each other. Call them back. See if you can hold on, just for a little bit longer.Umang Dhingra is a Trinity sophomore. Her column typically runs on alternate Fridays. "
Tribute to Angela Risi: 'She was an intensely beautiful and generous artist',Leo Ryan,2023-10-12T20:35:00Z,Oct,12,Letters To The Editor,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/101223-ryan-angela-risi-tribute-20231012.html,"I first met Angela at the Duke MFA in Dance orientation at the Rubenstein Arts Center during the fall of 2022. Angela arrived in a fantastic outfit, looking effortlessly cool (as I would come to know was one of her specialties), and I was struck by her apparent uniquenessand immensely interesting additions to our group conversations. I realized almost instantly how infectiously energetic she was, and that we would all benefit from her evident brilliance in the dance department. As time passed, I got to know Angela through courses at Duke and also through our time together outside of school. Angela and I are both part of the queer community, and I think we felt a camaraderie, maybe even a shared responsibility toward each other, when we met. I remember her texting me immediately after she arrived in Durham and asking where she could find some more of us, so I told her about some local spaces I knew of. Angela seemed to be on a mission of community-building because, wow, did she make a lot of friends — andfast. It was mesmerizing. The first time we hung out — just the two of us — Angela had invited me to her home. When I got there, I asked if she wanted to talk about the program or if she wanted to talk about other things. We agreed to talk about other things, and Angela quickly decided to give mea tour of her house. She spent the most time pointing out precious possessions, and in particular, her collection of artwork and ephemera gifted to her by loved ones. It was clear to me then how fiercely she loved those around her. The first time I ever saw Angela dance at length was in our Movement Research course for an assignment that required each of us to dance for an entire hour, taking turns each week. When Angela’s turn came around, she seemed calm even in the face of this daunting task. Asshe moved, she was feeling, touch and texture embodied. She was strong and soft at the same time — a balance that is difficult to strike, yet she did it with ease. I can still remember exactly how she looked that day and her repetitions of specific movements, which demanded my full attention. Her movement made me want to really know her.Angela’s passing is overwhelmingly painful. No one will be able to fill space in the particular and beautiful way that she did. Angela begged us all to see the value in community. Specifically, she reminded me personally of the value in queer community and nudged me out of bouts of self-isolation. For that, I am eternally grateful. She was an intensely beautiful and generous artist, and since her passing, I can’t stop thinking about her voice and how it sounded.Leo Ryan is an MFA in Dance alumnx ('23)."
Exams are at risk of extinction,Anna Garziera,2023-10-12T04:00:00Z,Oct,12,Campus Voices,https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/data/dukechronicle-opinion/www.dukechronicle.com/article/garziera-101223-exams-extinction-risk-20231012.html,"Skepticism towards standardized tests has become increasingly obvious in recent years, with more than 1,900 colleges and universities in the U.S. remaining test-optional for the 2023-24 application cycle. Just a few months ago, Harvard University announced that applications will remain test-optional for at least four more admissions cycles, asserting that “students who do not submit standardized test scores will not be disadvantaged in their application process.”After hearing this, my gut tells me that one of two things might be happening. Either the admissions team's assertion can be taken with a grain of salt, or Harvard University is not the school it used to be.At any rate, this recent shift has not come out of the blue, but rather sprung from a larger looming societal trend: The rejection of tests as an accurate reflection of students’ intelligence and learning capability — more and more are arguing that we should do without school examinations altogether.First, parents are more concerned about the stress levels of their children — and rightly so. APA’s Stress in America 2020 Survey revealed that Gen Z is the most stressed generation yet. Although some would argue that other factors — namely the pandemic, mental health concerns, the over-consumption of media — are the cause of this stress, waves of parents are now pointing their fingers at school administrators. Having been in use since the mid-1800s, one would think that something as common as school testing is considered tried and true by all. This is not the case.I remember clearly the first time I ever felt stressed. It was on the first of a five-day-long trip with my kindergarten class to Malcesine, a small town on Lake Garda, Italy. I was five years old, and it was too early that morning when my mom ushered me towards my classmates, who were waiting for me on the bus. I saw her from the window, getting smaller and smaller as she waved goodbye from the parking lot. After just a few minutes, I started to panic — I didn’t think I could make it without her. In her usual fashion, my teacher, Ms. Graziella, calmed me down in the way she knew best, by distracting me and making me dance. That first night without our parents was rough for all of us, and tears were shed all around. However, no parents were called; no amount of coddling was indulged in.This, whether we liked it or not, made us tougher.Nowadays, nothing is allowed to be stressful — even here at Duke, this became obvious from the beginning.I chose PWILD for my experiential orientation project, a five-night camping trip that promised a week of hiking and living — as the name suggests — in the wild. As a fairly experienced camper, I was prepared for the worst. Because of this, when the cushiony concept of “challenge by choice” was introduced to me, I was taken aback. Wasn’t my consent to be challenged already implied when I chose to partake in PWILD?Wouldn’t it be easy, if life was really like that? An opt-in culture would mean that students might “opt in” going to lectures or “opt in” to completing assignments. Clearly, reality isn’t like that at all.However, I can’t even blame the school or the organization for protecting itself from any unsolicited lawsuits. By making it clear that they aren’t forcing students into anything, they can’t be blamed for any stress a student might be feeling. In addition, they emphasize that peer pressure does not factor into the stress-causing equation. How? By changing the wording. As students “opt in” rather than “opt out,” the default becomes to not participate.I don’t know about you, but to me, this is all starting to feel like receiving a participation medal in fifth grade athletics events.Just as fifth graders are taught that true athletic ability does not really matter, as all efforts are rewarded just the same, both high school and college students’ assignments are increasingly graded on completion.Rather than being encouraging, this tactic results in declining motivation. I’m as guilty of this as anyone else. Let’s relate this idea to my Calculus II class, for a change. Whereas I complete the optional daily homeworks to the best of my ability for my own sake, I put nearly no effort into the Weekly Check-Ins, which are graded on completion.Educators are becoming softer, but rather than benefiting their students, they might be unintentionally harming them.Likewise, most testing now has the option of extra time and special testing environments for some students. While accommodations should be made to account for differing abilities, they should not be made to account for students’ declining motivation to study. That is, professors should not make a test easier simply because the previous class did poorly on it—they should encourage the current class to study harder. With testing being administered more fairly, the longing to abolish school examinations seems counterproductive.However, stress can be good for us sometimes. For most of us, some of the most stressful exams we ever took were also our firsts — like most things, taking tests does get easier with practice.Nevertheless, a majority of students agree with this trend. If given the option, I would bet most students here at Duke would opt for an exam-free semester any day. That is, whether or not they have considered if the change would benefit or harm them in the long run.The abolition of exams would mean an increased focus on learning only from class to class. In essence, students would only have to relate what material was talked about that day to complete the next assignment, never looking back beyond one lecture or two. While this seems all very cozy, the habit of committing any material to long-term memory would eventually fade. Furthermore, any assurance that a student really knows the material would be removed, as when graded material is take-home, there is no guarantee that external resources won’t be used to complete it. Imagine being operated by a surgeon who has never had to take a test. Would you trust that he really knew all that he should?With the declining importance of examinations, more pressure is placed on students to build up the rest of their resumes. Once, graduating with a decent GPA from a decent school alone could you pretty far in life. No longer. Now, community involvement and leadership roles are more relevant. And don’t we know it! Here at Duke, resume culture is more prevalent than ever.As undergraduate applications are becoming more and more subjective, success can no longer be achieved by academic effort alone. Stellar writing, then, is more important than ever — two students might be part of the same school organization, play the same sport, and even be part of the same community service. However, one student’s personal essay might read more smoothly than the other. Then, the difference between being admitted and rejected shifts from being a standardized test score to proficiency in writing. Is that really better?With all this in mind, we now trail off into the rest of this fall semester with one set of midterms down, and one to go, more grateful for these exams than ever before.Exams are stressful.
