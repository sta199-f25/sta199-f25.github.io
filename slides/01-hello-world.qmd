## Meet data science

::: incremental
-   **Data science** is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge.

-   We're going to learn to do this in a modern and `tidy` way -- more on that later!

-   This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on **statistical thinking**.
:::

## Let's do some data science! {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
-   Yesterday we collected some data from you!

-   Today we're going to explore that data together, following the data science cycle.
:::
::: {.column}
![](images/01/data-science-cycle.png){fig-alt="Data science cycle: Import, tidy, transform, visualize, model, communicate." fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

. . .

::: callout-warning
The data is anonymized and randomized and contains only a subset of the data collected. The rows have been shuffled for each column independently, meaning that no row belongs to a single student in the course. Additionally, any identifying information has been removed. Please do not try to de-anonymize or re-identify any individuals in the dataset.
:::


## Beginning the data science cycle {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
You took a survey:

![](images/01/canvas-survey.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of Getting to know you survey on Canvas." fig-align="center" fig-width="200"}
:::
::: {.column width="25%" .fragment}
Canvas stored your data in a CSV (comma-separated values) file:

{{< fa file-csv size=8x title="CSV file icon" >}}
:::
::: {.column width="25%" .fragment}
We want to explore the data that is in that file!
:::
::: 

## Import

![](images/01/data-science-cycle-import.png){fig-alt="Data science cycle: Import, tidy, transform, visualize, model, communicate. Import is highlighted." fig-align="center"}

## Load some packages

More on what packages are on Thursday, but in a nutshell "get your tools out of the toolbox":

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse) # for data wrangling and visualization
library(scales)    # for better axis labels
library(tidytext)  # for handling text data
library(taylor)    # for a surprise!
```

## Import the data

Import the data called `survey-anonymized.csv` in the folder called `data` using the `read_csv()` function:

```{r}
#| eval: false
survey <- read_csv("data/survey-anonymized.csv")
```

```{r}
#| include: false
survey <- read_csv(here::here("slides", "data/survey-anonymized.csv"))
```

## Take a peek at the data {.smaller}

```{r}

```{r}
#| echo: false

```
:::
::: {.column width="30%"}
{{< include _wooclap-column.qmd >}}

## Statistics experience

We asked you the following multiple-choice question where you could only pick one option:

::: demo
Have you taken any statistics courses before?

- Yes, I have taken another college course on statistics
- Yes, I have taken a high school statistics course
- No, I have not taken any statistics courses
:::

## Visualize

One way to make sense of data collected via a question like this is to visualize it.

![](images/01/data-science-cycle-visualize.png){fig-alt="Data science cycle: Import, tidy, transform, visualize, model, communicate. Visualize is highlighted." fig-align="center"}

## Visualize

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-asp: 0.4
survey |>
  count(stats_experience) |>
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) |>
  ggplot(aes(y = stats_experience, x = prop))+
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_y_discrete(labels = label_wrap(20)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1), breaks = c(0, 0.25, 0.5)) +
  labs(
    title = "Prior statistics experience among STA 199 students",
    y = NULL,
    x = "Count"
  ) +
  labs(
    caption = "Data are self-reported, collected from STA 199 students on August 25, 2025."
  )
```


## Programming experience {.smaller}

We also asked you the following multiple-choice question where you could only pick one option:

::: demo
How much experience do you have with programming?

- None
- A little — I've written a few lines or done small exercises
- Some — I've worked on a few projects or used it occasionally
- A lot — I use programming regularly and feel confident writing code
:::

## Visualize

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-asp: 0.5
survey |>
  count(programming_experience) |>
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) |>
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(programming_experience, prop), x = prop, fill = prop))+
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_y_discrete(labels = label_wrap(25)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1), breaks = c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "E") +
  labs(
    title = "Prior programming experience among STA 199 students",
    y = NULL,
    x = "Count"
  ) +
  labs(
    caption = "Data are self-reported, collected from STA 199 students on August 25, 2025."
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

## Learn best {.xsmall}

We also asked you the following multiple-choice question where you could as many options as you liked:

::: demo
What types of data interest you?

- Crime
- Economics
- Education
- Entertainment (e.g., books, movies, music)
- Environment/Climate
- Health (e.g., social determinants of health, medical)
- Politics
- Sports
- Other
- No preference
:::

## Peek at the data {.smaller}

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
survey |>
  select(data_interests)
```

## Tidy  + Transform

Before we can visualize this variable, we need to tidy and transform it.

![](images/01/data-science-cycle-tidy-transform.png){fig-alt="Data science cycle: Import, tidy, transform, visualize, model, communicate. Tidy and transform are highlighted." fig-align="center"}

## Tidy + Transform {.smaller}

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
survey |>
  # remove text in parentheses
  mutate(data_interests = str_remove_all(data_interests, "\\s*\\(.*?\\)")) |>
  # separate into multiple rows for each interest, using comma as delimiter
  separate_longer_delim(data_interests, delim = ",") |>
  count(data_interests, sort = TRUE) |>
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
```

## Visualize

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
survey |>
  mutate(data_interests = str_remove_all(data_interests, "\\s*\\(.*?\\)")) |>
  separate_longer_delim(data_interests, delim = ",") |>
  count(data_interests, sort = TRUE) |>
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) |>
  filter(!is.na(data_interests)) |>
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(data_interests, prop), x = prop, fill = prop)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_y_discrete(labels = label_wrap(20)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_fill_taylor_c(album = "Speak Now") +
  labs(
    title = "Data interests among STA 199 students",
    y = NULL,
    x = "Count",
    caption = "Data are self-reported, collected from STA 199 students on August 25, 2025."
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

## Learn best

We also asked you the following open-ended question:

::: demo
How do you learn best?
:::

## Tidy + Transform + Summarize {.smaller}

We can use text mining techniques, like *tokenizing* to words to explore this open-ended question:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
survey |>
  select(learn_best) |>
  unnest_tokens(word, learn_best) |>
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") |>
  count(word, sort = TRUE) |>
  filter(n > 15) |>
  print(n = Inf)
```

## Tidy + Transform + Summarize {.smaller}

We can also tokenize to *bigrams* (pairs of words):

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
survey |>
  select(learn_best) |>
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(bigrams, learn_best, token = "ngrams", n = 2) |>
  count(bigrams, sort = TRUE) |>
  filter(n > 10) |>
  print(n = Inf)
```

## Programming language comfort {.smaller}

We also asked you the following open-ended question:

::: demo
If you’ve programmed before, which languages have you used, and how comfortable do you feel with each? If you haven’t programmed before, please leave this question blank.
:::

## Take a peek + Participate 💻📱 {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
And the answers are non-trivial to tidy up, e.g.,

```
- Python - I've used it very little.
- I have not programmed before. 
- Java - very comfortable. Python - pretty comfortable. C/C++ - not super comfortable, haven't used since high school.
```

## Can AI help? {.smaller}

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
library(ellmer)

chat <- chat_openai()

prompts <- survey |>
  filter(!is.na(programming_languages)) |>
  pull(programming_languages) |>
  list()

type_language <- type_object(
  language = type_string(),
  experience = type_string()
)

language_experience <- parallel_chat_structured(chat, prompts, type = type_language)
language_experience
```

```
language
1 Python, Java, R, C/C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, C#, VBA, MATLAB, Rust, Assembly, Swift, Stata, Bash, Typescript, Web3 Suite (HTML, CSS, JS), Nextflow, SAS, PsycoPy, Mathematica, React, Vue, Yaml, CourseKata, Flutter, Scratch

experience
1 Most students report a range of programming experience, from never having programmed before to being very comfortable in languages such as Python, Java, and R. Many took introductory courses (e.g., CS101, AP CS A) and are comfortable with basic programming constructs. Proficiency is generally highest in Python and Java, though some only have a little experience with languages like R, C/C++, and JavaScript. Quite a few have only used programming languages for specific classes or research projects and may not feel confident after a long break. Some students have experience with more niche or specialized tools such as MATLAB, SAS, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JS frameworks). Many express a need for a refresher if not used recently. In summary, while a core group is comfortable with at least one language, especially Python or Java, many others have only basic to moderate experience and express the desire to gain more proficiency.
