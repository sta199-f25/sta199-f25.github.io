## Recap: Pivot {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   ***When should you pivot?*** If all of the data you need is in your data frame, but the columns you need don't exist, there is a good chance it's time to pivot!
-   ***Wide and long:*** Data sets can't be labeled as *wide* or *long* but they can be made *wider* or *longer* for a certain analysis that requires a certain format
-   ***Pivot longer - data type:*** When pivoting longer, variable names that turn into values are characters by default. If you need them to be in another format, you need to explicitly make that transformation, which you can do so within the `
pivot_longer()
` function.

## Recap: Plotting {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   You can tweak a plot forever, but at some point the tweaks are likely not very productive.

-   However, you should always be critical of defaultsand see if you can improve the plot to better portray your data / results / what you want to communicate.

-   Group by `swing_state`
-   Summarize to find the mean sales tax in each type of state

## Participate ðŸ“±ðŸ’» {.xsmall}

First, create a vector called `list_of_swing_states` that contains the names of the swing states.

```{r}
# fmt: skip
list_of_swing_states <- c(
  "Arizona", "Georgia", "Michigan", "Nevada", "North Carolina",
  "Pennsylvania", "Wisconsin"
)
```

Then, fill in the blanks to create a new variable called `swing_state` with levels `"Swing"` and `"Non-swing"`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
sales_taxes <- sales_taxes |>
  __BLANK_1__(
    swing_state = __BLANK_2__(
      state __BLANK_3__ list_of_swing_states, "Swing", "Non-swing"

## Sales tax in coastal states {.smaller}

::: question
Suppose you're tasked with the following:

> Compare the average state sales tax rates of states on the Pacific Coast, states on the Atlantic Coast, and the rest of the states.

How would you approach this task?
:::

. . .

-   Create a new variable called `coast` with levels `"Pacific"`, `"Atlantic"`, and `"Neither"`
-   Group by `coast`
-   Summarize to find the mean sales tax in each type of state

## Participate ðŸ“±ðŸ’» {.xsmall}

::: columns
::: {.column width="85%"}

::: wooclap
First, create two vectors called `pacific_coast` and `atlantic_coast` that contain the respective states.

```{r}
pacific_coast <- c("Alaska", "Washington", "Oregon", "California", "Hawaii")

# fmt: skip
atlantic_coast <- c(
  "Connecticut", "Delaware", "Georgia", "Florida", "Maine", "Maryland", "Massachusetts",
  "New Hampshire", "New Jersey", "New York", "North Carolina", "Rhode Island", 
  "South Carolina", "Virginia"
)
```

Then, fill in the blank to create a new variable called `coast`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
sales_taxes <- sales_taxes |>
  mutate(
    coast = __BLANK__(
      state %in% atlantic_coast ~ "Atlantic",
      state %in% pacific_coast  ~ "Pacific",
      .default = "Neither"
    )
  )
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
sales_taxes <- sales_taxes |>
  mutate(
    coast = case_when(
      state %in% atlantic_coast ~ "Atlantic",
      state %in% pacific_coast  ~ "Pacific",
      .default = "Neither"
    )
  )
```

## Recap: `case_when()`

``` r
case_when(
  x > y  ~ "x is greater than y", #<1>
  x < y  ~ "x is less than y",    #<2>
  .default = "x is equal to y"    #<3>  
)
```

1.  Value if first condition is `TRUE`
2.  Value if second condition is `TRUE`
3.  Value if neither condition is `TRUE`, i.e., default value

```

## Sales tax in US regions {.smaller}

::: question
Suppose you're tasked with the following:

> Compare the average state sales tax rates of states in various regions (Midwest - 12 states, Northeast - 9 states, South - 16 states, West - 13 states).

How would you approach this task?
:::

. . .

-   Create a new variable called `region` with levels `"Midwest"`, `"Northeast"`, `"South"`, and `"West"`.
-   Group by `region`
-   Summarize to find the mean sales tax in each type of state

## `mutate()` with `case_when()` {.smaller .scrollable}

::: question
Who feels like filling in the blanks lists of states in each region?
Who feels like it's simply too tedious to write out names of all states?
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false
list_of_midwest_states <- c(___)
list_of_northeast_states <- c(___)
list_of_south_states <- c(___)
list_of_west_states <- c(___)

sales_taxes <- sales_taxes |>
  mutate(
    coast = case_when(
      state %in% list_of_west_states ~ "Midwest",
      state %in% list_of_northeast_states ~ "Northeast",
      state %in% list_of_south_states ~ "South",
      state %in% list_of_west_states ~ "West"

# Joining data

## Why join? {.smaller}

Suppose we want to answer questions like:

> Is there a relationship between\
> - number of QS courses taken\
> - having scored a 4 or 5 on the AP stats exam\
> - motivation for taking course\
> - ...\
> and performance in this course?

. . .

Each of these would require *join*ing class performance data with an outside data source so we can have all relevant information (columns) in a single data frame.

## Why join? {.smaller}

Suppose we want to answer questions like:

> Compare the average state sales tax rates of states in various regions (Midwest - 12 states, Northeast - 9 states, South - 16 states, West - 13 states).

. . .

This can also be solved with *join*ing region information with the state-level sales tax data.
