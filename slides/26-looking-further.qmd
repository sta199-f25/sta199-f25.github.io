## Sex discrimination in hiring {.smaller}

- A study investigating sex discrimination in the 1970s was set in the context of personnel decisions within a bank. The research question we hope to answer is, “Are individuals who identify as female discriminated against in promotion decisions made by their managers who identify as male?” 

- This study considered sex roles, and only allowed for options of “male” and “female”. The identities being considered are not gender identities and the study allowed only for a binary classification of sex.

## Study design {.smaller}

- Participants: 48 bank supervisors who identified as male, attending a management institute at the University of North Carolina in 1972

- Task: Assume the role of the personnel director of a bank and judge whether a candidate should be promoted to a branch manager position based on personnel files they were randomly assigned

- Personnel files: Identical except that half of them indicated the candidate identified as male and the other half indicated the candidate identified as female

- Variables: `sex` (male or female), `decision` (promoted or not promoted)

## Hypotheses {.smaller}

p = Proportion of candidates promoted

. . .

**Null hypothesis:** Sex and promotion decision are independent, i.e., males and females are equally likely to be promoted.

$$ p_{Male} = p_{Female} $$

. . .

**Alternative hypothesis:** Sex and promotion decision are dependent, i.e., males and females are not equally likely to be promoted.

$$ p_{Male} \ne p_{Female} $$
