## Data

-   Taxi trips in Chicago, IL in 2022

-   Data from [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew)

## Data: `chicago_taxi` {.smaller}

```{r}
#| include: false
chicago_taxi <- read_csv(here::here("slides", "data/chicago-taxi.csv"))
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
chicago_taxi <- read_csv("data/chicago-taxi.csv")
```

```{r}
chicago_taxi
```

## Data: `chicago_taxi` {.smaller}

```{r}
glimpse(chicago_taxi)
```

## Data prep

```{r}
chicago_taxi <- chicago_taxi |>
  mutate(
    tip = fct_relevel(tip, "no", "yes"),
    local = fct_relevel(local, "no", "yes"),
    dow = fct_relevel(dow, "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"),
    month = fct_relevel(month, "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr")
  )
```

## Outcome and predictors {.smaller}

- Outcome - `tip`: Whether rider left a tip -- a factor w/ levels "yes" and "no"
- (Potential) predictors:
  - Numerical:
    - `distance`: The trip distance, in odometer miles.
    - `hour`: The hour of the day in which the trip began.
  - Categorical:
    - `company`: The taxi company -- companies that occurred few times were binned as "other".
    - `local`: Whether the trip started in the same community area as it began.
    - `dow`: The day of the week in which the trip began.
    - `month`: The month in which the trip began.

## Should we include a predictor?

To determine whether we should include a predictor in a model, we should start by asking:

::: incremental
-   Is it ethical to use this variable?
    (Or even legal?)

-   Will this variable be available at prediction time?

-   Does this variable contribute to explainability?
:::

# Data splitting and spending

## We've been cheating!

::: incremental
-   So far, we've been using all the data we have for building models.
    In predictive contexts, this would be considered *cheating*.

-   Evaluating model performance for predicting outcomes that were used when building the models is like evaluating your learning with questions whose answers you've already seen.
:::

## Spending your data {.smaller}

For predictive models (used primarily in machine learning), we typically split data into training and test sets:

![](images/21/test-train-split-1.svg){fig-align="center"}

-   The **training set** is used to estimate model parameters.

-   The **test set** is used to find an independent assessment of model performance.

. . .

::: callout-warning
Do not use, or even peek at, the test set during training.
:::

## How much to spend?

::: incremental
-   The more data we spend (use in training), the better estimates we’ll get.

-   Spending too much data in training prevents us from computing a good assessment of predictive performance.

-   Spending too much data in testing prevents us from computing a good estimate of model parameters.
:::

## The initial split

```{r}
#| label: initial-split
set.seed(20251111)
chicago_taxi_split <- initial_split(chicago_taxi)
chicago_taxi_split
```

## Setting a seed {.smaller}

::: task
What does `set.seed()` do?
:::

::: incremental
-   To create that split of the data, R generates “pseudo-random” numbers: while they are made to behave like random numbers, their generation is deterministic given a “seed”.

-   This allows us to reproduce results by setting that seed.

-   Which seed you pick doesn’t matter, as long as you don’t try a bunch of seeds and pick the one that gives you the best performance.

## Accessing the data

```{r}
#| label: access-data
chicago_taxi_train <- training(chicago_taxi_split)
chicago_taxi_test <- testing(chicago_taxi_split)
```

## The training set {.smaller}

```{r}

# Exploratory data analysis

## Initial questions {.smaller}

-   What’s the distribution of the outcome, `tip`?

-   What’s the distribution of numeric variables like `distance` or `hour`?

-   How does the distribution of `tip` differ across the categorical and numerical variables?

. . .

::: task
Which dataset should we use for the exploration?
The entire data `chicago_taxi`, the training data `chicago_taxi_train`, or the testing data `chicago_taxi_test`?
:::

## `tip`

What’s the distribution of the outcome, `tip`?

```{r}
chicago_taxi_train |>
  count(tip) |>
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
```

## `distance`

What’s the distribution of `distance`?

```{r}
ggplot(chicago_taxi_train, aes(x = distance)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3)
```

## `tip` and `distance` {.smaller}

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|7"
ggplot(chicago_taxi_train, aes(x = distance, fill = tip, group = tip)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("yes" = "darkolivegreen4", "no" = "darkgray")) +
  facet_wrap(~tip, ncol = 1, labeller = label_both, scales = "free_y")
```

## `tip` and `hour` {.smaller}

```{r}
ggplot(chicago_taxi_train, aes(x = hour, fill = tip, group = tip)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("yes" = "darkolivegreen4", "no" = "darkgray")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 18, by = 6)) +
  facet_wrap(~tip, ncol = 1, labeller = label_both, scales = "free_y")
```

## `tip` and `local` {.smaller}

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2"
ggplot(chicago_taxi_train, aes(x = local, fill = tip)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill", color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("yes" = "darkolivegreen4", "no" = "darkgray")) +
  labs(y = "Proportion") +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

## `tip` and `dow` {.smaller}

```{r}
ggplot(chicago_taxi_train, aes(x = dow, fill = tip)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill", color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("yes" = "darkolivegreen4", "no" = "darkgray")) +
  labs(y = "Proportion", x = "Day of week") +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

# Terminology

## False negative and positive

-   **False negative rate** is the proportion of actual positives that were classified as negatives.

-   **False positive rate** is the proportion of actual negatives that were classified as positives.

## Sensitivity

**Sensitivity** is the proportion of actual positives that were correctly classified as positive.

-   Also known as **true positive rate** and **recall**

-   Sensitivity = 1 − False negative rate

-   Useful when false negatives are more "expensive" than false positives

## Specificity

**Specificity** is the proportion of actual negatives that were correctly classified as negative

-   Also known as **true negative rate**

-   Specificity = 1 − False positive rate

## ROC curve

The **receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve** allows to assess the model performance across a range of thresholds.

## ROC curve {.smaller}

::: task
Which corner of the plot indicates the best model performance?

# Next steps

## Next steps {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Fit models on training data

-   Make predictions on testing data

-   Evaluate predictions on testing data:

    -   Linear models: R-squared, adjusted R-squared, RMSE (root mean squared error), etc.
    -   Logistic models: False negative and positive rates, AUC (area under the curve), etc.

-   Make decisions based on model predictive performance, validity across various testing/training splits (aka "cross validation"), explainability

::: callout-note
We will only learn about a subset of these in this course, but you can go further into these ideas in STA 210 or STA 221 as well as in various machine learning courses.
