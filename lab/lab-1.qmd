# Introduction

This lab will introduce you to the course computing workflow.
The main goal is to reinforce our demo of R and RStudio, which we will be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.

::: callout-note
R is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface, commonly referred to as an integrated development environment or an IDE, for short.
:::

An additional goal is to reinforce Git and GitHub, the version control, web hosting, and collaboration systems that we will be using throughout the course.

::: callout-note
Git is a version control system (like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).
:::

As the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer.
Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R.
Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.

::: callout-warning
This lab assumes that you have already completed [Lab 0](lab-0.html).
If you have not, please

-   go back and do that first before proceeding and
-   let your TA know as they will need to set up a Lab 1 repository for you before you can complete this lab.
:::

## Learning objectives

By the end of the lab, you will...

-   Be familiar with the workflow using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub
-   Gain practice writing a reproducible report using Quarto
-   Practice version control using Git and GitHub
-   Be able to create data visualizations with the `tidyverse`, specifically using `ggplot2`
-   Be able to write a simple data transformation pipeline with the `tidyverse`, specifically using `dplyr`

## Getting started

### Step 1: Log in to RStudio

-   Go to <https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers> and login with your Duke NetID and Password.
-   Click `STA199` under My reservations to log into your container. You should now see the RStudio environment.

#### Refresher: R and R Studio

Below are the components of the RStudio IDE.

![](images/lab-1/rstudio.png){fig-alt="RStudio IDE"}

Below are the components of a Quarto (.qmd) file.

![](images/lab-1/quarto.png){fig-alt="Quarto document"}

### Step 2: Clone the repo & start new RStudio project

-   Go to the course organization at [github.com/sta199-f25](https://github.com/sta199-f25) organization on GitHub.
    Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-1**.
    It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.

-   Click on the green **CODE** button, select **Use SSH** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with SSH**).
    Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

-   In RStudio, go to *File* ➛ *New Project* ➛*Version Control* ➛ *Git*.

-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. Again, please make sure to have *SSH* highlighted under *Clone* when you copy the address.

-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.

-   Click *lab-1.qmd* to open the template Quarto file.
    This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.

### Step 3: Update the YAML

The top portion of your Quarto file (between the three dashed lines) is called **YAML**.
It stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language".
It is a human-friendly data representation for all programming languages.
All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.

-   Open the Quarto (`.qmd`) file in your project, change the `author` name to your name (first and last) and add the names (first and last) of your teammates to the `description` field and render the document.

-   If you get a popup window error, click "Try again".

-   Examine the rendered document and make sure your name is updated in the document.

### Step 4: Commit your changes

-   Go to the Git pane in RStudio.
    This will be in the top right hand corner in a separate tab.

    If you have made changes to your Quarto (.qmd) file, you should see it listed here.
    If you have rendered the document, you should also see its output, a PDF file, listed there.

-   Click on it to select it in this list and then click on **Diff**.

    This shows you the *diff*erence between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes.
    You should see deletions in red and additions in green.

-   If you're happy with these changes, prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository.

    -   First, **stage** your changes by checking the appropriate box on the files you want to prepare.

    -   Next, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, "Updated author name") in the **Commit message** box.

    -   Finally, click **Commit**.
        Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.

::: callout-note
You don't have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious.
You should commit states that are *meaningful to you* for inspection, comparison, or restoration (e.g., restoring a previous version of your document).

In the first few assignments, we will tell you exactly when to commit and, in some cases, what commit message to use.
As the semester progresses, we will let you make these decisions.
:::

### Step 5: Push your changes

Now that you have made an update and committed this change, it's time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.

-   In the Git pane, click on Push.

-   Then, make sure all the changes went to GitHub.
    Go to your GitHub repo in your browser and refresh the page.
    You should see your commit message next to the updated files.
    If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub, and you're good to go!

::: callout-warning
If you don't see your update, go back to Step 4.
Remember that in order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have **staged** (checked boxes) your **commit** (with a commit message) to be pushed and then click on **Push**.
:::

## Guidelines

Your plots should include an informative title, axes and legends should have human-readable labels, and careful consideration should be given to aesthetic choices.

Additionally, code should follow the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
Particularly,

-   there should be spaces before and line breaks after each `+` when building a `ggplot`,

-   there should also be spaces before and line breaks after each `|>` in a data transformation pipeline,

-   code should be properly indented,

-   there should be spaces around `=` signs and spaces after commas.

Furthermore, all code should be visible in the PDF output, i.e., should not run off the page on the PDF.
Long lines that run off the page should be split across multiple lines with line breaks.[^1]

[^1]: Remember, haikus not novellas when writing code!

Remember that continuing to develop a sound workflow for reproducible data analysis is important as you complete the lab and other assignments in this course.
There will be periodic reminders in this assignment to remind you to **render, commit, and push** your changes to GitHub.

::: callout-important
You should have at least 3 commits with meaningful commit messages by the end of the assignment.
:::

# Packages

In this lab we will work with the **tidyverse** package, which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
```

-   **Run** the code cell by clicking on the green triangle (play) button for the code cell labeled `load-packages`. This loads the package to make its features (the functions and datasets in it) be accessible from your *Console*.
-   Then, **render** the document which loads this package to make its features (the functions and datasets in it) be available for other code cells in your Quarto document.

## Refresher: tidyverse

The tidyverse is a meta-package.
When you load it you get nine packages loaded for you:

-   **dplyr**: for data wrangling
-   **forcats**: for dealing with factors
-   **ggplot2**: for data visualization
-   **lubridate**: for dealing with dates
-   **purrr**: for iteration with functional programming
-   **readr**: for reading and writing data
-   **stringr**: for string manipulation
-   **tibble**: for modern, tidy data frames
-   **tidyr**: for data tidying and rectangling

# Data

For this lab you will use a dataset on counties in North Carolina.

This dataset is stored in a file called `nc-county.csv` in the `data` folder of your project/repository.

You can read this file into R with the following code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
nc_county <- read_csv("data/nc-county.csv")
```

```{r}
#| include: false
nc_county <- read_csv(here::here("lab", "data/nc-county.csv"))
```

This will read the CSV (comma separated values) file from the `data` folder and store the dataset as a data frame called `nc_county` in R.

The variables in the dataset and their descriptions are as follows:

-   `county`: Name of county.
-   `state_abb`: State abbreviation (NC).
-   `state_name`: State name (North Carolina).
-   `land_area_m2`: Land area of county in meters-squared, based on the 2020 census.
-   `land_area_mi2`: Land area of county in miles-squared, based on the 2020 census.
-   `population`: Population of county, based on the 2020 census.
-   `density`: Population density calculated as population divided by land area in miles-squared (people per mile-squared).

# Question

::: callout-warning
## TO DO in lab meeting

Discuss how to prompt interaction/discussion with teammates.
:::

a. How many counties are in the dataset? How many variables are there?

Use inline code to answer this question.

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message "Added answer for part a".

Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.
:::

b. Make two plots: a histogram and a boxplot of the population variable. 

- Is the distribution of population in NC counties right-skewed, left-skewed, or approximately symmetric? Which plot(s) helped you determine this?

- Is the distribution of population in NC counties unimodal, bimodal, multimodal or uniform? Which plot(s) helped you determine this?

- In a single pipeline, identify the counties with unusually high populations (according to the boxplot) and display their names and populations in descending order of population.

```{r}
#| include: false
ggplot(nc_county, aes(x = population)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Population in NC Counties",
    x = "Population",
    y = NULL
  )

ggplot(nc_county, aes(x = population)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(
    title = "Population in NC Counties",
    x = "Population",
    y = NULL
  )

nc_county |>
  filter(population > 250000) |>
  select(county, population) |>
  arrange(desc(population))
```

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message "Added answer for part b".

Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.
:::

c. Guess what the relationship between population density and land area might be – positive?
negative?
no relationship?
Explain your reasoning.

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.

Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.
:::

d. Make a scatter plot of population density (`density` on the y-axis) vs. land area in miles-squared (`land_area_mi2` on the x-axis).
Make sure to set an informative title and axis labels for your plot.
Describe the relationship.
Was your guess correct?

```{r}
#| include: false
ggplot(nc_county, aes(x = land_area_mi2, y = density)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Population density vs. land area in NC Counties",
    x = "Land area (miles-squared)",
    y = "Population density (people per mile-squared)"
  )
```

::: render-commit-push
Now is another good time to render, commit, and push your all your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.
:::

::: callout-warning
## TO DO in lab meeting

Discuss if we should take out part (e) for time.
:::

e. Now make a scatter plot of population density (`density` on the y-axis) vs. land area in meters-squared (`land_area_m2` on the x-axis).
Make sure to set an informative title and axis labels for your plot.
Comment on how this scatterplot compares to the one in Exercise 8 — is the relationship displayed same or different.
Explain why.

```{r}
#| include: false
ggplot(nc_county, aes(x = land_area_m2, y = density)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Population density vs. land area in NC Counties",
    x = "Land area (meters-squared)",
    y = "Population density (people per meter-squared)"
  )
```

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your all your changes to GitHub with the commit message with a meaningful commit message.
:::

# Wrap-up
