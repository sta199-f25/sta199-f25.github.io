    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.5.1: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nInstall Quarto 1.7.32 or higher: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here.",

It’s usually the first thing you learn in programming – to learn to write a computer program to print this sentence to screen. Things will be different in this course, as it’s not a programming, but a data science course. So, starting tomorrow in class, you’ll learn to use a computing language (called R) to work with data.\nBut today, we need to set you up for success! Let’s first briefly review the components of the computational toolkit for the course:\n\nR: The programming language you’ll learn in this course.\nRStudio: The piece of software (a.k.a. the integrated development environment, IDE) you’ll use to write R code in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.\n\n\nQuarto: The tool you’ll use to create reproducible computational documents that contain both your narrative (i.e., words in English) and your code (i.e., code in R). Every piece of assignment you hand in will be a Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou might be familiar with word processors like MS Word or Google Docs. We will not be using these in this class. Instead, the words you would write in such a document as well as the code will go into a Quarto document, and when you render the document (more on what this means later) you will get a document out that has your words, your code, and the output of that code. Everything in one place, beautifully formatted!\n\n\nGit: Version control system.\nGitHub: A web hosting service for the Git version control system that also allows for transparent collaboration between team members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGit is a version control system (like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better)."

Read it. It should say: “No SSH key found. Generate one now?” You should click 1 for yes.\nThis will generate a key (basically a really long alpha-numeric password). R will then ask “Would you like to open a browser now?” You should click 1 for yes again.\nYou may be asked to provide your GitHub username and password to log into GitHub. After entering this information, you should paste the key in and give it a name. You might name it in a way that indicates where the key will be used, e.g., sta199).\n\nYou can find more detailed instructions here if you’re interested."

Your TAs and I will help you by providing you with materials answering questions, and setting a pace, but for this to work, you must do the following:\n\nWatch the videos and do the readings before each class.\n\nCome prepared so you can deeply engage with the material during lectures and labs instead of using class time to learn the basics.\n\nBe present and engaged in every lecture and lab.\n\nIn lectures do the application exercises, ask questions, and participate in discussions. In labs, work on the lab exercises, ask questions, and collaborate with your teammates. If you miss a class, make sure to catch up on the material before the next class.\n\nAsk questions.\n\nAs often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the lab, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\n\nDo the homework.\n\nThe earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example).\n\nDon’t procrastinate.\n\nThe content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

    "section": "Course components",
    "text": "Course components\n\nLectures\nLectures designed to be interactive, so you gain experience applying new concepts and learning from each other. My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and use them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, most lectures will feature application exercises that will serve as opportunities to practice what you’re learning as you’re learning it and be great preparation for the assignments and exams. You are expected to prepare for these by completing assigned readings and videos.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop (or Chromebook) to each class so that you can participate in the application activities. Please ensure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone. A tablet also works, but the user experience will be much smoother on a laptop.\n\n\nLabs\nLabs are designed to be hands-on at all times, therefore you’re similarly expected to bring a laptop to each lab session.\nDuring labs you will get a brief introduction to the week’s assignments from your TA and then work on the lab exercise with your teammates. You will often also have time to start working on your homework assignment during lab, once you complete the lab exercise.\n\n\nTeams\nYou will start off the semester in randomly assigned teams for each lab session for the first few weeks. Then, you will be assigned to a project team that you will work with for the remainder of the semester.\nAll team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of the project, and you will be asked to evaluate your team members throughout the semester. Failure to adequately contribute to any project component will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team’s overall mark. You are expected to use the provided GitHub repository as the central collaborative platform. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member’s relative contribution to each project.\n\n\nActivities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on seven components: lecture, lab, homework, project, two exams, a final, and attendance and participation.\n\nLectures\nAttendance and participation will be tracked through in-class questions via Wooclap, which you can access on your laptop or phone. You will earn points for answering questions during lecture, and these points will contribute to your attendance and participation grade.\nThere are 26 lectures during the semester. You must participate in Wooclap questions in at least 18 lectures to get full credit on this component. Otherwise your grade on this component will be calculated as the percentage of lectures you attended and participated, e.g., if you attend and participate in 22/26 lectures, you get the full 5% but if you attend and participate in 15/26 lectures, you get (15/26)5% = 2.88%.\nApplication exercises won’t be graded directly, but we will track activity on them to ensure you’re staying engaged with the course and exams will feature topics and questions from these exercises.\n\n\nLabs\nIn the first few weeks of the semester, you will be randomly assigned to a team and work with your teammates on an exercise that is due at the end of the lab session. Once project teams are formed, you will work with that team on the lab exercises. You must be present in lab to complete the lab assignment. There is no way to make up for missing a lab.\nYou will submit your lab assignments by pushing your work to your GitHub repository for the lab and submitting the PDF output on Gradescope by the end of your lab session.\nThere are eight graded labs in the semester. The lowest two lab grades will be dropped at the end of the semester, which means you can miss up to two lab sessions with no penalty.\n\n\nHomework\nYou will complete homework assignments individually. You may start working on your homeowork assignment during your lab session, once you complete your lab exercise, but you will need to finish it outside of class. Your homework will be comprised of some practice exercises where you can get immediate feedback from AI tools designed for this course and some graded exercises.\nYou will submit your homework assignments by pushing your work to your GitHub repository for the homework and submitting the PDF output on Gradescope by 11:59pm on Sundays.\nThere are six graded homework assignments in the semester. The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester, which means you can miss one homework assignment with no penalty.\n\n\nExams\nThis course will have three exams: two exams and a final. The exams will include an in-class component (with a cheat sheet) and an open-note take-home component, while the final will include only an in-class component (with a cheat sheet).\nYou can demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far through these exams. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The exam’s content will be related to the content in videos and reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, and labs.\nYou will submit your take-home exam by pushing your work to your GitHub repository for the exam and submitting the PDF output on Gradescope by the stated deadline on the schedule.\n\n\nProject\nThe project aims to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed in teams, and each team will present their work during a lab session in the latter part of the semester. The write-up will be due on the same day.\nYou cannot pass this course if you have not completed the project.\nMore information about the project will be provided during the semester.",

    "text": "Course policies\n\nDuke Community Standard\nAs a student in this course, you have agreed to uphold the Duke Community Standard and the practices specific to this course.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nCollaboration: Only work that is clearly assigned as teamwork should be completed collaboratively.\n\nCollaboration in teams for lab assignments is not only allowed but expected. You are encouraged to work together with your lab team to complete the lab exercise. However, each student must submit their own write-up of the lab exercise, which should reflect their understanding and ideas.\nSimilarly, collaboration within teams is not only allowed but expected for the project. The difference is that the project is a single, collaborative work developed by the entire team. It is the team’s responsibility to make sure all components of the project are vetted and revised by all team members, even if some division of labor takes place for first drafts of components. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed; however, you may not share code or project components across teams.\nYou may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write-up with other students. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write-up will be considered a violation for all students involved, regardless of whether the work was shared or copied – all students involved will receive a 0 for assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards for further action.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams (in class and take home). Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write-up will be considered a violation for all students involved, regardless of whether the work was shared or copied – all students involved will receive a 0 for assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards for further action.\nOn individual assignments, you may not directly share work (including code) with another student in this class; on team assignments, you may not directly share work (including code) with another team. “Sharing” includes, but is not limited to, messaging, emailing, or otherwise providing your work to another student or team.\n\nOnline resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow), but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, like other online resources. Two guiding principles govern how to use AI in this course:\n\nCognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your thinking ability. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and ensure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n AI tools for code: You may use generative AI tools when you need help with assignments. However you should first attempt to solve the problem yourself. Your submission should not be a copy-paste of AI-generated content – you must edit the content to ensure it reflects your understanding, has your voice and intellectual input, and conforms with course materials, syntax, terminology, and style. Additionally, the prompt you use cannot be copied and pasted directly from the assignment; you must create a prompt yourself.\n\nYou must also explicitly cite work submitted that is based on AI-generated content. You may use these guidelines to cite AI-generated content. The bare minimum citation must include the AI tool you’re using (e.g., ChatGPT), the model the tool uses, the date when you ran the prompt, and a link to the full transcript of the session starting with your prompt. A new citation must be included for each exercise where you used AI tools, with a new link to the full transceript of the interaction.\n\n AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use AI tools to generate a narrative that you then copy-paste verbatim into an assignment or edit and then insert into your assignment.\n AI tools for learning: You’re welcomed to ask AI tools questions that might help your learning and understanding in this course. However you should be critical of the answers you receive, as AI-generated content may not always be accurate or reliable. Use it to supplement your understanding, not as a substitute for learning.\n\nIn general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. Identifying AI-generated content is fairly straightforward. Any code identified as AI-generated but not cited as such and any narrative identified as AI-generated will be considered plagiarism and treated as such, resulting in a 0 for the relevant portion of the assignment.\n\nIf you are unsure if using a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a teaching team member.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will\n\nautomatically result in a 0 for the relevant portion or the entire assignment,\ncan further impact your overall course grade, and\nwill be reported to the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards for further action.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for homework assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback in a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework assignment and lowest 2 lab assignments will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework assignments may be submitted up to 3 days late. A 5% deduction will be applied for each 24-hour period during which the assignment is late.\nNo late work is accepted for labs since these are designed to be completed in class.\nNo late work is accepted for exams.\nNo late work is accepted for projects.\n\n\n\nOne-time late penalty waiver\nIf circumstances prevent you from completing a homework by the stated due date, you may email the course coordinator, Dr. Mary Knox, before the deadline to request to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide an explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it wisely. The waiver may only be used for homework assignments, not for attendance/participation, labs, exams, or the project.\nIf circumstances have a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your Quad advisor or academic dean know. They can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting them.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week after an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Regrade requests are also not a mechanism for asking for clarification on feedback, those questions should be brought to office hours. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire assignment may be regraded, which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final exam has been administered.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nEvery student is expected to attend and participate in lecture and labs and a portion of your grade depends on this. There may be times, however, when you cannot attend class. Lecture recordings are available upon request for students who have an excused absence. See the Lecture recording request policy for more detail. If you miss a lecture, make sure to review the material and complete the application exercise, if applicable, before the next lecture. Labs are dedicated to completing the lab assignment and collaborating with your lab team and there is no way to make up for missing a lab.\nMore details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\n\n\nLecture recording request\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week after the lecture date. To request a particular lecture’s video, please fill out the form at the link below. Please submit the form within 24 hours of missing lecture to ensure you have sufficient time to watch the recording. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as incapacitation forms, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.\n🔗 https://forms.cloud.microsoft/r/jwFuhygVw5\nAbout one week before each exam, the class recordings will be available to all students. These recordings will be available until the start of the exam.",

SDAO will work with you to determine what accommodations are appropriate for your situation. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations cannot be provided until a Faculty Accommodation Letter has been given to me. Please contact SDAO for more information: sdao@duke.edu or access.duke.edu.\n\n\nReligious accommodations\nStudents are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time.
