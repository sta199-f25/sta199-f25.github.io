Many took introductory courses (e.g., CS101, AP CS A) and are comfortable with basic programming constructs. Proficiency is generally highest in Python and Java, though some only have a little experience with languages like R, C/C++, and JavaScript. Quite a few have only used programming languages for specific classes or research projects and may not feel confident after a long break. Some students have experience with more niche or specialized tools such as MATLAB, SAS, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JS frameworks). Many express a need for a refresher if not used recently. In summary, while a core group is comfortable with at least one language, especially Python or Java, many others have only basic to moderate experience and express the desire to gain more proficiency."

Many took introductory courses (e.g., CS101, AP CS A) and are comfortable with basic programming constructs. Proficiency is generally highest in Python and Java, though some only have a little experience with languages like R, C/C++, and JavaScript. Quite a few have only used programming languages for specific classes or research projects and may not feel confident after a long break. Some students have experience with more niche or specialized tools such as MATLAB, SAS, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JS frameworks). Many express a need for a refresher if not used recently. In summary, while a core group is comfortable with at least one language, especially Python or Java, many others have only basic to moderate experience and express the desire to gain more proficiency.\n\nMathematica is a software system used for mathematics.\n\nsurvey |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(programming_languages, \"Mathematica\")) |&gt;\n  select(programming_languages)\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 1\n  programming_languages                                           \n  &lt;chr&gt;                                                           \n1 Most familiar to least: Java, Mathematica, Python, Matlab, React\n\n\n. . .\nNextflow extends the Unix pipes model with a DSL.\n\nsurvey |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(programming_languages, \"Nextflow\"))  |&gt;\n  select(programming_languages)\n\n# A tibble: 0 √ó 1\n# ‚Ñπ 1 variable: programming_languages &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n. . .\nPsycoPy is a desktop application for in-lab studies.\n\nsurvey |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(programming_languages, \"PsycoPy\"))  |&gt;\n  select(programming_languages)\n\n# A tibble: 0 √ó 1\n# ‚Ñπ 1 variable: programming_languages &lt;chr&gt;"

For example, you can create the first plot with:\n\nggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Population density\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    title = \"Population density of Midwestern counties\",\n    subtitle = \"Binwidth = 100\"\n  )\n\nYou will need to make four different histograms. Make sure to set informative titles and axis labels for each of your plots. Then, comment on which binwidth is most appropriate for these data and why.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 1‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 2\nVisualize the distribution of population density of counties again, this time using a boxplot with geom_boxplot(). Make sure to set informative titles and axis labels for your plot. Then, using information as needed from the box plot as well as the histogram from Question 1, describe the distribution of population density of counties and comment on any potential outliers, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative and commenting on whether it makes sense to you that this county is an outlier. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn describing a distribution, make sure to mention shape, center, spread, and any unusual observations.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 2‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 3\nCreate a scatterplot of the percentage below poverty (percbelowpoverty on the y-axis) versus percentage of people with a college degree (percollege on the x-axis), where the color and shape of points are determined by state. Make sure to set informative titles, axis, and legend labels for your plot. First, describe the overall relationship between percentage of people with a college degree and percentage below poverty in Midwestern states, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them. Then, comment on whether you can identify how this relationship varies across states.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 3‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 4\nDo some states have counties that tend to be geographically larger than others?\nTo explore this question, create side-by-side boxplots of area (area) of a county based on state (state).\nHow do typical county area sizes compare across states?\nHow do variabilities of county sizes compare across states?\nWhich state has the single largest county? Identify the name of this county. You can use the data viewer to identify it interactively, you do not have to write code.\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.\nOnce again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n\nQuestion 5\nDo some states have a higher percentage of their counties located in a metropolitan area?\nCreate a segmented bar plot with one bar per state and the bar filled with colors according to the value of metro ‚Äì one color indicating Yes and the other color indicating No for whether a county is considered to be a metro area. The y-axis of the segmented barplot should range from 0 to 1, indicating proportions. Compare the percentage of counties in metro areas across the states based on this plot. Make sure to supplement your narrative with rough estimates of these percentages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nFor this question, you should begin with the data wrangling pipeline below. We will learn more about data wrangling in the coming weeks, so this is a mini-preview. This pipeline creates a new variable called metro based on the value of the existing variable called inmetro. If the value of inmetro is equal to 1 (inmetro == 1), it sets the value of metro to \"Yes\", and if not, it sets the value of metro to \"No\". The resulting data frame is assigned back to midwest, overwriting the existing midwest data frame with a version that includes the new metro variable.\n\nmidwest &lt;- midwest |&gt;\n  mutate(metro = if_else(inmetro == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\n\n\n\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.\nAnd once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward. We keep repeating this because it‚Äôs important and because we see students forget to do this. So take a moment to make sure you‚Äôre following along with the version control instructions."

    "text": "Questions 7-10 ‚Äì Exploring NC Counties\nPackages\nYou will use the tidyverse package for data wrangling and visualization, scales for better axis labels, and ggthemes for additional color palettes.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\nData\nFor the remaining questions on the homework, you will continue use data on counties in North Carolina that you used in Lab 1.\nAs a reminder, the dataset contains information on North Carolina counties retrieved from the 2020 Census as well as from myFutureNC Dashboard maintained by Carolina Demography at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nThis dataset is stored in a file called nc-county.csv in the data folder of your project/repository.\nThe variables in the dataset and their descriptions are as follows:\n\n\ncounty: Name of county.\n\nland_area_m2: Land area of county in meters-squared, based on the 2020 census.\n\nland_area_mi2: Land area of county in miles-squared, based on the 2020 census.\n\npop_2020: Population of county, based on the 2020 Census.\n\npop_dens_2020: Population density calculated as population (pop_2020) divided by land area in miles-squared (people per mile-squared).\n\ncounty_type: Peer county type classification based on population characteristics, socioeconomic status, and geographic features used for grouping counties with similar demographic, social, and economic characteristics, allowing them to be compared and benchmarked against one another.\n\nmedian_hh_income: Median household income.\n\np_foreign_born: Percentage of population that is foreign-born.\n\np_child_poverty: Percentage of children living in poverty.\n\np_single_parent_hh: Percentage of households with children that are single-parent households.\n\np_broadband: Percentage of households with broadband internet access.\n\np_home_ownership: Percentage of homes that are owner-occupied.\n\np_family_sustaining_wage: Percentage of adults that earn a family-sustaining wage ‚Äì typically a wage that covers essential costs like housing, food, childcare, transportation, and healthcare for a family‚Äôs basic needs within a specific geographic area\n\np_edu_lths: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with less than a high school diploma.\n\np_edu_hsged: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with a high school diploma or equivalent.\n\np_edu_scnd: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with some college or an associate degree.\n\np_edu_ndc: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with non-degree credentials ‚Äì certifications, licenses, or other credentials that demonstrate specific skills or knowledge but do not confer a formal academic degree.\n\np_edu_assoc: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with an associate degree.\n\np_edu_ba: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with a bachelor‚Äôs degree.\n\np_edu_mapl: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with a master‚Äôs, professional, or doctoral degree.\n\np_edu_hs_grad_rate: High school graduation rate.\n\np_edu_chronic_absent_rate: Chronic absenteeism rate.\n\nJust like in lab, you can read this file into R with the following code:\n\nnc_county &lt;- read_csv(\"data/nc-county.csv\")\n\nQuestion 7\n\nMake a bar plot of the number of counties by county_type. What type of county is most common in North Carolina? What type of county is least common?\nWhat type of county is Durham County? Answer this question with a single pipeline where you filter() for Durham County and then select() the county and county_type variables.\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 7‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 8\n\nMake a boxplot of median household income (median_hh_income) by county_type. In 2-3 sentences, compare the distributions of median household income across the four county types touching on shape, center, spread, and any potential outliers.\n\nIn a single pipeline, identify all rural non-metro counties that appear as outliers in the boxplot you created in part (a). Your result should be a data frame with columns county, county_type, and median_hh_income. (Hint: Use filter() with two conditions connected by the & operator.)\nThen, fill in the blanks in the following sentence:\n\nThere are _____ rural non-metro counties that appear as outliers with median household incomes above $_____. The county with the highest median household income among these outliers is _____ County, with a median household income of $_____.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nYou will need to use two conditions connected by the & operator in your filter() call to filter for counties with rural non-metro type and (&) with median household income beyond a certain threshold.\n\n\n\nFigure out where the counties you identified in part (b) are located in North Carolina, e.g., on the coast, on the northwest, etc. Include in your answer where you found this information with links to your references, e.g., Wikipedia, Google Maps, etc.\n\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.\n\nQuestion 9\n\nMake a boxplot of the proportion of 25-44-year-olds with a master‚Äôs, professional, or doctoral degree (p_edu_mapl) by county_type. How do the median proportions compare across the four county types?\n\nIn a single pipeline, identify all counties that appear as outliers in the boxplot you created in part (a). Your result should be a data frame with columns county, county_type, and p_edu_mapl, where rows are ordered by county_type and then in descending order of p_edu_mapl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nYou will need to use three conditions connected by the | operator in your filter() call, one for each county type.\n\n\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.\n\nQuestion 10\nRecreate the following visualization that compares the distribution of home ownership (p_home_ownership) by county_type. Then, highlight one feature of home ownership that this plot reveals in 1-2 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\nx-axis: You can modify the x-axis labels to be percentages in a scale_x_continuous() layer. The scales package offers a handy function for formatting percentages, label_percent(). You can use this in the labels argument of scale_x_continuous().\nColor palette: The scale_color_colorblind() and scale_fill_colorblind() functions from the ggthemes package provide a color palette that is friendly for individuals with color vision deficiencies.\nTransparancy: You should adjust the transparency of the filled density curves. You don‚Äôt have to worry about the exact transparency value, but you should try a few to get close.\nTheme: This plot uses a non-default theme. See theme options documentation for options.\nLegend: You should move the legend to the top of the plot. You can do this in a theme() layer. See theme documentation to identify the argument you need to change to move the legend.\nAspect ratio: You can adjust the aspect ratio by setting the fig-asp option in the code cell. A smaller (closer to 0) value makes the plot shorter and wider, while a larger (closer to 1) value makes the plot square-ish.\n\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward."

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I‚Äôd rather you didn‚Äôt, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we‚Äôre using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you‚Äôre working in the containers we have provided for you. If you‚Äôre working on your local setup, we can‚Äôt guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we‚Äôre happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.5.1: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nInstall Quarto 1.7.32 or higher: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I‚Äôd like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here.",

    "text": "Mise en place (French pronunciation: [mi z…ëÃÉ Ààplas]) is a French culinary phrase which means ‚Äúputting in place‚Äù or ‚Äúgather‚Äù. It refers to the setup required before cooking, and is often used in professional kitchens to refer to organizing and arranging the ingredients (e.g., cuts of meat, relishes, sauces, par-cooked items, spices, freshly chopped vegetables, and other components) that a cook will require for the menu items that are expected to be prepared during a shift.1\nThis lab is all about setting up your computing environment for the course and putting in place all the bits and bobbles you‚Äôll need for the rest of the semester and it‚Äôs about getting to know each other and the teaching team.\nAnd just like the mise an place phase for cooking something that is new to you, it might not be entirely clear how everything will come together at the end. Hang in there, and it‚Äôll all start to make sense by the end of the week. And you‚Äôll be a pro at it all just in time for the first assignment!"

    "text": "Computational toolkit\nYou may have heard/seen this phrase, Hello, World!, elsewhere before. It‚Äôs usually the first thing you learn in programming ‚Äì to learn to write a computer program to print this sentence to screen. Things will be different in this course, as it‚Äôs not a programming, but a data science course. So, starting tomorrow in class, you‚Äôll learn to use a computing language (called R) to work with data.\nBut today, we need to set you up for success! Let‚Äôs first briefly review the components of the computational toolkit for the course:\n\nR: The programming language you‚Äôll learn in this course.\n\nRStudio: The piece of software (a.k.a. the integrated development environment, IDE) you‚Äôll use to write R code in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.\n\n\n\n\nQuarto: The tool you‚Äôll use to create reproducible computational documents that contain both your narrative (i.e., words in English) and your code (i.e., code in R). Every piece of assignment you hand in will be a Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou might be familiar with word processors like MS Word or Google Docs. We will not be using these in this class. Instead, the words you would write in such a document as well as the code will go into a Quarto document, and when you render the document (more on what this means later) you will get a document out that has your words, your code, and the output of that code. Everything in one place, beautifully formatted!\n\n\n\nGit: Version control system.\n\nGitHub: A web hosting service for the Git version control system that also allows for transparent collaboration between team members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGit is a version control system (like ‚ÄúTrack Changes‚Äù features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better)."

You would need to pick a language (e.g.¬†English) and choose an interface to write your document with (such as Microsoft word with a .docx word doc). You also might want to use track changes to see edits you make and use a platform such as Google Drive to collaborate.\n\nWhile the computational toolkit is different than the one for a literature class, we can find many similarities between the tools, as is shown in the figure below."

    "text": "This lab will introduce you to the course computing workflow. One of the mail goals of this lab is to reinforce our demo of R and RStudio, which we will be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions. The other main goal is meet other students in the class, get to know them, and work together with them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface, commonly referred to as an integrated development environment or an IDE, for short.\n\n\nAn additional goal is to reinforce Git and GitHub, the version control, web hosting, and collaboration systems that we will be using throughout the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGit is a version control system (like ‚ÄúTrack Changes‚Äù features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).\n\n\nAs the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis lab assumes that you have already completed Lab 0. If you have not, please\n\ngo back and do that first before proceeding and\nlet your TA know as they will need to set up a Lab 1 repository for you before you can complete this lab.\n\n\n\n\n\nGain practice with\n\nthe data science workflow using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub,\nwriting a reproducible report using Quarto, and\nversion control using Git and GitHub.\n\n\nCreate data visualizations with the tidyverse, specifically using ggplot2.\nWrite a simple data transformation pipeline with the tidyverse, specifically using dplyr.\n\n\n\nGo to https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers and login with your Duke NetID and Password.\nClick STA199 under My reservations to log into your container. You should now see the RStudio environment.\n\n\nBelow are the components of the RStudio IDE.\n\n\n\n\nBelow are the components of a Quarto (.qmd) file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the course organization at github.com/sta199-f25 organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix lab-1. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\nClick on the green CODE button, select Use SSH (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you‚Äôll see the text Clone with SSH). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\nIn RStudio, go to File ‚ûõ New Project ‚ûõVersion Control ‚ûõ Git.\nCopy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box Repository URL. Again, please make sure to have SSH highlighted under Clone when you copy the address.\nClick Create Project, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the Files pane in RStudio.\nClick lab-1.qmd to open the template Quarto file. This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.\n\nThe top portion of your Quarto file (between the three dashed lines) is called YAML. It stands for ‚ÄúYAML Ain‚Äôt Markup Language‚Äù. It is a human-friendly data representation for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\nOpen the Quarto (.qmd) file in your project, update the authors field to add your name first (first and last) and then your teammates‚Äô names (first and last). Then, render the document.\nIf you get a popup window error, click ‚ÄúTry again‚Äù.\nExamine the rendered document and make sure your name is updated in the document.\n\n\n\nGo to the Git pane in RStudio. This will be in the top right hand corner in a separate tab.\nIf you have made changes to your Quarto (.qmd) file, you should see it listed here. If you have rendered the document, you should also see its output, a PDF file, listed there.\n\n\nClick on it to select it in this list and then click on Diff.\nThis shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre happy with these changes, prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository.\n\nFirst, stage your changes by checking the appropriate box on the files you want to prepare.\nNext, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, ‚ÄúUpdated author name‚Äù) in the Commit message box.\nFinally, click Commit. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration (e.g., restoring a previous version of your document).\nIn the first few assignments, we will tell you exactly when to commit and, in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses, we will let you make these decisions.\n\n\n\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it‚Äôs time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.\n\nIn the Git pane, click on Push.\nThen, make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo in your browser and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub, and you‚Äôre good to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you don‚Äôt see your update, go back to Step 4. Remember that in order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have staged (checked boxes) your commit (with a commit message) to be pushed and then click on Push.\n\n\n\n\nCode should follow the tidyverse style. Particularly,\n\nthere should be spaces before and line breaks after each + when building a ggplot,\nthere should also be spaces before and line breaks after each |&gt; in a data transformation pipeline,\ncode should be properly indented,\nthere should be spaces around = signs and spaces after commas.\n\nAdditionally, all code should be visible in the PDF output, i.e., should not run off the page on the PDF.

I intend to present materials and activities that respect diversity and align with Duke‚Äôs Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences and honors their identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don‚Äôt hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If anything was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a teaching team member know.\n\n\n\nPersonal pronouns\nUsing pronouns can help foster a respectful campus environment where all community members can thrive. Sharing pronouns is always optional for members of the Duke community. If you would like to share yours, you can update them in DukeHub. You can learn more at the DukeHub & Zoom Tutorials.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf any portion of the course is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students can engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should contact the SDAO to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website: sta199-f25.github.io.\nAnnouncements will periodically be emailed through Canvas Announcements.

    "text": "Five tips for success\nYour success in this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it. The course has been organized so that the burden of learning is on you. Your TAs and I will help you by providing you with materials answering questions, and setting a pace, but for this to work, you must do the following:\n\nWatch the videos and do the readings before each class.\n\nCome prepared so you can deeply engage with the material during lectures and labs instead of using class time to learn the basics.\n\nBe present and engaged in every lecture and lab.\n\nIn lectures do the application exercises, ask questions, and participate in discussions. In labs, work on the lab exercises, ask questions, and collaborate with your teammates. If you miss a class, make sure to catch up on the material before the next class.\n\nAsk questions.\n\nAs often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you‚Äôre not sure about the lab, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\n\nDo the homework.\n\nThe earlier you start, the better. It‚Äôs not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example).\n\nDon‚Äôt procrastinate.\n\nThe content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don‚Äôt let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the class discussion forum, Ed Discussion. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on the forum before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question, I encourage you to respond!\n\nCheck out the Support tab for more resources.",

    "text": "Course components\n\nLectures\nLectures designed to be interactive, so you gain experience applying new concepts and learning from each other. My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and use them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, most lectures will feature application exercises that will serve as opportunities to practice what you‚Äôre learning as you‚Äôre learning it and be great preparation for the assignments and exams. You are expected to prepare for these by completing assigned readings and videos.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop (or Chromebook) to each class so that you can participate in the application activities. Please ensure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone. A tablet also works, but the user experience will be much smoother on a laptop.\n\n\nLabs\nLabs are designed to be hands-on at all times, therefore you‚Äôre similarly expected to bring a laptop to each lab session.\nDuring labs you will get a brief introduction to the week‚Äôs assignments from your TA and then work on the lab exercise with your teammates. You will often also have time to start working on your homework assignment during lab, once you complete the lab exercise.\n\n\nTeams\nYou will start off the semester in randomly assigned teams for each lab session for the first few weeks. Then, you will be assigned to a project team that you will work with for the remainder of the semester.\nAll team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of the project, and you will be asked to evaluate your team members throughout the semester. Failure to adequately contribute to any project component will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team‚Äôs overall mark. You are expected to use the provided GitHub repository as the central collaborative platform. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member‚Äôs relative contribution to each project.\n\n\nActivities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on seven components: lecture, lab, homework, project, two exams, a final, and attendance and participation.\n\nLectures\nAttendance and participation will be tracked through in-class questions via Wooclap, which you can access on your laptop or phone. You will earn points for answering questions during lecture, and these points will contribute to your attendance and participation grade.\nThere are 26 lectures during the semester. You must participate in Wooclap questions in at least 18 lectures to get full credit on this component. Otherwise your grade on this component will be calculated as the percentage of lectures you attended and participated, e.g., if you attend and participate in 22/26 lectures, you get the full 5% but if you attend and participate in 15/26 lectures, you get (15/26)5% = 2.88%.\nApplication exercises won‚Äôt be graded directly, but we will track activity on them to ensure you‚Äôre staying engaged with the course and exams will feature topics and questions from these exercises.\n\n\nLabs\nIn the first few weeks of the semester, you will be randomly assigned to a team and work with your teammates on an exercise that is due at the end of the lab session. Once project teams are formed, you will work with that team on the lab exercises. You must be present in lab to complete the lab assignment. There is no way to make up for missing a lab.\nYou will submit your lab assignments by pushing your work to your GitHub repository for the lab and submitting the PDF output on Gradescope by the end of your lab session.\nThere are eight graded labs in the semester. The lowest two lab grades will be dropped at the end of the semester, which means you can miss up to two lab sessions with no penalty.\n\n\nHomework\nYou will complete homework assignments individually. You may start working on your homeowork assignment during your lab session, once you complete your lab exercise, but you will need to finish it outside of class. Your homework will be comprised of some practice exercises where you can get immediate feedback from AI tools designed for this course and some graded exercises.\nYou will submit your homework assignments by pushing your work to your GitHub repository for the homework and submitting the PDF output on Gradescope by 11:59pm on Sundays.\nThere are six graded homework assignments in the semester. The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester, which means you can miss one homework assignment with no penalty.\n\n\nExams\nThis course will have three exams: two exams and a final. The exams will include an in-class component (with a cheat sheet) and an open-note take-home component, while the final will include only an in-class component (with a cheat sheet).\nYou can demonstrate what you‚Äôve learned in the course thus far through these exams. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The exam‚Äôs content will be related to the content in videos and reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, and labs.\nYou will submit your take-home exam by pushing your work to your GitHub repository for the exam and submitting the PDF output on Gradescope by the stated deadline on the schedule.\n\n\nProject\nThe project aims to apply what you‚Äôve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed in teams, and each team will present their work during a lab session in the latter part of the semester. The write-up will be due on the same day.\nYou cannot pass this course if you have not completed the project.\nMore information about the project will be provided during the semester.",

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nDuke Community Standard\nAs a student in this course, you have agreed to uphold the Duke Community Standard and the practices specific to this course.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don‚Äôt cheat!\n\nWhat is allowed and what is not?\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nCollaboration: Only work that is clearly assigned as teamwork should be completed collaboratively. On individual assignments, you may not directly share work (including code) with another student in this class; on team assignments, you may not directly share work (including code) with another team. ‚ÄúSharing‚Äù includes, but is not limited to, messaging, emailing, or otherwise providing your work to another student or team.\n\nLabs: Collaboration in teams for lab assignments is not only allowed but expected. You will work together with your lab team to complete the lab exercise. However, each student must submit their own write-up of the lab exercise, which should reflect their understanding and ideas. It‚Äôs expected that lab submission will be similar across team members.\nProject: Similarly, collaboration within teams is not only allowed but expected for the project. The difference is that the project is a single, collaborative work developed by the entire team. It is the team‚Äôs responsibility to make sure all components of the project are vetted and revised by all team members, even if some division of labor takes place for first drafts of components. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed; however, you may not share code or project components across teams.\nHomework: You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write-up with other students. For homework assignments, sharing (or copying) of the code or write-up will be considered a violation for all students involved, regardless of who initiated the sharing.\nExams: You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams (in class and take home). On exams, collaboration, sharing (or copying) of the code, or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved, regardless of who initiated the sharing.\n\nUse of online resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course‚Äôs policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow), but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, resulting in an automatic 0 for the relevant portion of the assignment.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, like other online resources. Two guiding principles govern how to use AI in this course:\n\nCognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your thinking ability. We will practice using AI to facilitate‚Äîrather than hinder‚Äîlearning.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and ensure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n AI tools for code: You may use generative AI tools when you need help with assignments. However you should first attempt to solve the problem yourself. Your submission should not be a copy-paste of AI-generated content ‚Äì you must edit the content to ensure it reflects your understanding, has your voice and intellectual input, and conforms with course materials, syntax, terminology, and style. Additionally, the prompt you use cannot be copied and pasted directly from the assignment; you must create a prompt yourself.\n\nYou must also explicitly cite work submitted that is based on AI-generated content. You may use these guidelines to cite AI-generated content. The bare minimum citation must include the AI tool you‚Äôre using (e.g., ChatGPT), the model the tool uses, the date when you ran the prompt, and a link to the full transcript of the session starting with your prompt. A new citation must be included for each exercise where you used AI tools, with a new link to the full transceript of the interaction.\n\n AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use AI tools to generate a narrative that you then copy-paste verbatim into an assignment or edit and then insert into your assignment.\n AI tools for learning: You‚Äôre welcomed to ask AI tools questions that might help your learning and understanding in this course. However you should be critical of the answers you receive, as AI-generated content may not always be accurate or reliable. Use it to supplement your understanding, not as a substitute for learning.\n\nIn general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. Identifying AI-generated content is fairly straightforward. Any code identified as AI-generated but not cited as such and any narrative identified as AI-generated will be treated as plagiarism, resulting in an automatic 0 for the relevant portion of the assignment.\n\nIf you are unsure if using a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a teaching team member.\n\n\nWhat happens if you violate the academic honesty policy?\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course\n\nwill automatically result in a 0 for the relevant portion or the entire assignment or assessment,\ncan result in further deductions to your overall course grade (e.g., drop down to the next letter grade or drop down to an F), and\ncan be reported to the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards for further action.\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one‚Äôs own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for homework assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback in a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework assignment and lowest 2 lab assignments will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework assignments may be submitted up to 3 days late. A 5% deduction will be applied for each 24-hour period during which the assignment is late.\nNo late work is accepted for labs since these are designed to be completed in class.\nNo late work is accepted for exams.\nNo late work is accepted for projects.\n\n\n\nOne-time late penalty waiver\nIf circumstances prevent you from completing a homework by the stated due date, you may email the course coordinator, Dr.¬†Mary Knox, before the deadline to request to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide an explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it wisely. The waiver may only be used for homework assignments, not for attendance/participation, labs, exams, or the project.\nIf circumstances have a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your Quad advisor or academic dean know. They can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting them.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week after an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Regrade requests are also not a mechanism for asking for clarification on feedback, those questions should be brought to office hours. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire assignment may be regraded, which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final exam has been administered.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nEvery student is expected to attend and participate in lecture and labs and a portion of your grade depends on this. There may be times, however, when you cannot attend class. Lecture recordings are available upon request for students who have an excused absence. See the Lecture recording request policy for more detail. If you miss a lecture, make sure to review the material and complete the application exercise, if applicable, before the next lecture. Labs are dedicated to completing the lab assignment and collaborating with your lab team and there is no way to make up for missing a lab.\nMore details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\n\n\nLecture recording request\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week after the lecture date. To request a particular lecture‚Äôs video, please fill out the form at the link below. Please submit the form within 24 hours of missing lecture to ensure you have sufficient time to watch the recording. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as incapacitation forms, Dean‚Äôs excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.\nüîó https://forms.cloud.microsoft/r/jwFuhygVw5\nAbout one week before each exam, the class recordings will be available to all students. These recordings will be available until the start of the exam.",
