The following is one acceptable description that touches on the shape, center, and spread of this distribution. Calculate the values that should go into the blanks.\n\nThe distribution of population density of counties is unimodal and extremely right-skewed. A typical Midwestern county has population density of ____ people per unit area. The middle 50% of the counties have population densities between ____ to ____ people per unit area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThink about which measures of center and spread are appropriate for skewed distributions.\n\n\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.\nOnce again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n\nQuestion 5\nAnother visualization from HW 1 was the following, which showed the proportion of urban (located in metropolitan area) counties in each state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate these proportions in a single data pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember, you‚Äôll first need to create a new variable called metro which takes on the value Yes if the value of inmetro is 1, and No otherwise. You can refer to HW 1 if you need a refresher on how to do this.\n\n\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.\nAnd once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.

You can use the same approach here.\nPoints: The points are drawn with the geom_beeswarm() function from the ggbeeswarm package.\nOutliers: The outliers in the box plots are drawn as open circles. You can specify this with the outlier.shape argument in geom_boxplot(). You can also adjust the size of the outliers with the outlier.size argument. The ggplot2 aesthetic specifications documentation has a list of shape names you can use for help.\nColor palette: The colors for the box plots are manually specified in a scale_color_manual() layer. You do not need to worry about the exact colors, but you should try to get close, e.g., use blue-ish colors for Rural counties, red-ish for Suburban, and brown-ish for Urban. You can use HEX codes for colors or look up named colors in R in the R colors cheatsheet\nTransparancy: You should adjust the transparency of the box plots. You don‚Äôt have to worry about the exact transparency value, but you should try to get close.\nTheme: This plot uses a non-default theme. See theme options documentation for options.\nAspect ratio and width: You can adjust the aspect ratio and width of your plot in your rendered document by setting fig-asp and fig-width options in the code cell.\n\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 7‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 8\nIn a single pipeline, identify the outliers in the plot in the previous question, and return a data frame with the county name, county type, percentage with higher education. This data frame should be arranged in ascending order of county type and descending order of percentage with higher education.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 8‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 9\nCreate a scatter plot with percentage of 25-44 year olds with higher education (p_edu_he) on the x-axis and median household income (median_hh_income) on the y-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables. In your description, make sure to comment on the direction, form, strength, and any unusual observations. For unusual observations, identify the counties that correspond to these observations, and make sure to include the code you used to identify them as part of your answer. Your code should output the county name, percentage with higher education, and median household income for each unusual observation.\nRequirements for the plot (in addition to the requirements in the overall assignment guidelines:\n\nThe x-axis should be formatted as percentages, e.g., 30%, not 0.3.\nThe y-axis should be formatted as dollar amounts, e.g., $40,000, not 4e+04.\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.\n\nQuestion 10\nCome up with a question that you could answer with the nc_county data frame and the new p_edu_he variable you created in Question 6 and state it explicitly. Then, answer your question with an appropriate data visualization and/or data transformation pipeline and a brief description of your findings.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.

We first filter the dataset for any shows that have romance or comedy as their genre (genre_1, genre_2, or genre_3) and then remove shows that have both of these genre labels.

Many took introductory courses (e.g., CS101, AP CS A) and are comfortable with basic programming constructs. Proficiency is generally highest in Python and Java, though some only have a little experience with languages like R, C/C++, and JavaScript. Quite a few have only used programming languages for specific classes or research projects and may not feel confident after a long break. Some students have experience with more niche or specialized tools such as MATLAB, SAS, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JS frameworks). Many express a need for a refresher if not used recently. In summary, while a core group is comfortable with at least one language, especially Python or Java, many others have only basic to moderate experience and express the desire to gain more proficiency."

Many took introductory courses (e.g., CS101, AP CS A) and are comfortable with basic programming constructs. Proficiency is generally highest in Python and Java, though some only have a little experience with languages like R, C/C++, and JavaScript. Quite a few have only used programming languages for specific classes or research projects and may not feel confident after a long break. Some students have experience with more niche or specialized tools such as MATLAB, SAS, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JS frameworks). Many express a need for a refresher if not used recently. In summary, while a core group is comfortable with at least one language, especially Python or Java, many others have only basic to moderate experience and express the desire to gain more proficiency.\n\nMathematica is a software system used for mathematics.\n\nsurvey |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(programming_languages, \"Mathematica\")) |&gt;\n  select(programming_languages)\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 1\n  programming_languages                                           \n  &lt;chr&gt;                                                           \n1 Most familiar to least: Java, Mathematica, Python, Matlab, React\n\n\n. . .\nNextflow extends the Unix pipes model with a DSL.\n\nsurvey |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(programming_languages, \"Nextflow\"))  |&gt;\n  select(programming_languages)\n\n# A tibble: 0 √ó 1\n# ‚Ñπ 1 variable: programming_languages &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n. . .\nPsycoPy is a desktop application for in-lab studies.\n\nsurvey |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(programming_languages, \"PsycoPy\"))  |&gt;\n  select(programming_languages)\n\n# A tibble: 0 √ó 1\n# ‚Ñπ 1 variable: programming_languages &lt;chr&gt;"

Many took introductory courses (e.g., CS101, AP CS A) and are comfortable with basic programming constructs. Proficiency is generally highest in Python and Java, though some only have a little experience with languages like R, C/C++, and JavaScript. Quite a few have only used programming languages for specific classes or research projects and may not feel confident after a long break. Some students have experience with more niche or specialized tools such as MATLAB, SAS, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JS frameworks). Many express a need for a refresher if not used recently.

Many took introductory courses (e.g., CS101, AP CS A) and are comfortable with basic programming constructs. Proficiency is generally highest in Python and Java, though some only have a little experience with languages like R, C/C++, and JavaScript. Quite a few have only used programming languages for specific classes or research projects and may not feel confident after a long break. Some students have experience with more niche or specialized tools such as MATLAB, SAS, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JS frameworks). Many express a need for a refresher if not used recently. In summary, while a core group is comfortable with at least one language, especially Python or Java, many others have only basic to moderate experience and express the desire to gain more proficiency."

Many took introductory courses (e.g., CS101, AP CS A) and are comfortable with basic programming constructs. Proficiency is generally highest in Python and Java, though some only have a little experience with languages like R, C/C++, and JavaScript.

Many took introductory courses (e.g., CS101, AP CS A) and are comfortable with basic programming constructs. Proficiency is generally highest in Python and Java, though some only have a little experience with languages like R, C/C++, and JavaScript. Quite a few have only used programming languages for specific classes or research projects and may not feel confident after a long break. Some students have experience with more niche or specialized tools such as MATLAB, SAS, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JS frameworks). Many express a need for a refresher if not used recently. In summary, while a core group is comfortable with at least one language, especially Python or Java, many others have only basic to moderate experience and express the desire to gain more proficiency."

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I‚Äôd rather you didn‚Äôt, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we‚Äôre using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you‚Äôre working in the containers we have provided for you. If you‚Äôre working on your local setup, we can‚Äôt guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we‚Äôre happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.5.1: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nInstall Quarto 1.7.32 or higher: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I‚Äôd like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here.",

    "text": "This lab will introduce you to the course computing workflow. One of the mail goals of this lab is to reinforce our demo of R and RStudio, which we will be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions. The other main goal is meet other students in the class, get to know them, and work together with them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface, commonly referred to as an integrated development environment or an IDE, for short.\n\n\nAn additional goal is to reinforce Git and GitHub, the version control, web hosting, and collaboration systems that we will be using throughout the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGit is a version control system (like ‚ÄúTrack Changes‚Äù features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).\n\n\nAs the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis lab assumes that you have already completed Lab 0. If you have not, please\n\ngo back and do that first before proceeding and\nlet your TA know as they will need to set up a Lab 1 repository for you before you can complete this lab.\n\n\n\n\n\nGain practice with\n\nthe data science workflow using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub,\nwriting a reproducible report using Quarto, and\nversion control using Git and GitHub.\n\n\nCreate data visualizations with the tidyverse, specifically using ggplot2.\nWrite a simple data transformation pipeline with the tidyverse, specifically using dplyr.\n\n\n\nGo to https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers and login with your Duke NetID and Password.\nClick STA199 under My reservations to log into your container. You should now see the RStudio environment.\n\n\nBelow are the components of the RStudio IDE.\n\n\n\n\nBelow are the components of a Quarto (.qmd) file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the course organization at github.com/sta199-f25 organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix lab-1. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\nClick on the green CODE button, select Use SSH (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you‚Äôll see the text Clone with SSH). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\nIn RStudio, go to File ‚ûõ New Project ‚ûõVersion Control ‚ûõ Git.\nCopy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box Repository URL. Again, please make sure to have SSH highlighted under Clone when you copy the address.\nClick Create Project, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the Files pane in RStudio.\nClick lab-1.qmd to open the template Quarto file. This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.\n\nThe top portion of your Quarto file (between the three dashed lines) is called YAML. It stands for ‚ÄúYAML Ain‚Äôt Markup Language‚Äù. It is a human-friendly data representation for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\nOpen the Quarto (.qmd) file in your project, update the authors field to add your name first (first and last) and then your teammates‚Äô names (first and last). Then, render the document.\nIf you get a popup window error, click ‚ÄúTry again‚Äù.\nExamine the rendered document and make sure your name is updated in the document.\n\n\n\nGo to the Git pane in RStudio. This will be in the top right hand corner in a separate tab.\nIf you have made changes to your Quarto (.qmd) file, you should see it listed here. If you have rendered the document, you should also see its output, a PDF file, listed there.\n\n\nClick on it to select it in this list and then click on Diff.\nThis shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre happy with these changes, prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository.\n\nFirst, stage your changes by checking the appropriate box on the files you want to prepare.\nNext, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, ‚ÄúUpdated author name‚Äù) in the Commit message box.\nFinally, click Commit. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration (e.g., restoring a previous version of your document).\nIn the first few assignments, we will tell you exactly when to commit and, in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses, we will let you make these decisions.\n\n\n\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it‚Äôs time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.\n\nIn the Git pane, click on Push.\nThen, make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo in your browser and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub, and you‚Äôre good to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you don‚Äôt see your update, go back to Step 4. Remember that in order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have staged (checked boxes) your commit (with a commit message) to be pushed and then click on Push.\n\n\n\n\nCode should follow the tidyverse style. Particularly,\n\nthere should be spaces before and line breaks after each + when building a ggplot,\nthere should also be spaces before and line breaks after each |&gt; in a data transformation pipeline,\ncode should be properly indented,\nthere should be spaces around = signs and spaces after commas.\n\nAdditionally, all code should be visible in the PDF output, i.e., should not run off the page on the PDF. Long lines that run off the page should be split across multiple lines with line breaks.1\n\n\nPlots should have an informative title and, if needed, also a subtitle.\nAxes and legends should be labeled with both the variable name and its units (if applicable).\nCareful consideration should be given to aesthetic choices.\n\nContinuing to develop a sound workflow for reproducible data analysis is important as you complete the lab and other assignments in this course.\n\nYou should have at least 3 commits with meaningful commit messages by the end of the assignment.\nFinal versions of both your .qmd file and the rendered PDF should be pushed to GitHub."

Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration (e.g., restoring a previous version of your document).\nIn the first few assignments, we will tell you exactly when to commit and, in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses, we will let you make these decisions.\n\n\n\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it‚Äôs time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.\n\nIn the Git pane, click on Push.\nThen, make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo in your browser and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub, and you‚Äôre good to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you don‚Äôt see your update, go back to Step 4. Remember that in order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have staged (checked boxes) your commit (with a commit message) to be pushed and then click on Push."

I intend to present materials and activities that respect diversity and align with Duke‚Äôs Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences and honors their identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don‚Äôt hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If anything was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a teaching team member know.\n\n\n\nPersonal pronouns\nUsing pronouns can help foster a respectful campus environment where all community members can thrive. Sharing pronouns is always optional for members of the Duke community. If you would like to share yours, you can update them in DukeHub. You can learn more at the DukeHub & Zoom Tutorials.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf any portion of the course is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students can engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should contact the SDAO to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website: sta199-f25.github.io.\nAnnouncements will periodically be emailed through Canvas Announcements. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course.\n\n\nEmail\nIf you have questions about assignment extensions, accommodations, or any other matter not appropriate for the class discussion forum, please email me directly at mc301@duke.edu. If you do so, please include ‚ÄúSTA 199‚Äù in the subject line. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to STA 199 emails within 48 hours, Monday through Friday.

    "text": "Five tips for success\nYour success in this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it. The course has been organized so that the burden of learning is on you. Your TAs and I will help you by providing you with materials answering questions, and setting a pace, but for this to work, you must do the following:\n\nWatch the videos and do the readings before each class.\n\nCome prepared so you can deeply engage with the material during lectures and labs instead of using class time to learn the basics.\n\nBe present and engaged in every lecture and lab.\n\nIn lectures do the application exercises, ask questions, and participate in discussions. In labs, work on the lab exercises, ask questions, and collaborate with your teammates. If you miss a class, make sure to catch up on the material before the next class.\n\nAsk questions.\n\nAs often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you‚Äôre not sure about the lab, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\n\nDo the homework.\n\nThe earlier you start, the better. It‚Äôs not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example).\n\nDon‚Äôt procrastinate.\n\nThe content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don‚Äôt let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking, you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments.

    "text": "Course components\n\nLectures\nLectures designed to be interactive, so you gain experience applying new concepts and learning from each other. My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and use them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, most lectures will feature application exercises that will serve as opportunities to practice what you‚Äôre learning as you‚Äôre learning it and be great preparation for the assignments and exams. You are expected to prepare for these by completing assigned readings and videos.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop (or Chromebook) to each class so that you can participate in the application activities. Please ensure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone. A tablet also works, but the user experience will be much smoother on a laptop.\n\n\nLabs\nLabs are designed to be hands-on at all times, therefore you‚Äôre similarly expected to bring a laptop to each lab session.\nDuring labs you will get a brief introduction to the week‚Äôs assignments from your TA and then work on the lab exercise with your teammates. You will often also have time to start working on your homework assignment during lab, once you complete the lab exercise.\n\n\nTeams\nYou will start off the semester in randomly assigned teams for each lab session for the first few weeks. Then, you will be assigned to a project team that you will work with for the remainder of the semester.\nAll team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of the project, and you will be asked to evaluate your team members throughout the semester. Failure to adequately contribute to any project component will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team‚Äôs overall mark. You are expected to use the provided GitHub repository as the central collaborative platform. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member‚Äôs relative contribution to each project.\n\n\nActivities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on seven components: lecture, lab, homework, project, two exams, a final, and attendance and participation.\n\nLectures\nAttendance and participation will be tracked through in-class questions via Wooclap, which you can access on your laptop or phone. You will earn points for answering questions during lecture, and these points will contribute to your attendance and participation grade.\nThere are 26 lectures during the semester. You must participate in Wooclap questions in at least 18 lectures to get full credit on this component. Otherwise your grade on this component will be calculated as the percentage of lectures you attended and participated, e.g., if you attend and participate in 22/26 lectures, you get the full 5% but if you attend and participate in 15/26 lectures, you get (15/26)5% = 2.88%.\nApplication exercises won‚Äôt be graded directly, but we will track activity on them to ensure you‚Äôre staying engaged with the course and exams will feature topics and questions from these exercises.\n\n\nLabs\nIn the first few weeks of the semester, you will be randomly assigned to a team and work with your teammates on an exercise that is due at the end of the lab session. Once project teams are formed, you will work with that team on the lab exercises. You must be present in lab to complete the lab assignment. There is no way to make up for missing a lab.\nYou will submit your lab assignments by pushing your work to your GitHub repository for the lab and submitting the PDF output on Gradescope by the end of your lab session.\nThere are eight graded labs in the semester. The lowest two lab grades will be dropped at the end of the semester, which means you can miss up to two lab sessions with no penalty.\n\n\nHomework\nYou will complete homework assignments individually. You may start working on your homeowork assignment during your lab session, once you complete your lab exercise, but you will need to finish it outside of class. Your homework will be comprised of some practice exercises where you can get immediate feedback from AI tools designed for this course and some graded exercises.\nYou will submit your homework assignments by pushing your work to your GitHub repository for the homework and submitting the PDF output on Gradescope by 11:59pm on Sundays.\nThere are six graded homework assignments in the semester. The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester, which means you can miss one homework assignment with no penalty.\n\n\nExams\nThis course will have three exams: two exams and a final. The exams will include an in-class component (with a cheat sheet) and an open-note take-home component, while the final will include only an in-class component (with a cheat sheet).\nYou can demonstrate what you‚Äôve learned in the course thus far through these exams. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The exam‚Äôs content will be related to the content in videos and reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, and labs.\nYou will submit your take-home exam by pushing your work to your GitHub repository for the exam and submitting the PDF output on Gradescope by the stated deadline on the schedule.\n\n\nProject\nThe project aims to apply what you‚Äôve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed in teams, and each team will present their work during a lab session in the latter part of the semester. The write-up will be due on the same day.\nYou cannot pass this course if you have not completed the project.\nMore information about the project will be provided during the semester.",

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nDuke Community Standard\nAs a student in this course, you have agreed to uphold the Duke Community Standard and the practices specific to this course.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don‚Äôt cheat!\n\nWhat is allowed and what is not?\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nCollaboration: Only work that is clearly assigned as teamwork should be completed collaboratively. On individual assignments, you may not directly share work (including code) with another student in this class; on team assignments, you may not directly share work (including code) with another team. ‚ÄúSharing‚Äù includes, but is not limited to, messaging, emailing, or otherwise providing your work to another student or team.\n\nLabs: Collaboration in teams for lab assignments is not only allowed but expected. You will work together with your lab team to complete the lab exercise. However, each student must submit their own write-up of the lab exercise, which should reflect their understanding and ideas. It‚Äôs expected that lab submission will be similar across team members.\nProject: Similarly, collaboration within teams is not only allowed but expected for the project. The difference is that the project is a single, collaborative work developed by the entire team. It is the team‚Äôs responsibility to make sure all components of the project are vetted and revised by all team members, even if some division of labor takes place for first drafts of components. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed; however, you may not share code or project components across teams.\nHomework: You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write-up with other students. For homework assignments, sharing (or copying) of the code or write-up will be considered a violation for all students involved, regardless of who initiated the sharing.\nExams: You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams (in class and take home). On exams, collaboration, sharing (or copying) of the code, or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved, regardless of who initiated the sharing.\n\nUse of online resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course‚Äôs policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow), but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, resulting in an automatic 0 for the relevant portion of the assignment.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, like other online resources. Two guiding principles govern how to use AI in this course:\n\nCognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your thinking ability. We will practice using AI to facilitate‚Äîrather than hinder‚Äîlearning.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and ensure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n AI tools for code: You may use generative AI tools when you need help with assignments. However you should first attempt to solve the problem yourself. Your submission should not be a copy-paste of AI-generated content ‚Äì you must edit the content to ensure it reflects your understanding, has your voice and intellectual input, and conforms with course materials, syntax, terminology, and style. Additionally, the prompt you use cannot be copied and pasted directly from the assignment; you must create a prompt yourself.\n\nYou must also explicitly cite work submitted that is based on AI-generated content. You may use these guidelines to cite AI-generated content. The bare minimum citation must include the AI tool you‚Äôre using (e.g., ChatGPT), the model the tool uses, the date when you ran the prompt, and a link to the full transcript of the session starting with your prompt. A new citation must be included for each exercise where you used AI tools, with a new link to the full transceript of the interaction.\n\n AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use AI tools to generate a narrative that you then copy-paste verbatim into an assignment or edit and then insert into your assignment.\n AI tools for learning: You‚Äôre welcomed to ask AI tools questions that might help your learning and understanding in this course. However you should be critical of the answers you receive, as AI-generated content may not always be accurate or reliable. Use it to supplement your understanding, not as a substitute for learning.\n\nIn general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. Identifying AI-generated content is fairly straightforward. Any code identified as AI-generated but not cited as such and any narrative identified as AI-generated will be treated as plagiarism, resulting in an automatic 0 for the relevant portion of the assignment.\n\nIf you are unsure if using a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a teaching team member.\n\n\nWhat happens if you violate the academic honesty policy?\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course\n\nwill automatically result in a 0 for the relevant portion or the entire assignment or assessment,\ncan result in further deductions to your overall course grade (e.g., drop down to the next letter grade or drop down to an F), and\ncan be reported to the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards for further action.\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one‚Äôs own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for homework assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback in a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework assignment and lowest 2 lab assignments will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework assignments may be submitted up to 3 days late. A 5% deduction will be applied for each 24-hour period during which the assignment is late.\nNo late work is accepted for labs since these are designed to be completed in class.\nNo late work is accepted for exams.\nNo late work is accepted for projects.\n\n\n\nOne-time late penalty waiver\nIf circumstances prevent you from completing a homework by the stated due date, you may email the course coordinator, Dr.¬†Mary Knox, before the deadline to request to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide an explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it wisely. The waiver may only be used for homework assignments, not for attendance/participation, labs, exams, or the project.\nIf circumstances have a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your Quad advisor or academic dean know. They can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting them.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week after an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Regrade requests are also not a mechanism for asking for clarification on feedback, those questions should be brought to office hours. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire assignment may be regraded, which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final exam has been administered.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nEvery student is expected to attend and participate in lecture and labs and a portion of your grade depends on this. There may be times, however, when you cannot attend class. Lecture recordings are available upon request for students who have an excused absence. See the Lecture recording request policy for more detail. If you miss a lecture, make sure to review the material and complete the application exercise, if applicable, before the next lecture. Labs are dedicated to completing the lab assignment and collaborating with your lab team and there is no way to make up for missing a lab.\nMore details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\n\n\nLecture recording request\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week after the lecture date. To request a particular lecture‚Äôs video, please fill out the form at the link below. Please submit the form within 24 hours of missing lecture to ensure you have sufficient time to watch the recording. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as incapacitation forms, Dean‚Äôs excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.\nüîó https://forms.cloud.microsoft/r/jwFuhygVw5\nAbout one week before each exam, the class recordings will be available to all students. These recordings will be available until the start of the exam.",

    "text": "Computational toolkit\nYou may have heard/seen this phrase, Hello, World!, elsewhere before. It‚Äôs usually the first thing you learn in programming ‚Äì to learn to write a computer program to print this sentence to screen. Things will be different in this course, as it‚Äôs not a programming, but a data science course. So, starting tomorrow in class, you‚Äôll learn to use a computing language (called R) to work with data.\nBut today, we need to set you up for success! Let‚Äôs first briefly review the components of the computational toolkit for the course:\n\nR: The programming language you‚Äôll learn in this course.\n\nRStudio: The piece of software (a.k.a. the integrated development environment, IDE) you‚Äôll use to write R code in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.\n\n\n\n\nQuarto: The tool you‚Äôll use to create reproducible computational documents that contain both your narrative (i.e., words in English) and your code (i.e., code in R). Every piece of assignment you hand in will be a Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou might be familiar with word processors like MS Word or Google Docs. We will not be using these in this class. Instead, the words you would write in such a document as well as the code will go into a Quarto document, and when you render the document (more on what this means later) you will get a document out that has your words, your code, and the output of that code. Everything in one place, beautifully formatted!\n\n\n\nGit: Version control system.\n\nGitHub: A web hosting service for the Git version control system that also allows for transparent collaboration between team members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGit is a version control system (like ‚ÄúTrack Changes‚Äù features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better)."

You would need to pick a language (e.g.¬†English) and choose an interface to write your document with (such as Microsoft word with a .docx word doc). You also might want to use track changes to see edits you make and use a platform such as Google Drive to collaborate.\n\nWhile the computational toolkit is different than the one for a literature class, we can find many similarities between the tools, as is shown in the figure below."

Use succinct and informative commit messages. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 1\nGet to know the data.\n\n\nglimpse() at the country_inflation data frame and answer the following questions based on the output.\n\nHow many rows does country_inflation have and what does each row represent?\nHow many columns does country_inflation have and what does each column represent?\n\n\nDisplay the names of the countries included in the dataset. How many distinct countries are there?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFind distinct countries with distinct() and print all countries with print(n = ___) added to your pipeline, where the blank is the number of distinct countries.\n\n\nQuestion 2\nWhich countries had the top three highest inflation rates in 2023? Your output should be a data frame with two columns, country and 2023, with inflation rates in descending order, and three rows for the top three countries. Briefly comment on how the inflation rates for these countries compare to the inflation rate for United States in that year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nColumn names that are numbers are not considered ‚Äúproper‚Äù in R, therefore to select them you‚Äôll need to surround them with backticks (`).\n\n\nQuestion 3\nIn a single pipeline,\n\ncalculate the ratio of the inflation in 2023 and inflation in 1993 for each country and store this information in a new column called inf_ratio,\nselect the variables country and inf_ratio, and\nstore the result in a new data frame called country_inflation_ratios.\n\nThen, in two separate pipelines,\n\narrange country_inflation_ratios in increasing order of inf_ratio and\narrange country_inflation_ratios in decreasing order of inf_ratio.\n\nWhich country‚Äôs inflation increase is the largest over this time period and by how much? Which country‚Äôs inflation decrease is the largest over this time period and by how much?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor this question you‚Äôll once again need to use variables whose names are numbers (years) in your pipeline. Make sure to surround the names of such variables with backticks (`).\n\n\nQuestion 4\nReshape (pivot) country_inflation such that each row represents a country/year combination. Then, display the resulting data frame and state how many rows and columns it has and write a sentence stating the number of rows and columns as well as the names of the columns of the resulting data frame.\nRequirements:\n\nYour code must use one of pivot_longer() or pivot_wider(). There are other ways you can do this reshaping move in R, but this question requires solving this problem by pivoting.\nIn your pivot_*() function, you must use names_transform = as.numeric as an argument to transform the variable type to numeric as you pivot the data so that in the resulting data frame the year variable is numeric.\nThe resulting data frame must be saved as something other than country_inflation so you (1) can refer to this data frame later in your analysis and (2) do not overwrite country_inflation. Use a short but informative name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe last question in Part 1 as well as some questions in Part 2 require the use of the pivoted data frame from Question 4.\n\n\nQuestion 5\nUse a separate, single pipeline to answer each of the following questions.\nRequirement: Your code must use the filter() function for each part, not arrange().\n\nWhat is the highest inflation rate observed between 1993 and 2023? The output of the pipeline should be a data frame with one row and three columns. In addition to code and output, your response should include a single sentence stating the country and year.\nWhat is the lowest inflation rate observed between 1993 and 2023? The output of the pipeline should be a data frame with one row and three columns. In addition to code and output, your response should include a single sentence stating the country and year.\nPutting (a) and (b) together: What are the highest and the lowest inflation rates observed between 1993 and 2023? The output of the pipeline should be a data frame with two rows and three columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTOP: You must do this before proceeding to Part 2\n\n\n\nAt the end of your Part 1 Quarto file you‚Äôll see a code cell like the following:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nwrite_csv(_____, file = \"data/country-inflation-pivoted.csv\")\n```\n\nThis will allow you to save the pivoted data frame from Question 4 as a CSV (comma-separated-values) file called country-inflation-pivoted.csv in your data folder so that you can read it and use it Part 2.\nYou need to modify the code cell by doing the following two things:\n\n\nfill in the blank with the name of the pivoted data frame from Question 4 and\n\nchange the value of the code cell option* eval from false to true so that the code cell will run and save the CSV file when you render your Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message. And once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files including the newly created dataset so that your Git pane is empty afterward. We keep repeating this because it‚Äôs important and because we see students forget to do this. So take a moment to make sure you‚Äôre practicing good version control habits."

However, you‚Äôll need to set eval to true in the code cell options so that this code runs when you render your Quarto document.

    "text": "Questions 7-9\nInflation in the US.\nThe OECD defines inflation as follows:\n\nInflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption in an economy over a period of time.\nThe main measure of inflation is the annual inflation rate which is the movement of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from one month/period to the same month/period of the previous year expressed as percentage over time.\nSource: OECD CPI FAQ\n\nCPI is broken down into 12 expenditures such as food, housing, health, etc. Your goal in this part is to create another time series plot of annual inflation, this time for US only.\nThe data you will need to create this visualization is spread across two files:\n\n\nus-inflation.csv: Annual inflation rate for the US for 12 CPI expenditures. Each expenditure is identified by an ID number.\n\ncpi-expenditures.csv: A ‚Äúlookup table‚Äù of CPI expenditure ID numbers and their descriptions.\n\nLet‚Äôs load both of these files.\n\nus_inflation &lt;- read_csv(\"data/us-inflation.csv\")\ncpi_expenditures &lt;- read_csv(\"data/cpi-expenditures.csv\")\n\nQuestion 7\na. How many columns and how many rows does the us_inflation dataset have? What are the variables in it? Which years do these data span? Write a brief (1-2 sentences) narrative summarizing this information.\nb. How many columns and how many rows does the cpi_expenditures dataset have? What are the variables in it? Write a brief (1-2 sentences) narrative summarizing this information.\nc. Create a new dataset by joining the us_inflation dataset with the cpi_expenditure_id dataset.\n\nDetermine which type of join is the most appropriate one and use that.\nNote that the two datasets don‚Äôt have a variable with a common name, though they do have variables that contain common information but are named differently. You will need to first figure out which variables those are, and then define the by argument and use the join_by() function to indicate these variables to join the datasets by.\nUse a short but informative name for the joined dataset, and do not overwrite either of the datasets that go into creating it.\n\nThen, find the number of rows and columns of the resulting dataset and report the names of its columns. Add a brief (1-2 sentences) narrative summarizing this information.\nQuestion 8\na. Create a vector called expenditures_of_interest which contains the descriptions or IDs of CPI expenditures you want to visualize. Your expenditures_of_interest should consist of no more than five expenditures. If you‚Äôre using descriptions, make sure that the spelling of your expenditures matches how they appear in the dataset. Then, in 1-2 sentences, state why you chose these expenditures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRefer back to the guidance provided in Question 6 if you‚Äôre not sure how to create this vector.\n\n\nb. In a single pipeline, filter your joined dataset to include only the expenditures_of_interest from part (a), and save the resulting data frame with a new name so you (1) can refer to this data frame later in your analysis and (2) do not overwrite the data frame you‚Äôre starting with. Use a short but informative name. Then, in a new pipeline, find the distinct() expenditures in the data frame you created.\nQuestion 9\nUsing your data frame from the previous question, create a plot of annual inflation vs.¬†year for these expenditures. Then, in a few sentences, describe the patterns you observe in the plot, particularly focusing on anything you find surprising or not surprising, based on your knowledge (or lack thereof) of inflation rates in the US over the last decade.\nRequirements for the plot:\n\nData should be represented with points as well as lines connecting the points for each expenditure.\nEach expenditure should be represented by a different color line and different color and shape points.\nAxes and legend should be properly labeled.\nThe plot should have an appropriate title (and optionally a subtitle).\nPlot should be customized in at least one way ‚Äì you could use a different than default color scale, or different than default theme, or some other customization.\nIf your legend has labels that are too long, you can try moving the legend to the bottom and stack the labels vertically. Hint: The legend.position and legend.direction arguments of the theme() functions will be useful.\n\n\nggplot(...) +\n  ... +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.direction = \"vertical\"\n  )"

    "text": "Question 10\nHandling missing values after joins.\nIn class last week, we worked with the sales_taxes dataset and joined it to another dataset called us_regions so that we ended up with a data frame containing information on each state (plus DC), salex tax rate in that state, and the region the state is in. While DC was in our first dataset, it was not in the second, resulting in an NA value for the region variable in the joined dataset. We discussed that there are three approaches we could take to address this issue before calculating the average average sales tax of states in each region.\na. Read in the two datasets, sales-taxes-25.csv and us-regions.csv, which are both in your data folder. Then, join the two datasets using the appropriate type of join to be able to calculate the average sales tax rate by region, not overwriting either data frame that goes into the join.\nb. Apply the three approaches we discussed in class to address the issue that DC has an NA value for region in the joined dataset, and then calculate the average average sales tax of states in each region.\nc. Choose one of the three approaches as the ‚Äúmost appropriate‚Äù approach and provide a brief (1-2 sentences) rationale for your choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can refer back to AE 06: Sales taxes + data joining if you need a reminder of these data and how to join them."

For example, you can create the first plot with:\n\nggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Population density\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    title = \"Population density of Midwestern counties\",\n    subtitle = \"Binwidth = 100\"\n  )\n\nYou will need to make four different histograms. Make sure to set informative titles and axis labels for each of your plots. Then, comment on which binwidth is most appropriate for these data and why.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 1‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 2\nVisualize the distribution of population density of counties again, this time using a boxplot with geom_boxplot(). Make sure to set informative titles and axis labels for your plot. Then, using information as needed from the box plot as well as the histogram from Question 1, describe the distribution of population density of counties and comment on any potential outliers, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative and commenting on whether it makes sense to you that this county is an outlier. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn describing a distribution, make sure to mention shape, center, spread, and any unusual observations.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 2‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 3\nCreate a scatterplot of the percentage below poverty (percbelowpoverty on the y-axis) versus percentage of people with a college degree (percollege on the x-axis), where the color and shape of points are determined by state. Make sure to set informative titles, axis, and legend labels for your plot. First, describe the overall relationship between percentage of people with a college degree and percentage below poverty in Midwestern states, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them.

Identify the name of this county. You can use the data viewer to identify it interactively, you do not have to write code.\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.\nOnce again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n\nQuestion 5\nDo some states have a higher percentage of their counties located in a metropolitan area?\nCreate a segmented bar plot with one bar per state and the bar filled with colors according to the value of metro ‚Äì one color indicating Yes and the other color indicating No for whether a county is considered to be a metro area. The y-axis of the segmented barplot should range from 0 to 1, indicating proportions. Compare the percentage of counties in metro areas across the states based on this plot. Make sure to supplement your narrative with rough estimates of these percentages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nFor this question, you should begin with the data wrangling pipeline below. We will learn more about data wrangling in the coming weeks, so this is a mini-preview. This pipeline creates a new variable called metro based on the value of the existing variable called inmetro. If the value of inmetro is equal to 1 (inmetro == 1), it sets the value of metro to \"Yes\", and if not, it sets the value of metro to \"No\". The resulting data frame is assigned back to midwest, overwriting the existing midwest data frame with a version that includes the new metro variable.\n\nmidwest &lt;- midwest |&gt;\n  mutate(metro = if_else(inmetro == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\n\n\n\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.\nAnd once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward. We keep repeating this because it‚Äôs important and because we see students forget to do this. So take a moment to make sure you‚Äôre following along with the version control instructions."

Then, highlight one feature of home ownership that this plot reveals in 1-2 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\nx-axis: You can modify the x-axis labels to be percentages in a scale_x_continuous() layer. The scales package offers a handy function for formatting percentages, label_percent(). You can use this in the labels argument of scale_x_continuous().\nColor palette: The scale_color_colorblind() and scale_fill_colorblind() functions from the ggthemes package provide a color palette that is friendly for individuals with color vision deficiencies.\nTransparancy: You should adjust the transparency of the filled density curves. You don‚Äôt have to worry about the exact transparency value, but you should try a few to get close.\nTheme: This plot uses a non-default theme. See theme options documentation for options.\nLegend: You should move the legend to the top of the plot. You can do this in a theme() layer. See theme documentation to identify the argument you need to change to move the legend.\nAspect ratio: You can adjust the aspect ratio by setting the fig-asp option in the code cell. A smaller (closer to 0) value makes the plot shorter and wider, while a larger (closer to 1) value makes the plot square-ish.\nWidth: You can also adjust the width of the plot by setting the fig-width option in the code cell. A larger value makes the plot wider.\n\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.
