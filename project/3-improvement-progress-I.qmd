You must attend this lab in person and participate in the teamwork in person to be eligible for the points for this milestone.
Team members who are not in lab in person for this milestone will not be eligible for these points, regardless of their contribution throughout the rest of the project.

By this point you've received feedback on your proposal and you should be working on incorporating that feedback to improve your project and making further progress on it.
This milestone ensures you're keeping on task and doing these things.

# Goals

The goals of this milestone are as follows:

-   Incorporate feedback from your proposal
-   Make progress on your project prior to the peer review

# Instructions

Make some progress, evidenced by commits to your repo since project milestone 2. 
These commits should

-   explicitly closing issues opened as proposal feedback, and
-   make further progress on the project.

# Grading
