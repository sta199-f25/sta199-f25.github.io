Read it in with `read_csv()`.\n\nb.  Transform the `is_canceled` variable to be a factor with \"not canceled\" (0) as the first level and \"canceled\" (1) as the second level.\n\n## Question 2\n\nUsing these data, one of our goals is to explore the following question:\n\n> *Are reservations earlier in the month or later in the month more likely to be cancelled?*\n\na.  **In a single pipeline**, calculate the mean arrival dates (`arrival_date_day_of_month`) for reservations that were cancelled and reservations that were not cancelled.\n\nb.  In your own words, explain why we can not use a linear model to model the relationship between if a hotel reservation was cancelled and the day of month for the booking.\n\nc.  Fit the appropriate model to predict whether a reservation was cancelled from `arrival_date_day_of_month` and display a tidy summary of the model output.\n    Then, interpret the slope coefficient in context of the data and the research question.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Hint\n\nThe slope interpretation will have the following format:\n\n> The model predicts that, for each day the booking is \\_\\_\\_ (later / earlier) in the month, the \\_\\_\\_ (chance / probability / odds) of a hotel cancellation is \\_\\_\\_ (lower / higher) by a factor of \\_\\_\\_, on average.\n:::\n\nd.  Calculate the probability that the hotel reservation is cancelled if it the arrival date date is on the 26th of the month.\n    Based on this probability, would you predict this booking would be cancelled or not cancelled.\n    Explain your reasoning for your classification.\n\n## Question 3\n\na.  Fit another model to predict whether a reservation was cancelled from `arrival_date_day_of_month` and `hotel` type (Resort or City Hotel), allowing the relationship between `arrival_date_day_of_month` and `is_canceled` to vary based on `hotel` type.\n    Display a tidy output of the model.\n\nb.  Interpret the intercept in context of the data.\n\n# Wrap-up\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure that you render, commit, and push one final time so that the final versions of both your `.qmd` file and the rendered PDF are pushed to GitHub and your Git pane is empty.\nWe will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.\n:::\n\n## Submission\n\nBy now you should also be familiar with how to submit your assignment in Gradescope.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click to expand if you need a refresher on how to get started with a lab assignment.</summary>\n\nSubmit your PDF document to Gradescope by the end of the lab to be considered \"on time\":\n\n-   Go to <http://www.gradescope.com> and click *Log in* in the top right corner.\n-   Click *School Credentials* $\\rightarrow$ *Duke NetID* and log in using your NetID credentials.\n-   Click on your *STA 199* course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark all the pages associated with question. All the pages of your lab should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be \"checked\").\n\n::: callout-important\n## Checklist\n\nMake sure you have:\n\n-   attempted all questions\n-   rendered your Quarto document\n-   committed and pushed everything to your GitHub repository such that the Git pane in RStudio is empty\n-   uploaded your PDF to Gradescope\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\n## Grading and feedback\n\n-   This lab is worth 30 points:\n    -   10 points for being in lab and turning in *something* -- no partial credit for this part.\n    -   20 points for:\n        -   answering the questions correctly -- there is partial credit for this part.\n        -   following the workflow -- there is partial credit for this part.\n-   The workflow points are for:\n    -   committing at least three times as you work through your lab,\n    -   having your final version of `.qmd` and `.pdf` files in your GitHub repository, and\n    -   overall organization.\n-   You'll receive feedback on your lab on Gradescope within a week.\n\nGood luck, and have fun with it!\n",
