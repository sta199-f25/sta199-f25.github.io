Wildly different? Somewhere in between?\n\n## Question 3 - Model and estimate\n\nFit a model predicting `air_time` using `distance` using the sample data.\nDisplay the model summary.\n\nHow does the slope estimate in your sample compare to that of others in your team or others in the class?\nExactly the same? Wildly different? Somewhere in between?\n\n## Question 4 - Quantify(ish) uncertainty\n\nMark your slope estimate from Question 3 on the number line on the board.\nThen, based on the slope estimates from the entire class, determine a reasonable range of values for the estimate of the slope of the relationship between `distance` and `air_time`.\nHow do you define \"reasonable\"?\n\n# Wrap-up\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure that you render, commit, and push one final time so that the final versions of both your `.qmd` file and the rendered PDF are pushed to GitHub and your Git pane is empty.\nWe will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.\n:::\n\n## Submission\n\nBy now you should also be familiar with how to submit your assignment in Gradescope.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click to expand if you need a refresher on how to get started with a lab assignment.</summary>\n\nSubmit your PDF document to Gradescope by the end of the lab to be considered \"on time\":\n\n-   Go to <http://www.gradescope.com> and click *Log in* in the top right corner.\n-   Click *School Credentials* $\\rightarrow$ *Duke NetID* and log in using your NetID credentials.\n-   Click on your *STA 199* course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark all the pages associated with question. All the pages of your lab should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be \"checked\").\n\n::: callout-important\n## Checklist\n\nMake sure you have:\n\n-   attempted all questions\n-   rendered your Quarto document\n-   committed and pushed everything to your GitHub repository such that the Git pane in RStudio is empty\n-   uploaded your PDF to Gradescope\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\n## Grading and feedback\n\n-   This lab is worth 30 points:\n    -   10 points for being in lab and turning in *something* -- no partial credit for this part.\n    -   20 points for:\n        -   answering the questions correctly -- there is partial credit for this part.\n        -   following the workflow -- there is partial credit for this part.\n-   The workflow points are for:\n    -   committing at least three times as you work through your lab,\n    -   having your final version of `.qmd` and `.pdf` files in your GitHub repository, and\n    -   overall organization.\n-   You'll receive feedback on your lab on Gradescope within a week.\n\nGood luck, and have fun with it!\n",
