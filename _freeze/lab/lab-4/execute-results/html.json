You should now see the RStudio environment.\n-   Go to the course organization at [github.com/sta199-f25](https://github.com/sta199-f25) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-4**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the homework.\n-   Click on the green **CODE** button, select **Use SSH**. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\n-   In RStudio, go to *File* ➛ *New Project* ➛*Version Control* ➛ *Git*.\n-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. Again, please make sure to have *SSH* highlighted under *Clone* when you copy the address.\n-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.\n\n</details>\n\nOpen the *lab-4.qmd* template Quarto file and update the `authors` field to add your name first (first and last) and then your teammates' names (first and last).\nRender the document.\nExamine the rendered document and make sure your and your teammates' names are updated in the document.\nCommit and push your changes with a meaningful commit message and push to GitHub.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click to expand if you need a refresher on assignment guidelines.</summary>\n\n### Code\n\nCode should follow the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/).\nParticularly,\n\n-   there should be spaces before and line breaks after each `+` when building a `ggplot`,\n-   there should also be spaces before and line breaks after each `|>` in a data transformation pipeline,\n-   code should be properly indented,\n-   there should be spaces around `=` signs and spaces after commas.\n\nAdditionally, all code should be visible in the PDF output, i.e., should not run off the page on the PDF.\nLong lines that run off the page should be split across multiple lines with line breaks.[^1]\n\n[^1]: Remember, haikus not novellas when writing code!\n\n### Plots\n\n-   Plots should have an informative title and, if needed, also a subtitle.\n-   Axes and legends should be labeled with both the variable name and its units (if applicable).\n-   Careful consideration should be given to aesthetic choices.\n\n### Workflow\n\nContinuing to develop a sound workflow for reproducible data analysis is important as you complete the lab and other assignments in this course.\n\n-   You should have at least 3 commits with meaningful commit messages by the end of the assignment.\n-   Final versions of both your `.qmd` file and the rendered PDF should be pushed to GitHub.\n\n\n</details>\n\n## Packages\n\nIn this lab we will work with the **tidyverse** package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data\n\nYouGov, in collaboration with Elon University Poll and the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, polled 1,500 US adults (aged 18 and older) between July 7-11, 2025.[^2]\nThe following question was asked to these 1,500 adults:\n\n[^2]: Full survey results can be found at <https://eloncdn.blob.core.windows.net/eu3/sites/819/2025/07/Elon-Knight-Commission-survey-TOPLINE.pdf>.\n\n> Overall, how would you describe the impact of the many changes (transfer portal, athlete name, image and likeness (NIL) compensation, conference\nrealignments[^3]) taking place in Division I college athletics?\n\n[^3]: The transfer portal is an online database for college student-athletes who wish to transfer to a different school. Name, image, and likeness (NIL) compensation allows college athletes to earn money from third-party companies for using their \"name, image, and likeness\" through activities like endorsements, social media promotions, and public appearances. Conference realignments refer to the shifting of colleges and universities between athletic conferences, which can affect competition levels, revenue distribution, and media exposure.\n\nResponses were broken down into the following categories:\n\n| Variable | Levels                                          |\n|:---------|:------------------------------------------------|\n| Age      | 18-44; 45+                                      |\n| Opinion  | Very positive; Somewhat positive; Neutral; Somewhat negative; Very negative; Unsure |\n\nOf the 1,500 responses, 699 were between the ages of 18-44.\n\nOf the individuals that are between 18-44,\n\n- 78  individuals said they thought the changes were Very positive,\n- 176 individuals said they thought the changes were Somewhat positive,\n- 162 individuals said they thought the changes were Neutral,\n- 50  individuals said they thought the changes were Somewhat negative,\n- 36  individuals said they thought the changes were Very negative.\n\nOf the individuals that are 45+,\n\n- 41  individuals said they thought the changes were Very positive,\n- 121 individuals said they thought the changes were Somewhat positive,\n- 186 individuals said they thought the changes were Neutral,\n- 146 individuals said they thought the changes were Somewhat negative,\n- 97  individuals said they thought the changes were Very negative.\n\n# Questions\n\n## Question 1\n\na.  Fill in the code below to create a two-way table that summarizes these data by filling in the blanks below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# fmt: skip\nsurvey_counts <- tribble(\n  ~age,    ~opinion,            ~n,\n  \"18-44\", \"Very positive\",     ___,\n  \"18-44\", \"Somewhat positive\", ___,\n  \"18-44\", \"Neutral\",           ___,\n  \"18-44\", \"Somewhat negative\", ___,\n  \"18-44\", \"Very negative\",     ___,\n  \"18-44\", \"Unsure\",            ___,\n  \"45+\",   \"Very positive\",     ___,\n  \"45+\",   \"Somewhat positive\", ___,\n  \"45+\",   \"Neutral\",           ___,\n  \"45+\",   \"Somewhat negative\", ___,\n  \"45+\",   \"Very negative\",     ___,\n  \"45+\",   \"Unsure\",            ___\n) |>\n  mutate(\n    age     = fct_relevel(age, ___),\n    opinion = fct_relevel(opinion, ___)\n  )\n\nsurvey_counts |>\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = ___,\n    values_from = ___\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor parts b-d below, use a single pipeline starting with `survey_counts`, calculate the desired proportions, and make sure the result is an **ungrouped** data frame with a column for relevant counts, a column for relevant proportions, and a column for the groups you're interested in.\n\nb.  Marginal proportions of age: Calculate the proportions of individuals who are 18-44 year olds and 45+ year-olds in this sample.\n\nc.  Marginal proportions of opinion: Calculate the proportions of individuals who are Very positive, Somewhat positive, Neutral, Somewhat negative, Very negative, and Unsure.\n\nd.  Conditional proportions of opinion based on age: Calculate the proportions of individuals who are Very positive, Somewhat positive, Neutral, Somewhat negative, Very negative, and Unsure\n\n    -   among those who are 18-44 years old and\n    -   among those who are 45+ years old.\n\n## Question 2\n\na.  What type of plot would be appropriate to visualize the relationship between age and opinion on the impact of the many changes taking place in Division I college athletics?\n\nb.  Create the plot, using `geom_col()`, from part (a) that can be used to evaluate the relationship between age and `opinion` on the impact of the many changes taking place in Division I college athletics? Use the discrete viridis color scale for the fill aesthetic, `scale_fill_viridis_d()`. You cal review the documentation for this function and choose a Viridis color scale other than the default, but you must use one of these since the data are ordinal and an ordinal color scale is most appropriate. Make sure to include appropriate labels and a title (and also a subtitle if you wish).\n\n::: callout-tip\nYour visualization should be displaying the proportions you calculated in Question 1(d).\n:::\n\nc.  Based on your calculations so far, as well as your visualization, write 1-2 sentences that describe the relationship, in this sample, between age and opinion on the impact of the many changes taking place in Division I college athletics?\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push one last time.\nMake sure that you commit and push all changed documents and that your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.\n:::\n\n# Wrap-up\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure that you render, commit, and push one final time so that the final versions of both your `.qmd` file and the rendered PDF are pushed to GitHub and your Git pane is empty.\nWe will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.\n:::\n\n## Submission\n\nBy now you should also be familiar with how to submit your assignment in Gradescope.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click to expand if you need a refresher on how to get started with a lab assignment.</summary>\n\nSubmit your PDF document to Gradescope by the end of the lab to be considered \"on time\":\n\n-   Go to <http://www.gradescope.com> and click *Log in* in the top right corner.\n-   Click *School Credentials* $\\rightarrow$ *Duke NetID* and log in using your NetID credentials.\n-   Click on your *STA 199* course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark all the pages associated with question. All the pages of your lab should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be \"checked\").\n\n::: callout-important\n## Checklist\n\nMake sure you have:\n\n-   attempted all questions\n-   rendered your Quarto document\n-   committed and pushed everything to your GitHub repository such that the Git pane in RStudio is empty\n-   uploaded your PDF to Gradescope\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\n## Grading and feedback\n\n-   This lab is worth 30 points:\n    -   10 points for being in lab and turning in *something* -- no partial credit for this part.\n    -   20 points for:\n        -   answering the questions correctly -- there is partial credit for this part.\n        -   following the workflow -- there is partial credit for this part.\n-   The workflow points are for:\n    -   committing at least three times as you work through your lab,\n    -   having your final version of `.qmd` and `.pdf` files in your GitHub repository, and\n    -   overall organization.\n-   You'll receive feedback on your lab on Gradescope within a week.\n\nGood luck, and have fun with it!\n",
