These values appear to indicate how the characters in each film identify. Some of these values do not match how the actor identifies.\n\nThe data are in an Excel file called `age-gaps.xlsx` in your `data` folder.\n\nThis is how the Excel file looks -- it has two sheets, one with the data (called `Hollywood Age Gaps`) and one with information about the data (called `Source`). Additionally, the data sheet has some metadata at the top, above the column headers.\n\n![](images/age-gaps-source.png){width=\"400\"}\n![](images/age-gaps-data.png){width=\"400\"}\n\n## Import\n\nLoad the data from `age-gaps.xlsx` in your `data` and assign it to `age_gaps`.\nConfirm that this new object appears in your Environment tab.\nClick on the *name of the object* in your Environment tab to pop open the data in the data viewer.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Subset\n\nCreate a subset of the data frame for heterosexual relationships on screen.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nSplit the data for heterosexual relationships into three -- where woman is older, where man is older, where they are the same age.\nSave these subsets as two appropriately named data frames.\n*Remember:* Use concise and evocative names.\nConfirm that these new objects appear in your Environment tab and that the sum of the number of observations in the two new data frames add to the number of observations in the original data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Export\n\nWrite out the three new datasets you created into the `data`, and within that, into a subfolder called `age-gaps-subsets`, as CSV files.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwrite_csv(woman_older, file = \"data/age-gaps-subsets/woman-older.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in write_csv(woman_older, file = \"data/age-gaps-subsets/woman-older.csv\"): could not find function \"write_csv\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add more code here\n```\n:::\n\n",
