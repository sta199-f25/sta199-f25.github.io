The mission of the [Long Term Ecological Research program (LTER)](https://lternet.edu) Network is to \"provide the scientific community, policy makers, and society with the knowledge and predictive understanding necessary to conserve, protect, and manage the nation’s ecosystems, their biodiversity, and the services they provide.\"\n\nSpecifically we'll be using data from the North Temperate Lakes LTER (NTL-LTER) site, which is located in the Madison, WI area, modeling the relationship between number of days that a lake is frozen, excluding periods where the lake thaws before refreezing again, and annual average temperature.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Packages\n\nWe will use the **tidyverse** package for data visualization and wrangling and the **tidymodels** package for modeling.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Data\n\nThe data can be found in the `data` folder; it's called `icecover.csv`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe data dictionary is below:\n\n| Variable Name      | Description                                                      |\n|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `lakeid`           | Lake name                                                        |\n| `ice_on`           | Date of freeze of lake                                           |\n| `ice_off`          | Date of ice breakup of lake                                      |\n| `ice_duration`     | Number of days between the freeze and breakup dates of each lake |\n| `year`             | Year of observation                                              |\n| `annual_avg_temp`  | Annual average air temperature (°C)                              |\n\n## Visualizing the model\n\nWe’re going to investigate the relationship between `ice_duration` and `annual_avg_temp`.\n\n- Create an appropriate plot to investigate this relationship. Add appropriate labels to the plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n- If you were to draw a a straight line to best represent the relationship between ice duration and annual average temperature, where would it go? Why?\n\n*Start from the top left and go towards bottom right. Identify the first and last point and draw a line through most the others.*\n\n- Now, let R draw the line for you. Refer to the documentation at <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html>. Specifically, refer to the method section.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n- What types of questions can this plot help answer?\n\nAdd response here.\n\n- We can use this line to make predictions. Predict what you think the ice duration would be in a year with annual average temperature of 7, 10, and 12 °C. Which prediction is considered extrapolation?\n\nAdd response here.\n\n- What is a residual?\n\nAdd response here.\n\n## Model fitting\n\nFit a model to predict ice cover from average annual temperature.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Model summary\n\n- Display the model summary including estimates for the slope and intercept along with measurements of uncertainty around them. Show how you can extract these values from the model output.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n- Write out your model using mathematical notation.\n\n$$ \\widehat{ice~duration} = 148 - 6.18 \\times annual~avg~temp $$\n\n## Correlation\n\nWe can also assess correlation between two quantitative variables.\n\n- What is correlation? What are values correlation can take?\n\nAdd response here.\n\n- What is the correlation between heights and weights of fish?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Fitting other models\n\nWe can fit more models than just a straight line. Change the plotting code from earlier to use `method = \"loess\"`. What is different from the plot created before?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n",
