Write the estimated model output below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nAdd response here.\n\n-   Interpret the slope and the intercept in the context of the data.\n\nAdd response here.\n\n-   Recreate the visualization from above, this time adding a regression line to the visualization `geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   What is the estimated body mass for a penguin with a flipper length of 210?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   What is the estimated body mass for a penguin with a flipper length of 100?\n\nAdd response here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Another model\n\n-   A different researcher wants to look at body weight of penguins based on the island they were recorded on. How are the variables involved in this analysis different?\n\nAdd response here.\n\n-   Make an appropriate visualization to investigate this relationship below. Additionally, calculate the mean body mass by island.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Change the geom of your previous plot to `geom_point()`. Use this plot to think about how R models these data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Fit the linear regression model and display the results. Write the estimated model output below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Interpret each coefficient in context of the problem.\n\nAdd response here.\n\n-   What is the estimated body weight of a penguin on Biscoe island?\n    What are the estimated body weights of penguins on Dream and Torgersen islands?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n",
