Create the following plot, which will serve as the \"first draft\" on the way to our [Goal]. Do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.\n\n![](/slides/images/07/stats-intermediate-plot.png){fig-alt=\"Line plot of numbers of Statistical Science majors over the years (2011 - 2025).

Do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add your code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Demo:** Update line colors using the following level / color assignments. Once again, do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.\n    -   \"BS\" = \"cadetblue4\"\n\n    -   \"BS2\" = \"cadetblue3\"\n\n    -   \"AB\" = \"lightgoldenrod4\"\n\n    -   \"AB2\" = \"lightgoldenrod3\"\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add your code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Your turn:** Update the plot labels (`title`, `subtitle`, `x`, `y`, and `caption`) and use `theme_minimal()`. Once again, do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add your code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Demo:** Finally, adding to your pipeline you've developed so far, move the legend into the plot, make its background white, and its border gray. Set `fig-width: 7` and `fig-height: 5` for your plot in the chunk options.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add your code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Let's now pivot wider!\n\n-   **Demo:** Just like you can pivot longer, you can pivot wider. Let's convert our longer data frame back into the  wider one in a single pipeline.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add your code here\n```\n:::\n\n",
