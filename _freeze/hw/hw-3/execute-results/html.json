Complete in `hw-3-part-1.qmd`, no submission required.\n\n- **Part 2 -- üßëüèΩ‚Äçüè´ Feedback from Humans:** Graded, you get feedback from the course instructional team within a week. Complete in `hw-3-part-2.qmd`, submit on Gradescope.\n\nBy now you should be familiar with how to get started with a homework assignment by cloning the GitHub repo for the assignment.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand if you need a refresher on how to get started with a homework assignment.</summary>\n\n-   Go to <https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers> and login with your Duke NetID and Password.\n-   Click `STA199` under My reservations to log into your container. You should now see the RStudio environment.\n-   Go to the course organization at [github.com/sta199-f25](https://github.com/sta199-f25) organization on GitHub.\n    Click on the repo with the prefix **hw-3**.\n    It contains the starter documents you need to complete the homework.\n-   Click on the green **CODE** button, select **Use SSH**.\n    Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\n-   In RStudio, go to *File* ‚ûõ *New Project* ‚ûõ*Version Control* ‚ûõ *Git*.\n-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. Again, please make sure to have *SSH* highlighted under *Clone* when you copy the address.\n-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.\n</details>\n\nBy now you should also be familiar with guidelines for formatting your code and plots as well as your Git and Gradescope workflow.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand if you need a refresher on assignment guidelines.</summary>\n### Code\n\nCode should follow the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/).\nParticularly,\n\n-   there should be spaces before and line breaks after each `+` when building a `ggplot`,\n-   there should also be spaces before and line breaks after each `|>` in a data transformation pipeline,\n-   code should be properly indented,\n-   there should be spaces around `=` signs and spaces after commas.\n\nAdditionally, all code should be visible in the PDF output, i.e., should not run off the page on the PDF.\nLong lines that run off the page should be split across multiple lines with line breaks.\n\n### Plots\n\n-   Plots should have an informative title and, if needed, also a subtitle.\n-   Axes and legends should be labeled with both the variable name and its units (if applicable).\n-   Careful consideration should be given to aesthetic choices.\n\n### Workflow\n\nContinuing to develop a sound workflow for reproducible data analysis is important as you complete the lab and other assignments in this course.\n\n-   You should have at least 3 commits with meaningful commit messages by the end of the assignment.\n-   Final versions of both your `.qmd` file and the rendered PDF should be pushed to GitHub.\n\n</details>\n\n\n# Part 1 -- Feedback from AI\n\nYour answers to the questions in this part should go in the file `hw-3-part-1.qmd`.\n\n## Instructions\n\nWrite your answer to each question in the appropriate section of the `hw-3-part-1.qmd` file.\nThen, highlight your answer to a question, click on _Addins > AIFEEDR > Get feedback_.\nIn the app that opens, select the appropriate homework number (2) and question number.\nThen click on _Get Feedback_.\nPlease be patient, feedback generation can take a few seconds. \nOnce you read the feedback, you can go back to your Quarto document to improve your answer based on the feedback. \nYou will then need to click the red X on the top left corner of the Viewer pane to stop the feedback app from running before you can re-render your Quarto document.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand if you want to review the video that demonstrates how to use the AI feedback tool.</summary>\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/EyT6QQN1ouQ?si=DsG-laE30BykMJby title=\"aifeedr\">}}\n</details>\n\n## Packages\n\nIn this part you will work with the **tidyverse** package, which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a \"tidy\" way.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncountry_inflation <- read_csv(\"data/country-inflation.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Questions\n\n::: render-commit-push\nDo not forget to render, commit, and push regularly, after each substantial change to your document (e.g., after answering each question).\nUse succinct and informative commit messages.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n### Question 1\n\nGet to know the data.\n\na.  [`glimpse()`](https://pillar.r-lib.org/reference/glimpse.html) at the `country_inflation` data frame and answer the following questions based on the output. How many rows does `country_inflation` have and what does each row represent? How many columns does `country_inflation` have and what does each column represent?\n\nb.  Display a list of the unique countries included in the dataset. How many countries are there? *Hint:* Another word for ‚Äúunique‚Äù is [`distinct()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/distinct.html).\n\n\n### Question 2\n\n\n\n### Question 3\n\n\n\n### Question 4\n\n\n\n### Question 5\n\n\n::: render-commit-push\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.\nAnd once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\nWe keep repeating this because it's important and because we see students forget to do this.\nSo take a moment to make sure you're practicing good version control habits.\n:::\n\n# Part 2 -- Feedback from Humans\n\nYour answers to the questions in this part should go in the file `hw-3-part-2.qmd`.\n\n## Packages\n\nYou will use the **tidyverse** package for data wrangling and visualization, \n\nTO DO: Add any other packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Questions 6\n\nIn class we worked with the `sales_taxes` dataset and joined it to regions. DC was NA. We discussed three things we can do. Do each of them...\n\nTO DO: Clean up and add more details.\n\n## Questions 7-9\n\n### Data\n\nTO DO: Add \n\n### Question 7\n\n### Question 8\n\n### Question 9\n\n::: render-commit-push\nIf you haven't done so recently, you should render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and succinct commit message.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n## Question 10\n\n\n\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n# Wrap-up\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure that you render, commit, and push one final time so that the final versions of both your `.qmd` file and the rendered PDF are pushed to GitHub and your Git pane is empty.\nWe will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.\n:::\n\n## Submission\n\nSubmit your PDF document to Gradescope by the deadline to be considered \"on time\":\n\n-   Go to <http://www.gradescope.com> and click *Log in* in the top right corner.\n-   Click *School Credentials* $\\rightarrow$ *Duke NetID* and log in using your NetID credentials.\n-   Click on your *STA 199* course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark all the pages associated with question. All the pages of your homework should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be \"checked\").\n\n::: callout-important\n## Checklist\n\nMake sure you have:\n\n-   attempted all questions\n-   rendered your Quarto document\n-   committed and pushed everything to your GitHub repository such that the Git pane in RStudio is empty\n-   uploaded your PDF to Gradescope\n:::\n\n\n## Grading and feedback\n\n-   Questions 1-5 are not graded, but you should complete them to get practice.\n\n-   Questions 6-10 are graded, and you will receive feedback on Gradescope from the course instructional team within a week.\n    -   Questions will be graded for accuracy and completeness.\n    -   Partial credit will be given where appropriate.\n    -   There are also workflow points for:\n        - committing at least three times as you work through your lab,\n        - having your final version of `.qmd` and `.pdf` files in your GitHub repository, and\n        - overall organization.\n",
