Complete in `hw-1-part-1.qmd`, no submission required.\n\n- **Part 2 -- üßëüèΩ‚Äçüè´ Feedback from Humans:** Graded, you get feedback from the course instructional team within a week. Complete in `hw-1-part-2.qmd`, submit on Gradescope.\n\nTo get started, follow the instructions below.\n\n-   Go to <https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers> and login with your Duke NetID and Password.\n-   Click `STA199` under My reservations to log into your container. You should now see the RStudio environment.\n-   Go to the course organization at [github.com/sta199-f25](https://github.com/sta199-f25) organization on GitHub.\n    Click on the repo with the prefix **hw-1**.\n    It contains the starter documents you need to complete the homework.\n-   Click on the green **CODE** button, select **Use SSH**.\n    Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\n-   In RStudio, go to *File* ‚ûõ *New Project* ‚ûõ*Version Control* ‚ûõ *Git*.\n-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. Again, please make sure to have *SSH* highlighted under *Clone* when you copy the address.\n-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nThe guidelines should feel familiar, as they are the same ones from the lab! They are included below as a reminder.\n\n### Code\n\nCode should follow the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/).\nParticularly,\n\n-   there should be spaces before and line breaks after each `+` when building a `ggplot`,\n-   there should also be spaces before and line breaks after each `|>` in a data transformation pipeline,\n-   code should be properly indented,\n-   there should be spaces around `=` signs and spaces after commas.\n\nAdditionally, all code should be visible in the PDF output, i.e., should not run off the page on the PDF.\nLong lines that run off the page should be split across multiple lines with line breaks.\n\n### Plots\n\n-   Plots should have an informative title and, if needed, also a subtitle.\n-   Axes and legends should be labeled with both the variable name and its units (if applicable).\n-   Careful consideration should be given to aesthetic choices.\n\n### Workflow\n\nContinuing to develop a sound workflow for reproducible data analysis is important as you complete the lab and other assignments in this course.\n\n-   You should have at least 3 commits with meaningful commit messages by the end of the assignment.\n-   Final versions of both your `.qmd` file and the rendered PDF should be pushed to GitHub.\n\n\n# Part 1 -- Feedback from AI\n\nYour answers to the questions in this part should go in the file `hw-1-part-1.qmd`.\n\n## Instructions\n\n[TO DO: Add instructions for AI feedback tool.]\n\n## Packages\n\nIn this part you will work with the **tidyverse** package, which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a \"tidy\" way.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data\n\nWe will use the `midwest` data frame for this lab.\nIt is part of the **ggplot2** R package, so the `midwest` data set is automatically loaded when you load the tidyverse package.\n\nThe data contains demographic characteristics of counties in the Midwest region of the United States.\n\nBecause the data set is part of the **ggplot2** package, you can read documentation for the data set, including variable definitions by typing `?midwest` in the Console or searching for `midwest` in the Help pane.\n\n## Questions\n\n### Question 1\n\nVisualize the distribution of population density of counties using a histogram with `geom_histogram()` with four separate binwidths: a binwidth of 100, a binwidth of 1,000, a binwidth of 10,000, and a binwidth of 100,000.\nFor example, you can create the first plot with:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Population density\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    title = \"Population density of Midwestern counties\",\n    subtitle = \"Binwidth = 100\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou will need to make four different histograms.\nMake sure to set informative titles and axis labels for each of your plots.\nThen, comment on which binwidth is most appropriate for these data and why.\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Question 1\".\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n### Question 2\n\nVisualize the distribution of population density of counties again, this time using a boxplot with `geom_boxplot()`.\nMake sure to set informative titles and axis labels for your plot.\nThen, using information as needed from the box plot as well as the histogram from Question 1, describe the distribution of population density of counties and comment on any potential outliers, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative and commenting on whether it makes sense to you that this county is an outlier.\nYou can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them.\n\n::: callout-important\nIn describing a distribution, make sure to mention shape, center, spread, and any unusual observations.\n:::\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Question 2\".\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n### Question 3\n\nCreate a scatterplot of the percentage below poverty (`percbelowpoverty` on the y-axis) versus percentage of people with a college degree (`percollege` on the x-axis), where the color [**and**]{.underline} shape of points are determined by `state`.\nMake sure to set informative titles, axis, and legend labels for your plot.\nFirst, describe the overall relationship between percentage of people with a college degree and percentage below poverty in Midwestern states, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative.\nYou can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them.\nThen, comment on whether you can identify how this relationship varies across states.\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Question 3\".\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n### Question 4\n\n*Do some states have counties that tend to be geographically larger than others?*\n\nTo explore this question, create side-by-side boxplots of area (`area`) of a county based on state (`state`).\n\nHow do typical county area sizes compare across states?\n\nHow do variabilities of county sizes compare across states?\n\nWhich state has the single largest county? Identify the name of this county. You can use the data viewer to identify it interactively, you do not have to write code.\n\n::: render-commit-push\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\n\nOnce again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n:::\n\n### Question 5\n\n*Do some states have a higher percentage of their counties located in a metropolitan area?*\n\nCreate a segmented bar chart with one bar per state and the bar filled with colors according to the value of `metro` ‚Äì one color indicating `Yes` and the other color indicating `No` for whether a county is considered to be a metro area.\nThe y-axis of the segmented barplot should range from 0 to 1, indicating proportions.\nCompare the percentage of counties in metro areas across the states based on this plot.\nMake sure to supplement your narrative with rough estimates of these percentages.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Hint\n\nFor this question, you should begin with the data wrangling pipeline below.\nWe will learn more about data wrangling in the coming weeks, so this is a mini-preview.\nThis pipeline creates a new variable called `metro` based on the value of the existing variable called `inmetro`.\nIf the value of `inmetro` is equal to 1 (`inmetro == 1`), it sets the value of `metro` to `\"Yes\"`, and if not, it sets the value of `metro` to `\"No\"`.\nThe resulting data frame is assigned back to `midwest`, overwriting the existing `midwest` data frame with a version that includes the new `metro` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmidwest <- midwest |>\n  mutate(metro = if_else(inmetro == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: render-commit-push\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\n\nAnd once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\nWe keep repeating this because it's important and because we see students forget to do this.\nSo take a moment to make sure you're following along with the version control instructions.\n:::\n\n# Part 2 -- Feedback from Humans\n",
