The research question we hope to answer is, “Are individuals who identify as female discriminated against in promotion decisions made by their managers who identify as male?” \n\n- This study considered sex roles, and only allowed for options of “male” and “female”. The identities being considered are not gender identities and the study allowed only for a binary classification of sex.\n\n::: aside\nRosen, B., and T. H.

If you could get your pick, which die would you prefer to play this game with?\n:::\n\n- 6-sided\n- 12-sided\n\n## Interpretation of probability {.smaller}\n\n- Frequentist interpretation:\n  - The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the **random process** an infinite number of times.\n  - Single main stream school until recently.\n  - What we've been using so far in this course.\n\n- Bayesian interpretation:\n  - A Bayesian interprets probability as a subjective degree of belief: For the same event, two separate people could have differing probabilities.\n  - Largely popularized by revolutionary advance in computational technology and methods during the last twenty years.\n\n## Set up {.xsmall}\n\n- I have two dice: one 6-sided, the other 12-sided.\n\n- We're going to play a game where I'm going to call them die A and die B, and you won't know which one is which.\n\n- You pick die A or B, I roll it, and I tell you if you win or not, where winning is getting a number $\\ge$ 4. If you win, you get a piece of candy. If you lose, I get to keep the candy.\n\n- We'll play this multiple times with different contestants.\n\n- I will not swap die A and B at any point.\n\n- We'll record which die each contestant picks and whether they won or lost.\n\n- The ultimate goal is to come to a class consensus about whether A or B is the good die.\n\n- You get to pick how long you want to keep playing, but remember, each time you guess wrong, you lose a piece of candy (so there is a cost associated with too many tries). If you make the wrong decision, you lose all the candy.\n\n## Hypotheses and decisions {.smaller}\n\n![](images/26/hypotheses-decisions.png)\n\n**Sampling isn't free!**\n\nAt each trial you risk losing pieces of candy if you lose (the die comes up $<$ 4). Too many trials means you won't have much candy left. And if we spend too much class time and we may not get through all the material.\n\n## Initial guess {.smaller}\n\n::: question\nYou have no idea if I have chosen A to be the good die (12-sided) or bad die (6-sided). Then, before we collect any data, what is your best guess for A is the good die and B is the bad die?\n:::\n\n- P(A good, B bad) = 0.33; P(A bad, B good) = 0.67\n- P(A good, B bad) = 0.50; P(A bad, B good) = 0.50\n- P(A good, B bad) = 0; P(A bad, B good) = 1\n- P(A good, B bad) = 0.25; P(A bad, B good) = 0.75\n\n## Prior probabilities {.smaller}\n\n- These are your **prior probabilities** for the two competing claims (hypotheses):\n\n  - $H_1$: A good, B bad\n  - $H_2$: A bad, B good\n\n- That is, these probabilities represent what you believe before seeing any data.\n\n- You could have conceivably made up these probabilities, but instead you have chosen to make an educated guess.\n\n# Results\n\n![](images/26/data.png)\n\n## Decision making {.smaller}\n\n::: question\nWhat is your decision?\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n::: question\nHow did you make this decision?\n:::\n\n## Probability tree - roll 1 {.smaller}\n\n::: question\nWhat is the probability, based on the outcome of the {first} roll, that A is the good die (and B is the bad die)?\n:::\n\n## Posterior probability {.xsmall}\n\n- The probability\n\n$$ {P(A~is~good~|~outcome~of~1^{st}~roll)} $$\n\nis also called the **posterior probability**.\n\n- Posterior probability is generally defined as P(hypothesis $|$ data). It tells us the probability of a hypothesis we set forth, given the data we just observed. It depends on both the prior probability we set and the observed data.\n\n- This is different than a p-value (a Frequentist concept) which is roughly P(data $|$ hypothesis).\n\n- In the next iteration (roll) we get to take advantage of what we learned from the data.\n\n- In other words, we update our prior with our posterior.\n\n## Recap: Bayesian inference {.smaller}\n\n- Take advantage of prior information, like a previously published study or a physical model.\n\n- Naturally integrate data as you collect it, and update your priors.\n\n- Avoid the counter-intuitive Frequentist definition of a p-value as the P(observed or more extreme outcome $|$ $H_0$ is true). Instead base decisions on the posterior probability, P(hypothesis is true $|$ observed data).\n\n- **Watch out!** A good prior helps, a bad prior hurts, but the prior matters less the more data you have.\n\n- More advanced Bayesian techniques offer flexibility not present in Frequentist models.\n\n# And finally...\n\n## Thank you!\n\n![](images/26/thank-you.png)\n\n",
