Will send Zoom link on Friday's email and confirm Saturday evening.\n\n## Project deadlines {.smaller}\n\n-   By the end of the day on Friday, 11/7: (Optional) Stop by my or a TAs office hours _as a team_. Either come prepared with\n    -   two concrete questions \n    -   your presentation to do a practice run\n  \n-   Monday (11/10), in your lab session, in person: Project presentation\n\n-   Thursday (11/13), 11:59pm: Project write-up, website, repo (all issues must be closed, final commit must successfully build the website)\n\n-   Friday (11/14), 11:59pm: Peer eval 4 (final one!) on TEAMMATES\n\n# Story development\n\n## Structure: presentation + write-up\n\n-  Start with your goal / high-level question\n\n-  Don't chronicle your steps, but instead tell us a compelling story of what you set out to find and what you found\n\n-  \"No significant results\" or \"no concrete relationships\" are still results -- what did you learn? how deep did you dig and with what tools and techniques?\n\n## \"But...

Through analyzing FADO (Force, Abuse, Discourtesy, Offensive Language) violations by officers’ days on force and victim race, we identify trends in when certain types of misconduct typically occur, understand how those trends vary by victim race, and reveal how racial disproportionalities are present within all offense types.\n\n## The Outliers {.smaller}\n\n**Paying for Purpose: How College Costs and Career Returns Shape Alumni Beliefs About Changing the World**[*]\n\n> We are interested in the relationship between tuition, perception of making world a better place, and return on investment among United States colleges. To explore these intersections we will utilize multiple datasets. Here are our research questions: Are tuition costs and salary potential related to the feeling that they are making the world a better place post graduation, and does this differ whether a school is a state school or not? What factors most strongly correlate to a higher percentage of alumni who believe they are making the world a better place? We hypothesize that attending a public college and making above-average money afterwards will have a relationship to a higher percentage of alumni who believe they are making the world a better place.\n\n::: aside\nTitle generated by ChatGPT 5.
