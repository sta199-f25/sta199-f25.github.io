At Duke, that posture may be tolerable, even expected. But once you’ve seen how Greek life operates (gatekeeping at the door, bending rules for insiders, punishing outsiders) it’s hard not to notice the same logic playing out on a national scale. The United States, too, runs like a frat: immigration represents the rush process, the Constitution and the insiders who decide when those rules apply and when they don’t.\\n\\nThe First Test: Do You Belong?\\n\\nImmigration is America’s bid night. Who gets past the door and who gets turned away, reveals who the frat thinks deserves to wear its letters. \\n\\nIn the late 1800s, the Chinese Exclusion Act was the ultimate “you don’t belong here.” It was the equivalent of a fraternity cutting pledges at the door, not because of merit, but because of appearance.\\n\\nHistorian Andrew Gyory argues in “Closing the Gate: Race, Politics, and the Chinese Exclusion Act,” that the 1882 Chinese Exclusion law wasn’t just about jobs or economics — it was about racial scapegoating weaponized in a crisis. In the recession of the 1870s, white workers blamed Chinese laborers for stealing jobs and depressing wages. Politicians ran with it, branding Chinese immigrants as “coolies” (a slur) who threatened white labor. This act suspended immigration, denied naturalization and subjected exempt merchants and students to humiliating interrogation. \\n\\nThe same script is running today. Just as Chinese laborers were scapegoated during the 1870s downturn, today’s immigrants are painted as threats to American workers. Trump says migrants “steal jobs” and “drive down wages,” while ignoring the actual structural causes of inequality. Wealth-based hurdles for H-1B visas, restrictions on asylum work permits: all built on the same assumption that keeping immigrants out will magically protect American jobs. The target changes, but the logic does not: protect the insiders, keep the outsiders desperate.\\n\\nIt’s not “No Asians allowed” anymore; it’s “You can only enter if you can pay the toll.” The words have shifted — “merit,” “abuse,” “national security” — but the message hasn’t.
