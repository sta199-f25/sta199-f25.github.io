At Duke, that posture may be tolerable, even expected. But once you’ve seen how Greek life operates (gatekeeping at the door, bending rules for insiders, punishing outsiders) it’s hard not to notice the same logic playing out on a national scale. The United States, too, runs like a frat: immigration represents the rush process, the Constitution and the insiders who decide when those rules apply and when they don’t.\\n\\nThe First Test: Do You Belong?\\n\\nImmigration is America’s bid night. Who gets past the door and who gets turned away, reveals who the frat thinks deserves to wear its letters. \\n\\nIn the late 1800s, the Chinese Exclusion Act was the ultimate “you don’t belong here.” It was the equivalent of a fraternity cutting pledges at the door, not because of merit, but because of appearance.\\n\\nHistorian Andrew Gyory argues in “Closing the Gate: Race, Politics, and the Chinese Exclusion Act,” that the 1882 Chinese Exclusion law wasn’t just about jobs or economics — it was about racial scapegoating weaponized in a crisis. In the recession of the 1870s, white workers blamed Chinese laborers for stealing jobs and depressing wages. Politicians ran with it, branding Chinese immigrants as “coolies” (a slur) who threatened white labor. This act suspended immigration, denied naturalization and subjected exempt merchants and students to humiliating interrogation. \\n\\nThe same script is running today. Just as Chinese laborers were scapegoated during the 1870s downturn, today’s immigrants are painted as threats to American workers. Trump says migrants “steal jobs” and “drive down wages,” while ignoring the actual structural causes of inequality. Wealth-based hurdles for H-1B visas, restrictions on asylum work permits: all built on the same assumption that keeping immigrants out will magically protect American jobs. The target changes, but the logic does not: protect the insiders, keep the outsiders desperate.\\n\\nIt’s not “No Asians allowed” anymore; it’s “You can only enter if you can pay the toll.” The words have shifted — “merit,” “abuse,” “national security” — but the message hasn’t. Some people belong. Others don’t. \\n\\nGatekeeping at the border bleeds into gatekeeping the Constitution itself. Once you’re in though, it may not be what you expect it to. \\n\\nInside the House\\n\\nOnce you’re in, the house makes the rules. Fraternities are notorious for setting the tone of how members act, who they associate with and even how they speak. The U.S. works the same way: once you’re past the border, culture and politics dictate what’s acceptable and what’s excused.\\n\\nTrump’s infamous Access Hollywood tape was brushed off as “locker room talk.” Anyone who’s been in a frat knows exactly what that means: a culture where misogyny isn’t condemned; it’s normalized as tradition. And Trump isn’t an outlier. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently scolded generals for being “fat” in the halls of the Pentagon. He said, “It's completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon and leading commands around the country and the world.”\\n\\nWhat starts as frat culture seeps into governance. The overlap isn’t just metaphorical anymore. It’s literal.\\n\\nThe Second Test: Will You Submit?\\n\\nEvery frat has rules, but everyone knows they bend when it suits those in charge. National bylaws formally ban hazing and restrict alcohol, yet incidents from Penn State and Bowling Green prove those rules are selectively enforced. They are college kids, not U.S. government officials. So, no. No leeway here. \\n\\nThe Constitution is supposed to be America’s house bylaws, but we’re watching them get bent the same way fraternity brothers bend their codes of conduct. \\n\\nThe Fifth Amendment says: “No person shall … be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” No person. Not no citizen. Yet under Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, Venezuelan migrants have been deported straight into El Salvador’s prisons — without hearings, charges or convictions. That’s not due process. That’s rule by decree.\\n\\nThe First Amendment is also under attack. Student activists like Rümeysa Öztürk have been detained by ICE for nothing more than co-writing an article. Visas revoked, scholars deported — not because of crime, but because of speech. This amendment also doesn’t specify “citizens,” it specifies “the people.”\\n\\nThe Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause is hanging by a thread. Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship — blocked in court but revealing in intent — openly defies the guarantee that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States… are citizens.” If the president of the United States feels free to ignore the Constitution’s plain text, what comes next?\\n\\nThe Third Test: Will You Stay Silent? \\n\\nI don’t deny a country, or a club, has the right to control its borders or rules.

vote choice for different racial groups are often inferred using aggregate election results and racial composition.\n> Over the past several decades, many statistical methods have been proposed to address this ecological inference problem.\n> We propose an alternative method to reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from voter registration records.\n> Building on the existing methodological literature, we use Bayes’s rule to combine the Census Bureau’s Surname List with various information from geocoded voter registration records.\n> We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using approximately nine million voter registration records from Florida, where self-reported ethnicity is available.\n> We find that it is possible to reduce the false positive rate among Black and Latino voters to 6% and 3%, respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate above 80%.\n> Moreover, we use our predictions to estimate turnout by race and find that our estimates yields substantially less amounts of bias and root mean squared error than standard ecological inference estimates.\n> We provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology.\n> The open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology.\n\n## **wru** package\n\nThe said “source software” is the wru package:
